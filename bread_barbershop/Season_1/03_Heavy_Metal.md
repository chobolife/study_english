- Yes my newest masterpiece. I call it rage hair.
- Huh?
- A new method of styling rage hair. In order to give you what you wanted I had to first draw out all of your rage.
- It was your plan?
- You knew what you were doing all along?
- We're sorry. We thought you had just made a mistake.
- I thought you were just a creepy old toast trying to rip us off. But you were just doing your job.
- That's right, and now it's time to pay.
- Ah yeah of course.
- Yo how much you guys got?
- I don't really think we have a hundred bucks
- It seems we're short 50.
- I didn't include tax.
