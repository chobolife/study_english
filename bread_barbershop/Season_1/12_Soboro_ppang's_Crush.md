# Soboro ppang's Crush

- No, I'm going to be late! I have to be on time for this meeting. Oh. Oh, man. What just happened?
- Get him! Somebody stop that guy.
- Scream.
- Give it back to her. I don't want to have to fight you.
- Don't let go of my leg.
- That's him.
- Ah, fine! You ugly weirdo.
- Geez louise.
- Are you all right?
- Yes I'm... Ah...
* * *
- Hey, you're not hurt, are you?
- Okay, calm down. Just play it cool.
- Here's your wallet.
- Thanks a bunch.
- Okay, gotta go. See you.
- Hang on. I'd like to take you out for a meal sometime. How's that sound?
- Uh, that sounds awesome, anytime is good.
* * *
- She was so nice. I should get prepared.
- Hey guys. Tomorrow I'm gonna go eat with a really pretty girl. Any advice?
- Nice! About time you started dating.
- Congrats. What kind of outing will it be?
- Um... Don't you have a streusel crust?
- Hmm, yes. My outer layer actually does give me some self-confidence issues. It's tough.
- Yeah girls don't really like crusty skin.
- What should I do about it?
- Get rid of it if you can.
- I'm sure under all those sugary bits there's a good-looking guy.
- Why not try the Bread Barbershop? A lot of people's problems have been fixed by the Bread Barber.
- Bread Barber?
* * *
- Looks like a lot of work. That nose could be fixed along with overall hair quality too. But the biggest issue is that sugar crust.
- Oh... I want to look like this. Is that possible?
- You're asking me to do something seemingly impossible, which is why you've come to the right place. I can do anything.
- Thank you sir.
* * *
- You all right with a little pain?
- Sure of course. I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Give me all you got.
- Let's start. Tweezers!
* * *
- Stay tuned. This part requires precision.
- It'll take forever.
- That's true. I'll have to use this.
- A mask that peels off?
- Just stay still. Hang on.
- As long as I look good tomorrow, it's worth all the... PAIN!
* * *
- Is that me? I'm a whole new bread.
- And that's not all. We're not finished. This season's hottest color, pale pink, will look great on you.
- Some rainbow sprinkles and a powdered sugar dust to top it all off.
- There. You really are a whole new bun. She'll fall in love with you now.
- Wow, it's unbelievable! Thank you sir. I have a new sense of confidence now.
- Wait, one more thing. Since you are still a soboro bread, your sugar crust will come back and your date in three hours time.
- Yep. Got it, sir.
* * *
- Oh man. Gotta hurry. Don't wanna be late.
- Don't cry little buddy. What's wrong?
- My balloon.
- Yeah almost... Almost there.
- Here you go, careful.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.
* * *
- Not late.
- If these don't sell, I won't be able to buy gifts for my grandkids.
- Let me help you please. I'll push from behind.
- It's quite heavy. Are you certain?
- Yes of course. We can get it pass this hill together.
* * *
- Holy crust I'm a whole hour late now.
- Oh, man. My old face. How can I meet cookie with all this crust?
- Is that you? What took you so long? I was about to leave since you stood me up.
- I know I just wanted to look handsome. I tried to be here on time.
- You know a proper man shows up on time and doesn't look disheveled. But the best kind of man is a kind-hearted one, like you Mr. Soboro.
- Yep just like you. You only look disheveled because you helped that little boy get his balloon back. And you were late because you helped that old woman with her heavy cart.
- You saw that?
- That's right. You did so many good deeds today Mr. Soboro.
- Ah...
- Know what I think? I think we should meet up more. What do you think, Soboro? Wanna date me? No?
- Yes, I do. That sounds awesome.
- Go! I'm gonna stick right by you.
- Oh, wow. I never thought my kind deeds would result in a girl as nice as you.
- You're pretty nice yourself.
