- One million dollars? Why is it just a measly one million?
- Don't think it's so easy to take me down? Stupid cardboard.
- We received a report of a bully pie in this vicinity.
- But it doesn't look like he's still around. Let's find somewhere else to look.

- Come on. This Bread Barber guy. Bring him here right now. I don't want to wait.
- Huh?
- What's this thing? Are you saying I gotta wait you for real? Don't you know who I am?
- Well, should I? We go to the same school or something?
- I'll just see myself to the back of the line.

- Listen good. Change everything about my appearance, unrecognizable.
- A total makeover. Now your face is quite crusty
