# Bully Pie

- No way!
- Mommy!
- That's what happens when you get my way you puny donut hole. What are you looking at? Buzz off!
- It's the dreaded bully pie.
- Listen to this. He stole a whole bag of chocolate chips, and ate them all at once.
- I heard that he broke out of maximum broiler prison.
***
- One million dollars? Why is it just a measly one million?
- Don't think it's so easy to take me down? Stupid cardboard.
- We received a report of a bully pie in this vicinity.
- But it doesn't look like he's still around. Let's find somewhere else to look.
- There are pain in the buns. There must be some way to hide from them.
- Bread Barber. That's perfect.
***
- So this is the famous shop, huh?
- Oh, what in the name of biscance.
- Hmm? Oh hey there, this door actually opens outwards.
- I don't care. Get lost!
***
- Come on. This Bread Barber guy. Bring him here right now. I don't want to wait.
- Huh?
- What's this thing? Are you saying I gotta wait? You for real? Don't you know who I am?
- Well, should I? We go to the same school or something?
- I'll just see myself to the back of the line.
***
- Number 37, your turn.
- Who? here. I mean, what took you so long, kid? Scram!
- Listen good. Change everything about my appearance, unrecognizable.
- A total makeover. Now your face is quite crusty.
- What are you doing?
- It won't be easy, but I love a good challenge.
- You don't nerve.
- You'd better do a good job. Or... mark my words. I'll burn this place to the ground.
- That will not be necessary. I'll change that ugly face yet.
- What? Why you are ...
- I'll advise you not to move. These tools are sharp.
***
- I guess it's pretty good.
- Oh, this is good? Just look at this mess. How is this good? Here and here... the evil is still showing all over your face.
- My bling bling shoddy stars look has never failed before. You've tainted my style with your mean looking face.
- You sure you're not a criminal or something?
- But wait. I look like a pretty princess cupcake.
- Come on, Bread. You can do this. Right. Let's see what I can do.
***
- Oh. It's perfect. Wow. No one will know it's me. How much do I owe you?
- No, no, no, no. It's still not right. What did you do in a past life to deserve this crusty old mug?
- My marshmallow perm has never failed so hard before the likes of you.
- Hey this hair makes me look like a sugary delight. Don't you think so?
- Ah the horror. My eyes are burning. Choco, shut the door. Wilk, tell everyone we're closed.
- Here we go again.
***
- Nobody leaves this place until I make this right as green, nobody! Get ready for an all-nighter.
- Geez, am I really that bad?
- See you tomorrow Master Bread.
***
- Oh, I'm finally a whole new pie.
- That's right. I knew the sweet pretty lady pie would do the trick. I sure do impress myself.
- Oh thank you so much, Mr Bread. You're all right in my book.
- Thank you Mister. See you soon.
***
- Good luck finding that stale old pie. I'm turning over a new leaf in life.
