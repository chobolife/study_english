# Employee of the Month

- Um. Wilk, Choco.
- Huh?
- Yes, coming.
- Hmm? What is it now?
- Tomorrow is the day we decide on our employee of the month.
- What of the month?
- Uh.
- Employee of the month. Goes to the employee who always goes the extra mile.
- Before this month, Choco won it every single time.
- I was the only one working here.
- Don't remind me.
- That is why now it will be a fierce fight.
- My two employees battling it out for the honor of having their photo featured up here.
- Oh, wow.
- Wait. That's not all. Employee of the month will also win a special prize.
- A prize?
- What is it, sir?
- That special prize is having a free dinner with me.
- Oh. How cool! Dinner with master Bread.
* * *
- Check it out. Wilk is out to dinner with Master Bread himself.
- What a good employee he is.
* * *
- Ah, I look forward to seeing which of you proves to be the best one.
- Yes, sir.
* * *
- I'm out. Later.
- Great day today Master Bread. Get home safe and I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yep.
- And have good dreams, too.
- Yep.
- Did I mention I'll see you tomorrow?
- Not if you don't leave.
- So you really want employee of the month, huh?
- That's right. Don't you want it as well?
- Ugh, no. I can't think of anything worse. Dinner with Master Bread? Just us? Don't make me barf.
- What? I just don't understand.
- I'm just gonna put in minimal effort like I do every day.
- Wilk, please make sure you win, okay? Understand?
- Yeah, got it Choco. I'll become the greatest employee of the month of all time.
* * *
- Today's the day to prove myself. I'm gonna be the first person at work.
- How to become the best employee you can be.
- Chapter one, part one. Say hello to your boss with pride.
- Hello, Master Bread. How are you today?
- Keep it down out there.
- It's too early for this.
* * *
- I think I should clean up the shop before anyone comes in. I can see it now.
- Good job, Wilk. You should be employee of the month every single time.
- So be it. It's time to clean up.
* * *
- All done. Now time to throw away the trash.
- Well done, Choco. It's so clean. You've really outdone yourself this time.
- This wasn't me.
- Great job. No need to be so humble about it.
- You're late today, Wilk. Choco could teach you a thing or two.
- Master Bread, you don't understand.
- Just get to work.
- But wait.
* * *
- If I clean extra hard where he can see me, I know he'll be proud of me then.
- Huh?
- Gracious. Your employee really seems to love his work.
- Wilk, I don't need to evaluate you anymore today. Because you're clearly the best.
- Master Bread.
- Perfect plan.
- For sure is dirty.
- Hey.
- Gotta keep those mirrors clean.
- No good if you can't see yourself.
- Huh, sir? You've got dust on you.
- There.
- You seem to be sweating but never fear. I'll clean it up.
- Oh man, something smells gross.
- Oh, my gosh. This is the toilet rag.
- Why are you testing me today? Make yourself useful somewhere else.
* * *
- Now that's what an employee of the month looks like.
- Hard at work, taking things seriously.
- Wilk, you should learn from her. Working hard in silence.
- Huh?
* * *
- Wilk, this isn't working. What's going on?
- You're making me look good and that's bad.
- I'm sorry, Choco.
- Wilk, bring me ketchup.
- Wilk, this is your last chance. Just try not to mess this up.
- Got it. Coming Master Bread.
- Ketchup, ketchup... Oh, found them.
- Hang on. These are really small.
- Maybe there's a bigger one here.
* * *
- Yes, this is how I win.
- My precious Wilk, you took the time to bring me this giant ketchup. What a grand employee.
- Come. It's time to eat at a fancy restaurant with me.
- Yes, Master Bread.
- Better be quick.
- Hmm. What's taking the kid so long?
- Master Bread, your ketchup as you requested. It took a while because as you can see it's a little large.
- Hey, Master Bread.
- WILK!
* * *
- Choco must be having the time of her life out to dinner with Master Bread.
- And then you know what happened? I won the hairstyling competition again. My fifth consecutive win.
- Every year.
