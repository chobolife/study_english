# Intern's Secret

- When sweeping the floor, one should hold the broom at approximately 45 degrees for maximum efficiency.
- Ah... I'm learning so much. Would have thought? Master Bread's the best. If I work hard, I can be just him someday.
***
- Are you okay? Don't move. I'll help you.
- Morning. I'm ready to work.
- Hmm... So, tell me why you want to be an intern.
- Well, someday I want to be a great barber like you.
- That's nice, but I'm afraid we're not hiring anyone in the shop right now.
- All right.
- Wilk, now put her out, would you?
- You got it.
***
- Princess! Did he hurt you?
- She's... a princess?
- That's right. We're booked for the next decade.
- There's no space for all this cash.
***
- Wait, I've made a huge mistake here. You possess a talent I can't miss.
- Huh?
- Seems to me your legs look strong. That's perfect for working at a barber shop.
- Oh, you think so?
- Strength is vital. When you're standing on your feet forever, you must be strong.
- So... I could be a natural?
- Yep. Then, you start tomorrow morning.
- Thanks a lot!
***
- I'm late. This is bad. I've never once been late.
- Almost!
- Right on time too. What a responsible worker.
***
- Wilk, Miss Cake. I'm going out to buy things. Make sure to clean those mirrors good. I want to see them shine.
- Yup. You bet.
- No worries, Mr Bread.
- I'm gonna make these things sparkle like he's said to.
- Miss Cake, you should clean the mirrors like you said or he'll get mad at you.
- Oh yeah that. What are we supposed to do?
***
- Now that's what I call shine. Yes. You truly have an eye for this.
***
- Hey Wilk, I'll throw that away for you.
- Um, are you sure?
- Of course. I think I'm getting better at this whole working thing or whatever it's called.
- Who was it? Who's responsible for this?
- My... My car!
- It looks so old. So I thought it was garbage too.
***
- Princess, as you asked.
- I thought about how hard it must be driving around in that old rusty lemon of a car.
- That's why I brought all mine for you.
- I just thought you can pick one of mine to use.
- Ah, you'll make a great barber someday. You fixed your mistake. That's a great virtue to have.
***
- Well done. Congratulations on finishing your salon apprenticeship. You did great. Here's your certificate. Welcome aboard.
- Good job. Our princess finally did it.
- You always had it inside you, Miss.
- Yeah, so I'm not actually going to work here anymore.
- What do you mean?
- My dad said if I got certified he'd give me my own salon to use and stuff on my own. But thanks for the training and all.
***
- Oh my. I hope it's not too busy. What fun. Ah?
- What's going on?
- Bread barbershop? Huh? Show the princess learn from him?
- For him to teach her he must be even better than she is. Let's go to the source. He's the original anyway.
- Come on. Let's go find him.
