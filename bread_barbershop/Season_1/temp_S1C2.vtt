it's all the same right they're all just
leaves anyway
please and water in a pot
one black tea master bread thanks
wilk this is green tea not black tea huh

difference between greed and black
try it yourself but all teas taste the
same to me
see you tomorrow have a good night
master bread
hey choco are green tea and black tea
the same of course not
why when master brett asked for black
tea i made him green tea instead and he
got all mad
i thought they were all the same you
don't know anything do you kid
tea is a part of our history in ancient
times a sticky rice cake brewed the best
tea
he served this tea to the king it was so
good
he made that sticky rice cake the prime
minister
so making tea is ingrained in bakery
town whoa
so if i make good tea master bread will
make me prime minister or something
uh worth a shot yeah i'm not that good
at cleaning or stuff like that but maybe
making tea can be my thing then master
bread will love me
[Applause]
time to master a new hobby boil the
water to 100 degrees first
okay the ratio of leaves to water should
be one to

leaf water anyway
[Music]

would travel the world
and become a favorite barber of ancient
pharaohs
legend says his scissors crafted many
works of art
like the great sphinx statue he's known
to have cried let my pastries go as he
parted the bread sea
some even say his scissors broke the
first supercontinent
into seven

my side

he'll have to pass down
he can't close master bread
there you are why are you yelling before
10 a.m
i heard dishland is going to come
it's time he's finally come but i still
don't understand who this dishlan is
just the finest hair styling magazine of
all time
three stars has the highest honor a hair
salon can be awarded
however most get zero and end up losing
all their customers
choco i need you to find out exactly
when this muffin is coming to our shop
it says he usually drops by unannounced
but he tends to come in wednesdays at
noon
isn't today a wednesday wednesday the
13th

so this is the bread barber let's just
hope he lives up to all the good things
i've heard

[Music]
mr fred are you okay you seem to be
twitching
well i'm fine only a fool would be
nervous today

inspires us all to be more kind
[Music]
amazing he's an entirely new person now
[Music]

every head of hair
no matter if the customer is rich or
poor

bathroom then why didn't you say that

ranger
cat good take you know all the fangirls
will really love that one
let's do the next scene now ranger
kicked my buns
donut ranger always clenches his fist
when he donut kicks the enemy but i
clearly saw a thumb sticking out of the
side
which ruins it i know and they're
getting the name wrong too
it's not ranger kick it's ranger ultra
kick now ugh
they've got donut ranger all wrong looks
like this movie's ignoring the donut
ranger universe
i know episodes four through six of the
original donut ranger trilogy were
amazing beyond words
these prequels don't hold a candle to
the original ones
by you what's going on here you need to
zoom in extra close on donut ranger so
the explosions look extra explosiony
oh i don't look at this
this lighting is all wrong for donut
ranger kilo is unflattering for his
donut hole
oh no wilk is right this light should be
blue what are you doing to him
why are you here this is a close set get
out we haven't done anything wrong you
can't kick us out we're just really big
fans of donut ranger
fans are the absolute worst things to
have now get out
excuse me we have something to say to
you
what do you mean you quit you never pay
us on time and i've got a mortgage
there's not even craft services
wait wait we can work this out tough
luck i gotta feed little ones at home
you can call us again once you have an
actual budget how am i supposed to make
this movie without
bad guys come back
looks like someone's in need of a couple
of actors that's right
and some of us have a little acting
experience under our belts too
all right weirdos you good never better
back in my day i was the fastest rising
star in the world
i had to leave the industry just so
someone else could have a fighting
chance
this is my triumphant return yeah
whatever that's all great
rolling action
[Music]
doughnut ranger it's your turn time to
fight
cockat what on earth oh was it was that
too good
only if you're a robot put some feeling
into it
oh my expressions are too subtle for the
big screen back when i studied meisner
method at bread state universe
well it's up to you yeah you can count
on me sir i have every line from the
comic books memorized by heart
don't care rolling action
[Music]
what was the line again it's harder to
remember now that i'm on camera
holy cannoli here
this next scene is an action shot where
you chase the hero firing lasers
don't mess it up of course i won't i
never once needed a stunt double
yeah yeah now i got a headache
[Music]
why are you making the sound effects
yourself i'm a method actor i do my own
offense
no we have the sound effects later in
post from now on only say what's in the
script
and another thing what's wrong with you
you get dropped on your head as a kid
yeah i don't know don't dance back to me
are you two a toast
i understand but i milk not toast
okay in this next scene donut range is
captured by aliens
it's a stun shot so you'll have to hit
him as hard as you can you got that
rolling action this is it donut ranger
[Applause]
[Music]
oh no i can't do it sir red is my
favorite ranger since i was a little kid
red ranger's been my hero i could never
hit you red instead i would take a hit
for you
i can make that happen
other bread you're up now you can't be
mentally weak if you want to be an actor
now
watch the master
no i can't do it either
[Laughter]
are you okay in this scene there's a
kick in midair
you both attack the struggling ranger
it's the big climax of the movie so
don't mess it up
let's just see if we can get one thing
right i am an actor
i'll bring out all the stops for the
most important scene in the movie
let's go we got this let's give this a
shot
rolling action
good work do the money shots
[Music]
get out i don't want to see any more of
you two i'm hiring some new actors
what no director please give us a chance
to be in the movie
we'll do anything i promise i won't mess
up anymore please let us serve please
no chance you won't ruin this for me do
we have new actors yet
we don't we can't film anything anymore
our lighting is broken along with the
spirits of most of the crew and also our
cameron boom
then just go buy some new equipment our
production budget doesn't have anything
left yeah why won't this day ever end
step for cash huh how much will it cost
i've always wanted to invest please
movies costs more than a few bucks we're
talking big time money here
wilk how much money is in my account 54
69 000 sir if he wants to be an investor
let's go along
you should definitely take what he gives
you i mean you want to get paid too
right
since he's willing to pay up but they're
still the worst
how do i salvage these messes into an
acceptable performance
we meet again prepare to fight
cut okay moving on
awesome next scene about time he
recognized how great my
acting is me too i think i'm finally
getting this stuff
i'm sure he had to pretend to criticize
us before
i know he had to save face in front of
the crew and such
what's the line again perfect great work
wow i'm in a real movie it's a dream
come true isn't it
amateur hey
it's starting donut ranger episode 15
attack of the robocarbs huh robo

what nonsense popcorn is gonna get a
piece of my
one of my mind ended up getting cut that
director must think we're a couple of
adults
these villains were my favorite so far
so unique i wonder
how they did it it didn't look like cgi
at all
of course they're the best villains yet
portraying a cold heartless robot is a
feat very few can do
yeah you're right only your incredible
acting skills could capture the robot
feelings
and i was there too time to go back to
work
