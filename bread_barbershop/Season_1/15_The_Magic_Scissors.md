# The Magic Scissors

- Sometimes it feels like no one has cleaned the storage room for hundreds of years.
- It'll take ages to catch up with.
- What's this?
- Within this box lies the spirit of king Tutan-caramel.
- Tutan who? I've never heard of him.
- Huh? What are these? It's just really old scissors. I hope to be treasure or something like that.
- Wilk, get up here.
- Yeah! On my way.
- Wilk, come help me decorate his hair.
- Me? Help you?
- Nothing tricky. Just cut up a strawberry and put it on the customer's head after.
- You have the scissors already.
- What if I mess up? Calm down. You got this. You can do it.
- What in the world?
* * *
- Wow, it's perfect. It's just what I wanted. What amazing style! You're so good. How did you do that all so fast?
- I actually want that guy to do my hair.
- I assure you I'm the top barber at this job. You're in good hands here.
- I don't care. I want that guy to do it for me instead.
- Wait. No. Come back.
- Me too! I want that guy too.
- How come this guy hasn't styled here before?
- Oh this Tutan-caramel thing might be real after all.
* * *
- Tutan-caramel... hey I found it! King Tutan-caramel was the greatest barber in all of ancient world history.
* * *
- Armed with his mystical scissors he would travel the world and become a favorite barber of ancient pharaohs.
- Legend says his scissors crafted many works of art like the Great Sphinx Statue.
- He's known to have cried let my pastries go as he parted the Bread Sea.
- Some even say his scissors broke the first supercontinent into seven.
* * *
- Wow. This guy was the real deal.
- With these at my side I bet I can become a legendary barber just like Master Bread.
* * *
- Choco, good morning.
- Wilk, what happened yesterday?
- Huh? what?
- Overnight you became really good at this. Customers have been requesting your services.
- Uh I...
- I guess Wilk's finally ready to try his hand at this. After all it's only natural he's good, he was trained by me.
- From what I saw yesterday the student has become the Master I think.
- What now?
- Just beginner's luck.
* * *
- Hello I heard the genius barber works here.
- Yes. How can I be observed?
- It's you, the famous barber Wilk.
- How soon can I get an appointment with you?
- You probably have a lot of reservations, don't you?
* * *
- Holy Buns! I never dreamed I could look this cool.
- Suede crests. I can't believe our town has such a great barber here.
- GO WILK! GO WILK!
- Wilk's preoccupied, so someone needs to clean up around here.
* * *
- So tell me. Just where did you learn all these genius techniques from?
- Master Bread taught me everything I need to know.
- Ah of course. Would you say he's your inspiration?
- Choco, I cleaned Sausage's dookies again.
- Great. Make sure you get the piddle in the corner too.
* * *
- Done! Super cool. Maybe it's cause you're fresh milk but you look good at any angle.
- Thanks a bunch.
- Master bread. Toilet's clog.
- Stupid toilet clogs every day.
* * *
- These things are the best! At this rate I don't know what I do without them.
- Wilk, you have that talk show today.
- Uh yep. Be right there.
- I should really hide these. This'll work.
- Well. Do your best and stuff.
- Always do.
* * *
- Where'd Wilk go?
- He had to go interview on some talk show.
- Also if you're done with the bathroom, you should do Wilk's office next.
- I'm getting too old for this. That's what I get for letting my student get too good.
- Mmm? I don't remember these. They're covered in rust.
- That's just dangerous. These are useless.
- Candy~ It's a sweet taffy candy here. Sweet candy.
- Hey you. Let me trade some candy for this.
- What am I supposed to do with this old chunk?
- Here.
- One piece?
- Might be generous. That taffy's high quality.
- Oh, You're right.
- Well, I guess this'll cut taffy.
- Oh? It's the design I've dreamed of making since I was young.
- I don't know what these scissors are, but they'll make me the greatest candy maker ever.
- Candy~ Get your candy.
* * *
- You what? Master Bread, what in the crust did you do?
- Is it so bad to trade trash for candy?
- You don't get it, do you? They were magic.
- Oh, hush. We can just get you another pair.
- I can't. Those were the only ones.
* * *
- A tacky vendor has become the talk of the town with his new art piece.
- Twisted bread is the artist behind this amazing piece.
- Tell us, what's the secret behind your vision?
- I don't know I guess you do something long enough you get good.
