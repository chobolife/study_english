# Sushi Tourists

- We finally arrived in bakery town. We'll begin our tour.
- All right.
- Look! This is the Cake Palace.
- Wow, it's spectacular.
- This castle's so nice.
***
- Oh.
- It's Butter?
- We love you.
***
- Oh-ho. I heard there were tourists from Sushi town here, and they look like suckers.
- They say Sushi town tourists are rich.
- Now how do I rip them off so I'm the rich one instead?
- Aha! Yes. That's so dumb it might work.
***
- What's this? Discount merchandise.
- And all of butter too.
- He's so cute.
- This one and this one too. What a deal!
- Early chip catches the fish.
- Now to sell all this stuff at a markup.
- Ah! Hey, Tuna. Your sashimi hair is gone.
- Huh? But where could it have gone? Salmon, your hair is gone as well. You're just as bold as I am.
- Ah! My salmon! It's gone.
- My roll. My precious fish eggs.
- Who would even do such a thing?
- Oh I knew traveling to a foreign place was dangerous. They took it right off our heads?
- Hey, read that.
- Come to this location if you want your hair back.
- This guy is the culprit. Let's go. Move out.
- We gotta hurry before it gets stale oh I'm so mad.
- They are so rude.
- Battle cry time. Let's go.
- Give us our hair.
***
- Whoa there they are all. They all look so nice.
- Those are ours.
- Yeah, it's a vending machine.
- One million?
- That is a lot.
- Those belong to us. Smash the machine open.
- Yeah.
- They belong to who now?
- What do you mean? They clearly belong to me.
- And breaking my private property will land you right in jail.
- Police, you know that right?
- Hey! You're a thief! You stole our hair.
- You were holding our hair for ransom.
- Sorry, I can't budge on price. That's just how business works in Bakery town.
- By the way, how will you get back on the plane without any hair on your head?
- Without your precious sashimi, none of you look anything like your passport photos.
- So if any of you want to go home again, bring me some cold hard cash.
- That, that monster...
- Tuna, get ahold of yourself.
***
- I guess we're stuck here. We can never go home now.
- No. We can't give up. What can we do?
- Oh look, it's... That sign is about butter.
- I know he's handsome, but that doesn't help?
- We need to focus on getting our hair back.
- No. Look again. It says he gets his hair styled at that famous barber shop.
***
- Huh?
- Does Master Bread work here?
- Welcome, sir. What can we do for you?
- Well, uh... We came from Sushi town. Someone stole our hair and we need help.
- Wilk, what's wrong?
- Ma... Master Bread!
- Please sir, our hair was stolen. We originally had beautiful heads of sashimi.
- So we can't get back to our home country, if we don't look the same. There must be something you can do.
- Please.
***
- So each of you is a real authentic piece of sushi.
- But you won't be able to get home, if all you are is balls of rice. Is that right?
- That's right.
- You'll be fine. I'll make sure you all get home safe and sound.
- Wilk, go get some jelly from the storeroom.
- Okay.
***
- Sir Takoyaki crafted this knife himself.
- Um...
- Wow.
***
- This is incredible, Master Bread.
- You really are amazing.
- You're all too kind.
- We can try out more styles the next time you come to bakery town.
- Master Bread.
- Thank you, Master Bread.
- True genius.
***
- You're on another magazine.
- What could it be this time?
- Uh, I try to be humble, but I'm too good. Being a celebrity has its challenges.
- Uh... We've got about a million customers here.
- You're joking. Oh.
- I'm so excited.
***
- Now all I've got is a shot full of rotting fish. Maybe a million was steep.
