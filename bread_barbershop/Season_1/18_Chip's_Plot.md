# Chip's Plot

- No! My hair! It looks idiot.
- I don't understand how you still have a job. I'm never coming back.
- Wait! Come back. Please.
***
- Why does everyone think this bread guy is so great?
- Wilk! Come on, Wilk. This isn't that hard. Don't drop the toppings.
- That poor kid's probably just doing his best.
- You're doing a great job. Really great stuff.
- My favorite little employee.
- Master bread is known for being strict and mean, which means this kid must be really good.
- Ha. Looks like I should do some recruiting today.
***
- See you tomorrow. Good night.
- Can't wait to play games with Cheese.
- Hey, Wilk.
- Huh? Oh, potato chip, right?
- Yep. What do you say we have a chat?
- What for?
- Wilk, what do you think about coming to work for me?
- Go work at your shop? No, no.
- Just think it over. Here's my card.
- I'll pay you double whatever you're making at Bread's place.
- Double?
- On top of that we have cool stuff like stock options and vacation days and the likes.
- Sorry, but no.
- Huh?
- I wouldn't trade anything for my job at Bread Barbershop. Plus, I don't even know what stock options are. See ya.
- Well, loyal on top of being a good worker. Now I really gotta make him work for me.
***
- A raise would be nice, but Mr. Bread's more important than money.
- There you are!
- Oh, landlady.
- When are you gonna pay up on your rent? You're three months late.
- I know. I'm sorry ma'am.
- Move out by the end of the week if you can't pay up.
***
- Hello, it's Wilk. Huh? Our mom needs surgery soon? Yeah, okay. I'll send money over there.
- Huh? I haven't paid the water bill or gas or electricity? I need money.
- Hi. Mr. Chip? Yes, it's me.
***
- Come see. Wilk dropped off a letter for you.
- That's weird. What did it say?
- He said he's quitting.
- Hmm. Is that so? Let's start work.
***
- Look at me hiring my own employee. I better be a good boss on his first day of work. But why isn't he here yet?
- Mr. Chip! I'm so sorry that I'm so late.
- Come on. How can you be late on your first day? Welcome.
- Your hair salon is farther from my place than Bread Barbershop. I had to run.
- You live far? That's tough. Hang on.
- Huh? What's going on?
- It's a personal driver for Wilk. So now you'll come to work in this wow.
- That's awesome.
- He'll pick you up at your house every day.
***
- So let's see what you're made of.
- Okay. Where should I clean up first?
- No, no. Give me that. You're too talented for cleaning. I mean, let's see how good you are at styling.
- What? You sure you want me to?
- Yeah. As an ex-employee of Master Bread, I can't wait to see what you can do. Hmm. A customer. Here's your shot.
- Huh?
- Oh man. It's the first time I've styled anyone. Hmm. Time to give it my all.
- Ah! What did you even do? I'm never coming back here again.
- No, please.
- What was that?
- Well... It's been a while so my muscles are stiff you know.
- You have stiff muscles? You should have told me so.
- Huh?
- What's going on now?
- Duh? I've obviously hired the best masseuses in town to help you out. We can work again once you're all better.
- Thanks a bunch.
***
- My phone's not working. I don't know why.
- No worries. Just use mine.
- Whoa. Thanks a bunch.
***
- I'm starving.
- Hungry huh? Well, that won't do.
- Might as well fly out to the real thing.
- Best lunch ever.
***
- I'm in a total food coma.
- You tired? Good thing I have this nap station.
- This is the greatest.
***
- What a ridiculous meme.
- This guy better be the outstanding employee Bread says he is.
- Hey Wilk.
- What?
- I need to go run errands outside the shop. Look after things for me.
- Wait. So what do I do if we don't get any customers?
- Ah, you can just hang out. What do I care.
- One more thing. My friend really wants to see my new workplace. Can he come over?
- Uh, whatever, it's fine.
- Sweet! Thanks boss.
- Be sure to promote the shop to them and maybe offer a discount.
- You got it.
***
- Ah... How nice to have an employee look after the store while I'm gone.
***
- I know, right? There was raspberry filling everywhere.
- Wilk, what's going on!
- Oh, hey. You're back sir.
- Wilk! That's the last straw. This place is a mess. What did you even do?
- Well.. You did say that I could have a friend here so I invited cheese over.
- But Sausage hurt and got jealous and wanted to come over too.
- And then I thought it'd be rude not to invite Choco.
- Oh, and the massage therapists are just really nice so I invited...
- I can't take it anymore.
***
- Bread, what is that milk carton kid's problem?
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I mean. Look at what he's done to my shop. It's a disaster.
- Ah so that's where Wilk went. He went to work for the likes of you.
- This is all your fault. You gotta take it back.
- But you're the one who wanted him in the first place. It seems the kid is your problem now.
- Choco and the dog I miss, though. 
- Ah, you crusty old monster.
- Has anyone seen master potato chip? Is everything...
- But... Please don't fight, violence is bad. Are they fighting over me?
- Give Wilk back. He's the best employee we've ever had in the history of ever.
- You'll never get him. Wilk's the coolest and best worker of all time.
- Take Choco and Sausage, anyone, not Wilk!
***
- Mr. Chip! I know you wanna give me a job, but violence is not the answer. I could never work for someone who beats people up like you. I'll work for Master Bread forever.
- You what?
- Sir, did he hurt you? I'll never leave you again Master Bread.
- No. Ah...
- I'm so sorry.
***
- No customers for the fifth day in a row.
- Wilk, are you even listening? Custard never goes to the jelly pill. Never.
- Sorry, Master Bread. I'll remember next time.
- No. I think I'm okay with that.
- Clean this up right now.
- Sure thing, sir.
