# Job Test

- Master Bread! Can't you help me clean this stuff off? Oh, so gross.
- Hey, can I get a different magazine?
- Did you hear me? I need this cleaned now.
- I've read this one.
- Choco, can you help me?
- There's so many things left to do. Plus, I don't do hair, just a cashier.
- Oh, there's so much to do here. The full loaf of me wouldn't be enough.
- Why don't you just hire an assistant to help you out?
* * *
- I hope someone applies quick.
- Hi there, sir. My name is Wilk White. I want to apply for the job.
- Well, that's real quick.
- I've been dreaming about working at the Bread Barbershop my whole life. Then your sign says you're hiring? Today's the day my dream comes true.
- Really? But how long have you been alive?
- My mom tells me the story. When I was born, I cut my own umbilical cord and picked scissors to play over everything else. Other kids like to cut paper, but not me, I wanted to cut hair.
- In rock paper scissors, scissors wins every time. I'll be the best assistant you could ever ask for.
- Yeah, okay, sure. You'll still need to pass a job test to work here, however.
- Anything for you sir.
* * *
- Um, let's get on with that test.
- First test, three layers of whipped cream.
- I bet this will be a piece of cake, even though I failed the subject a bunch of times. I'm sure it's something I can do.
- Wow. Mr. Bread, is this the very same whipped cream that you use? Time to show you what great work I can do and get the job.
- Uh, it's not working hang on.
- It's stuck, but I'll just press hard and see what I can do.
* * *
- Oh are you serious? Clean this up immediately!
- Yes sir, right away. Let me clean this up for you.
- Ah
- Holy cannoli! This head massage is the best thing since sliced bread.
- It brings me back to the good days when mom would lull me to sleep in the summertime after eating a fresh snack.
- All right. I've cleaned up the cream ma'am. I'm sorry for the ...
- You're fine. But rub my head again, won't you?
- Huh?
- That was the best massage ever. A minute, no a second will do
- Okay.
* * *
- Well, then... Thank you for the opportunity. Bye.
- You're not done. You have a second test. If you say this is really your dream, I'll give you one more chance.
- Thank you sir. Thank you so much.
- Oh, wow. This kid has really strong hands.
- Um. Since you failed that first test, don't mess up this time. The most important thing is a clean shop. Since the cream was your fault, you must clean it up.
- A cleaning test cup you bet. I had cleaning duty every time I came last in school.
- Oh great. I'm filled with confidence.
- What's that? Can't they see I just mopped this? I got this.
- Huh? what?
- This milk is really incompetent. You ...
- You poor little thing. You haven't used a mop before?
- You kids don't know how to work. I still do my son's laundry. Son, hand me that.
- Nah I got it.
- Here's how it's done. Go like this, front to back.
- Wow awesome. Thank you
- Seems this kid's got a way about him, no?
- Hmm, people think he's cute I guess I'll give him one more chance.
* * *
- Wilk, even after failing these two tests, there's one more chance.
- Master, thanks so much.
- Stop saying that. This test will determine whether or not you work here. This test is to make whipped cream.
- That's all I have to do? I can do that for sure. You know the main ingredient, don't you? Fresh milk right here.
- Pour into the bowl, add sugar and butter, and mix away just like that. Let's go.
* * *
- Uh? What's that?
- Check out that flying sign! What a creative way to advertise!
- I gotta show this to my friends.
- High above bakery town the flying billboard has captured everyone's attention. Their way of using a hand mixer to fly is such a clever thing to do. It's something we won't forget.
* * *
- Where is that kid? He's gonna pay for every cent of fixing my roof!
- Hey! That's the place!
- This is the famous bread barber shop right?
- Are you the owner?
- The flying billboard idea was super cool.
- Yeah now you do our hair.
* * *
- I'm so sorry Master Bread. I know I messed up, but I'll pay for your roof and stuff.
- Well, so glad you're back in one piece.
- That was the test, you passed it. You can start to work here right away.
- I ... really?
- I'll do whatever you ask of me. I'll work so hard, sir.
- Okay, I'm sure you will.
* * *
- Whoa, there it is again! the flying billboard.
- It gets better anytime I see it.
- Master, how much longer do I have to do this?
- Hang in there kid. Almost lunch break.
- You got it, master Bread.
