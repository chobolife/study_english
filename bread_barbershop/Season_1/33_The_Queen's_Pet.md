# The Queen's Pet

- What? Ten thousand for a bike?
- For ten thousand I better do all the pedaling for me.
- Oh, why is a trip to Hawaii so pricey?
- I need to lay on a beach. Is that so hard?
- Sausage. That tickles.
- Shocking news. The dog belonging to the queen of bakery town has suddenly gone missing.
- Huh? That's so sad our dog is missing.
- If you happen to see the queen's dog, please report it to the nearest police station.
- Whoa. Looks exactly like Sausage, right?
- Huh? Whoever returns the dog to the queen will receive... What? Is this even real? Ten thousand bucks, I gotta get in on this.
- Whoa? Ten thousands?
***
- Don't worry guys. There's no way Sausage is the queen's dog.
- Walk time. Time to go for a walk boy. We'll be back.
***
- Master Bread and Choco could both really use the money.
- What if they turn Sausage into the queen because he looks like her dog for the money?
- What a cute little guy?
- Sir, how old is your dog?
- Wow, good boy.
- Leave him alone.
- Huh?
- Don't even look at him. Sausage is not and never has been the queen's dog.
- That was weird.
- Probably expired.
***
- Huh. Finally we're safe.
- What is this? Everyone's staring at Sausage.
- It's too dangerous outside. Back to the shop. Hurry.
- Oh, mom, can I have a puppy like that one?
- I told you. Dad's allergic.
- Wow. I just saw like the cutest dog.
***
- It'll be safer to stay inside until the other dog is found.
- Sausage, food time.
- Something's different about his food. The smell has changed.
- It tastes different.
- Why on earth did you do that?
- You... you must have spiked his food with sleeping pills so you could turn him into the queen.
- Ah. He's on diet food. The vet said he was getting too chunky so he had to put him on this mix.
- Hmm. It's still suspicious.
- Huh? Sausage! Where is he? Sausage?
- You in here? Now's not the time for hide-and-seek.
- Sausage, where did you go?
***
- Why are you so loud?
- Sausage. I thought you were gone.
- Sir, why would you take him away without telling me first?
- All day I looked everywhere.
- Today is Sausage's bath day. What's wrong with giving him a bath?
- It's a very dangerous time for Sausage right now, okay? You can't just take him out.
- It's okay, you're safe buddy, who's my good boy.
- Is Wilk okay?
- He's always this weird, sir.
***
- Wilk, it's time to close up.
- Don't worry about me. You guys head home.
- I don't know.
- Well, I'm going home.
- And done. Ta-da. Look what I made. It's your new house.
- There you go. Cozy? You'll be safe in here.
- No one's gonna take you away from me.
- Don't worry. I'll guard you as long as it takes. You're worth more than reward money.
- I've gotta try and get some shut eye.
***
- Wilk! Were you down here all night?
- Morning, already?
- Huh? Where'd he go? Choco, have you seen Sausage?
- Not today.
- Sausage. Hello, are you here?
- Master Bread, have you seen Sausage anywhere?
- I haven't seen him yet. Why?
- Tell me. Did you give Sausage up for the reward?
- What are you talking about?
- Somebody took them away from me.
***
- Yeah son. I took myself.
- I'm ripped, son. I'm the queen's pooch now.
- You what?
- You peasants live and squalor and feed me the blandest, cheapest food, but I'm a prince.
- I'm the queen's pet now. I do what I want.
- I live in the palace and eat whatever my heart desires.
- Bye peasants. It's been real.
- You can't mean all that.
- Please come back. I'll buy you nice things.
- Let it go, sour milk. My new life's way better than this.
- Guess you can have this for your trouble?
- Get some new clothes.
- I thought we were friends.
- Why are you doing this to me?
- With you? I don't have any poor friends.
- This is just a place for me to crash for a while.
- Wilk, bye.
- Come back. Come back.
- Poor people are the worst.
- Come back.
***
- None... none of it is real?
- He's fine. What an unsettling dream.
- Surely there's another way to hide.
***
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
- That's hot dog. He sausage's uncle's brother's third cousin's daughter.
- He'll be living in the barbershop from now on.
- Huh?
- Looks an awful lot like Sausage. You said is his cousin's what?
- Yeah... don't worry about it. He's never been to our shop before.
- Yes. You know I noticed some resemblance to Sausage.
- Yeah, me, too.
- Phew. I am the smartest milk alive.
- Another shocking update.
- The queen has lost her beloved pet dog once again.
- Anyone who sees this dog is encouraged to report it at once.
- Oh, the reward is 20 grand?
- Move. That dog is mine.
- Not again!
