# Bread's Date

- Wilk, we're all done. Can you see the customer out?
- Sure thing.
- Thank you for coming by.
- Hey, is it too late to get a haircut?
- I'm sorry. We're actually closed right now.
- Never too late. Our shop is open to all, any time of day.
- Huh... Looks like it's gonna be a long night.
* * *
- Wilk.
- Choco?
- You look exhausted. Like you expired three years ago or something.
- You're right. We had to stay here all night yesterday.
- The entire night?
- It's been happening all week. Every single night we stay late.
- I want to go home. I just don't know why. We're supposed to close.
- Ah. What about if we get Master Bread a girlfriend?
- He'll want to leave work early if he's taking out a lady bread.
- A girlfriend?
* * *
- Master Bread?
- What is it now?
- Hey, you want to go on a blind date?
- Blind date? No, I don't have time for that stuff.
- I know the perfect girl for you, sir.
- She's pretty and kind and smart and funny, too.
- Customers are lining up outside the shop for me these days.
- Wasting my time on one person doesn't seem very profitable.
- But this friend has more friends. She could bring more customers to our store.
- Not many people match your handsomeness and intelligence, Master Bread.
- I bet the two of you would be like a Matcha Made in Heaven.
- I guess I could check my calendar.
* * *
- Are you Master Bread?
- Nice to meet you. My name is Tiramisu. This place is great.
- Oh sweet cannolis dipped that chocolate. What do I do?
* * *
- I wonder how Master Bread's date went.
- Just once I'd like to leave work on time.
- Good morning.
- So how'd the date go last night?
- The date? Splendid.
- In fact, we have plans to beat up again.
- We're going to watch grain man one of these days.
- Isn't it great?
- Yeah.
- I'm leaving early today. You guys should too.
- It worked. Awesome.
- Well. See you all tomorrow. Good night.
- See you tomorrow.
- Oh, yeah.
- Somebody seems excited to go home.
- I sure am. Thanks to you.
- I'm gonna go home and binge watch Donut Ranger Ninja Force.
* * *
- Master Bread!
- Tiramisu said she's sick and can't meet up with me today.
- Uh, I don't know why I even try to date anymore.
- There's always work.
- Wilk, you'll be here, right?
- Of course.
* * *
- See ya. I'm off to have dinner with Tiramisu. Night.
- Bye. Have a good time, sir.
- Huh?
- String cheese and I are gonna play video games.
- Huh? Back already?
- She told me she had to leave for a last-minute business trip.
- Oh, dating is tough. Might as well just work all night again.
- Huh. I used to have a social life.
* * *
- I'm finally meeting up with Tiramisu.
- Clean up and head home.
- Okay.
- They got cancelled. Let's get ready for more customers.
- Okay.
- It's back on.
- It's canceled.
- We're going out.
- She's busy.
* * *
- Hmm... Ah! What's going on with you?
- He keeps changing his plans. I'm at the end of my rope.
- It's even worse when I get excited and make plans, but then I still have to work late.
- Do... do you have any other good ideas?
- Hmm. Looks like he needs to make some moves.
- Ooh. Like what?
- Hey, listen here.
- We need to get him to talk...
* * *
- Sir?
- Huh?
- Question. What do you think of miss Tiramisu?
- It's a cake, lady fingers dipped in coffee.
- No, that's not what I meant. Plus, I heard Miss Tiramisu really likes you.
- Really? Hmm.
- What if you confessed your feelings to her?
- Confess?
- Be honest with her and make your intentions known.
- Love don't come easy, you know.
- Okay, sounds good. But how do I do that? Any ideas?
- Easy. Start off with a nice bouquet of flowers and bring jewelry, too.
- Jewelry can't go wrong. It'll be great.
* * *
- Who are you?
- Uh, I thought Tiramisu would be here.
- This is Tiramisu's house, right?
- You're looking for her?
- Hey, mom. someone at the door is looking for you.
- Mom? ugh...
- It's some crusty old toast.
- I'm just a side dish?
- It's not funny when you call your auntie that.
- But didn't you say someone was waiting here? I don't see anyone.
- The weird old man said something about being a side dish and ran off.
- Oh, kid, you always have the oddest pranks.
* * *
- Master Bread, cheer up. It's not you.
- Wilk, I've made up my mind.
- Huh? on what?
- I'm married to my job.
- You... You don't say.
* * *
- Left, a little left, and your other left.
- No that's two left now. Easy now.
- Steady there. Ah. You see there? Lower there.
- All I wanted was to go home early.
