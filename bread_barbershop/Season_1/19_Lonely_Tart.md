# Lonely Tart

- Hello, ladies and gentlebreads. Welcome to the greatest makeover show, Master Patissier!
- What are you slackers watching this time?
- Master Bread, have you heard of this show before?
- Master Patissier gathers top hairdressers and brings them on to transform people's lives.
- Hmm, all Silas look average at best.
- By the way, you've got mail from the TV station here.
- We cordially invite you to appear on Master Patissier?
- Wow, appear on the show? We gotta do it, okay?
- We don't have time. We're better off making money in the shop.
- All our fabulous hairdressers are awarded with a new sports car.
- Choco, clear my schedule. Where do I need to go to do this thing?
- Says you need to be at the broadcast studio next Tuesday at noon.
- Um, would be rude of me to reject this invitation?
- Whoa, this means you're gonna go? Sausage, we need to make a sign to cheer him on.

- Shocking transformations, tear-jerking real-life stories. I'm your host Croissant. Welcome to the world's best makeover show, Master Patissier!
- So most tarts have fillings like they're supposed to. But what happens when one is born empty inside? Please welcome on stage, Tart!
* * *
- Tell us. What's wrong?
- I don't have any custard.
- Lord! A tart with no custard cream? You sure it's true?
- Right, Scott! A tart with no custard filling can't even be called the tart at all.
- You think you'd use whipped cream or some other alternative.
- It's been like this since I was born.
* * *
- Huh? There's nothing in this one. I can't put this one out.
- Those look delicious and that fruit topping.
- Oh, like tiny little pies.
* * *
- Poor kid.
- I only want to live like a normal dessert.
- My heart aches for this poor kid who just wants to be like other tarts.
- But don't worry, it's what I do.
- We and Master Patissier have found the best barber in bakery town and brought him in to grab your wish.
- No gain without grain, it's Master Bread.
- Master Bread! Master Bread!

- Master Bread, have you prepared a miracle to turn this tart's life around?
- A piece of cake. I'll start with homemade custard cream piling it gently on here. And top it off with strawberry slices, you look fine fresh and fruity.
- Wow, and now without further ado, let's start.

- First he begins by preparing the custard filling.
- Just look at that technique folks, a veteran for sure.
- And just like that he's got a head full of sweetness.
- Now time to touch up. No, I can hardly handle the drama.
- Amazing. He really is the best stylist in the world.
- So cool. Slice like a ninja.
- His moves are all exciting.
* * *
- Wow.
- Oh, my crust. Genius! This is why we're here, to see incredible transformations like this.
- And now, bring down the mirror.
- Think it's good?
- Yeah, looks great, sir.
- Tart loves his makeover, but there's one more surprise we brought for you. Please welcome George brothers.
* * *
- You're our brother. You know we always got your back.
- Holy waffles.
- Oh, Jesus.
- That's just for me?
- What a shocking twist! Tart's brothers have forgone their filling, too.
- This isn't who I am. Thank you.
- Are you kidding? I worked hard on that.
- We know it hasn't been easy.
- We'll always be here.
- All those custom cream ingredients aren't cheap.
- Master Bread, this means you can't have the sports car, but better luck next time.
- What? You know how hard I work on the design for that stupid kid.
- Haha. Master Bread is just getting emotional too.
- Good night and we'll see you all next time.
* * *
- Ooh boss, looks like another letter from Master Patissier.
- I want nothing to do with that show.
- We'd love to have you on our show again. The ratings were through the roof.
- I bet you won't be back. You stay alone, Croissant.
- Choco, look after the shop.
- Stupid show thing.
- Oh yeah good job.
- Guys.
