# My Love, Choco

- That's real good.
- Master Bread. My friend's in town. He wanted to come see where I worked.
- Nice to meet you. My name's Milk Toast.
- Oh, is he your friend from dairy academy?
- I've heard so much about you, Master Bread. Like that you're the most amazing hair stylist bread ever.
- What an honor to meet you in real life.
- Well, I'm just regular toast.
- No, you're not, sir. This entire shop is great like you.
- Ah. Look at all these trophies. There's so many.
- Wanna know his record? It's seven years in a row.
- Those silly old things.
- Hey, bread man! Quick taking diet dumps! The toilet's clogged.
- Hmm...
* * *
- Wilk. Who is that gorgeous woman?
- Choco? The angry one?
- Ah, Choco. How sweet is thy name, my dear Choco.
- Wilk, you must introduce me to her.
- Please, please, please, please. I'll do anything for her.
* * *
- Hmm.
- Hey, Choco. You got a sec?
- What?
- What did you think of my friend I brought today? Milk Toast. Did you think he was nice?
- That pale bread? Why?
- I was wondering if you wanted to go on a date.
- With...
- Uh, with Milk Toast. He's real nice and popular with girls.
- No.
- But... but, why?
- Hmm. Not my type.
- I understand.
* * *
- Huh? Wilk. What did she say?
- She...
- Hang on. Did she say she wants to meet tonight? Only to find an outfit.
- She said that you're not her type.
- I don't know why you are not her type.
- Maybe she likes someone who's more muscular and tan.
- This can't be. I was already envisioning the kind of wedding we'd have.
- Don't cry. There's other cakes out there.
- No. I have to become the kind of guy she likes.
- Huh?
- I'll start working out right now, and become strong and tan for her.
- Wilk, I gotta go find some weights to lift. See you later.
- Wait! Milk Toast.
- Choco, this is for you.
* * *
- Oh, yeah. Do I look handsome yet?
- Wow, Milk Toast. Your muscles look great. Choco will definitely notice this.
- No. I'm not there yet.
- Huh?
- Working out is one thing.
- But I'm still super pale. I was born of fair bread with only a light toasting on my sides.
- Was Choco supposed to like me like this?
- He wanna brown... I think Master Bread might be able to help.
- Yeah. After all, he is a genius.
* * *
- Hmm... You're interested in Choco, aren't you? Don't care. So you want to be tan?
- Yes. If I'm tan, I'll be able to win her heart for sure. But do you think it's possible?
- Anything's possible. Wilk, get the tanning bed out of storage.
- You got it.
* * *
- Wow. This is a tanning bed?
- Yep. It's a special model made for bread. Back in my day, I toasted myself a time or two.
- Be warned. it gets a little hot.
- Okay.
- Hey, you didn't say it would be quite this hot. Can't you turn it down a little?
- Don't complain. You want to be tanned, don't you? Beauty is pain.
- But it feels like there's an actual fire.
- Stay strong, friend. Do it for Choco, come on.
- Oh, you're right.
- Do it for love. Get that tan.
* * *
- Well done. This begins your life as a well-done toast.
- Thank you, sir.
- I'm a whole new bread.
- Extra crunchy.
- Wow, Milk Toast, you look great.
- Thank you so much, Master Bread. Everything they say about you is true. It's also true.
- Yes. Now go in her heart, son.
- Thank you, sir.
* * *
- See you tomorrow.
- Miss Choco.
- Huh?
- Hey, what's new? It's me. Milk Toast has a whole new look now. You like it?
- Oh yeah. How are you?
- I... I... uh... Here.
- Flowers?
- Please. From the moment I saw you, you have won my heart.
- Nah. Sorry guy. I'm not interested in you.
- But, why? Just look. I worked so hard to get all these gains for you, and burnt to a crisp for you.
- Oh... That doesn't really matter to me.
- Then... Why? What have I done?
- It's you just look too much like my boss. That's all.
- What... you... I don't... I don't think I do. What part of me looks anything like that crusty old bread, huh?
- We're different look. I'm like 20 shades darker.
- See you later.
- Choco...
- That's like going on a date with Master Bread. So gross.
* * *
- Hey, what happened? Why are you so sad? Did your request to Choco not go as planned?
- Cheer up. There's plenty of cakes on the shelf. It's a big bakery out there.
