# The Dark Wilk Rises

- Donut Ranger!
- Foolish donut. Time's up for you. Dirty dog power!
- Huh? What? What's happened? Could it be the dark devil dog's curse?
***
- Sounds good, Choco. One new mirror should do.
- Where's Wilk? Hard for him to be so late.
- Wilk, don't you know what time it is? Huh?
- I can read a clock old man. I just don't care.
- Oh, man. Having to come to work is stupid.
- Bread, go get me a snack.
- Excuse you?
- Didn't you hear me? I want a snack.
- What is happening to this kid?
***
- Wilk, I hope this will. Oh?
- Wait. Where is he? Huh?
- Wilk.
- Ah.
- How are you dusting that frame? Good to see you're back to your... Oh!
- Wilk. Why would you do that?
- I think you should match the picture.
- Stop. Stop it.
- That's an improvement on your ugly old face.
- Oh, old man. You need a finishing touch.
***
- Somebody save me.
- Stop at once, my child.
- When someone has a problem, they only need to ask and they shall receive.
- You have to help me. I don't know what's going on.
- I see. He's being controlled by farce is quite dark.
- The forces? What do we do?
- I've seen this before.
- No dark forces can withstand this perfectly distilled water.
- The power of cross compulsion. The power of cross compulsion.
- Leave this poor milk carton alone. Forever.
- How do you like the taste of dark evil forses?
- That water's boring. Don't you have soda?
- You old people have boring snacks.
- I've never dealt with dark spirits as strong.
- What do we do now?
***
- I thought I'd found inner peace, but it's time to kick some buns.
- Oh, please. Do something about this kid. He's a monster.
- Never fear my child.
- The power of steamed pork will put this boy back into shape.
- Oh, yeah? At least I have a shape. You're just round.
- Ah the evil is strong in this one, but he'll be no match for my mystical powers of many small dishes.
- While bacon chive pancake. While bacon chive pancake.
- While bacon chive pancake. While bacon chive pancake.
***
- How did he think that would work?
- Step aside, rookies.
- The problem is they're all too sweet.
- Hey yeah.
- Who are you?
- Who am I you ask?
- I am great grandma morning bun salty from too many years and too much salt.
- Beware dark spirits. I'm about to knock the stuffing out of you.
- Be gone nasty your milk. Be gone nasty your milk.
- Come on. This is annoying.
- You insolent brat. I'll knock those evil spirits out of ya yet.
***
- Sounds great. Let's speed things up.
- Oh, I hurt my back.
- Are you alright?
- That was fun and you ruined it not cool.
- Come on. Let's go for another round.
- Such evil he delights in the suffering of others.
- He's strong. Too strong for us.
- We must unite our powers.
- In the name of cheese and crust.
- Buns of pea stone.
- And the salt of savory bread.
- Now we are one. Bakery spirits. Unite.
- How'd you like that, spirit?
- Leave this poor young milk, right now states.
- I don't like this.
- I'm back, guys. Phew. It's bright in here.
***
- Master Bread! What on earth is going on in here? Why are there elderly customers on the floor?
- Choco, Wilk is possessed.
- Huh?
- Oh, not again.
- This kid stinks. Disgusting.
- Can't you smell? He's gone sour.
- There we go. Now that he's filled up with fresh milk, he should be back to normal.
- What happened to him?
- Do you live under a rock or something? Yesterday all the power went out.
- Wilk probably keeps his house really cold.
- When the power went out, his insides went all bad.
***
- Good morning. What time is it?
- Huh?
- Wilk, how are you feeling?
- I'm so awesome. Thanks, sir. How are you?
- Welcome friends. How can we help you today?
- Come back here. You dropped your thingamajig.
- Uh, that was weird.
