# Bread's Birthday

- Choco, is tomorrow a big day?
- Ah, no. Just Master Bread's birthday thing.
- What? I don't... His birthday?
- Yeah. He circles his own birthday on the calendar every year.
- Why didn't you tell me? This is super important.
- Uh. And why is that?
- Think about it. Master Bread has no family, no friends. Cause he always works.
- So he's gonna be all alone by himself on Sunday.
- What kind of birthday is that?
- Huh?
- We need to go celebrate with him.
- You mean like go to his house?
- Hmm. I'll give him the best birthday of all time.
- All right. Here we go. Operation best birthday ever.
***
- Candle, check. Match, check. Man, he's gonna be so surprised.
- Chocolate cream pies I got for my birthday. So good.
- It's fine. Master Bread would like them more.
- But what should I give him as a gift?
- Ew. My favorite Red Donut Ranger action figure I waited in line for. It's limited edition.
- It's been fun Bread. Master Bread will give you a good home.
- All right. Ready to go. This is gonna be the best birthday ever.

- House number 221. 221...
- We should be getting close. Ah right there.
- He lives in here?
- His house... I can't believe he lives in a shack like this.
- It's because he spends all the shops money on our salaries.
- We are not worthy of you.
- Wilk, it's not bad.
- Hey, keep it down out there, you folks. I'm trying to get some sleep.
- Um, excuse me. Does Master Bread live here?
- Who's that?
- The barber...
- Do I look like I know? Leave me alone. Sheesh.
- I don't understand.
- Wilk, this shack doesn't have a number.
- We're looking for 221 which is... that one.
- The giant one?
- Yep. Don't worry about him, not being well off. He's doing pretty good.
- That's good then. I'm glad. But still what's the point of having a big place?
- If no one comes over like friends or family?
- The poor man must be so lonely on his birthday. It makes me so sad.
- Well, don't worry. Wilk's on his way to be our friend.
- I hope we're not too late this year.
- I heard that last year 5 p.m. was the cutoff.
- I'm so excited to give him this present.
- What's going on?
- These are all the customers whose lives have been made better by Master Bread's work.
- Look at him. Looks like he spent the night here.
- He spent the night on the street just to give his present to Master Bread?
- Wilk, we should join the line. Otherwise, we won't get in.
- Maybe it'll be a shorter line than last year's.
***
- Hey, what'd you get in this year? It looks nice.
- Well, it's better than last year's.
- Choco, did you get him anything?
- No. With everything he gets, he'd never notice.
- Okay.
***
- Now that you've given your gift, can we leave?
- What? no way. what's the point of getting all these nice presents unless you blow out birthday candles on a cake?
- I brought an extra tasty one. Ta-da.
***
- Her majesty the queen of bakery town sends her special buffet over.
- The queen never forgets Master Bread's birthday since he does her hair.
- What a lucky man to receive the royal birthday banquet!
- I hope he likes it. I hear he's a picky eater.
***
- Wilk you've done well. Let's go.
- No way. I have to stay. What if he's feeling lonely? We should go spend time together.
- I'm coming Master Bread.
***
- Wow.
- Yes, solo slice is the way to be.
- Wilk, Master Bread is great at being alone.
- He holds the bakery world record for a high score in solitaire.
- So stop worrying about his birthday, you know?
- You're right. I get it.
- Master Bread doesn't need me to give him a present or a cake.
- You two? what's up?
- It's just...
- Wilk wanted to make sure your birthday was a special one.
- Ah so kind of you, but it really isn't necessary, but nice of you to try.
- Be sure to grab some food on your way out.
***
- See? You don't have to worry about him next time.
- I'm hungry. Let's see what the queen has sent me this time.
- Lobster, chicken... Nothing that fun.
- The chocolate cream pie I used to eat as a kid.
- Hmm. Now that's what I call food.
- Let's see what presents I got this year.
- Hmm. I don't even wear a watch.
- It's the same one I have. Not my style. Already have it. It's all just stuff.
- This box looks like it's had better days.
- What? It couldn't be! The limited edition Red Donut Ranger?
- Super rare and hard to find.
- Money couldn't buy anything like this.
- Who would give me something so nice?
- This is the best birthday ever.
