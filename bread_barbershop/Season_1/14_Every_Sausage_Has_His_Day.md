# Every Sausage Has His Day

- Sausage, what do you want?
- I'm busy. Don't you have buns to sniff?
- Not right now, Sausage. I'll play with you later, okay?
- No one cared enough to feed you today. Eat up little buddy.
- By the way, shouldn't someone walk him around the neighborhood?
- Can't you see I'm busy? Ask Wilk. He'll do it.
- Uh... I'm too busy too though. Choco, can't you do it today?
- Ugh, picking up the slack. Sausage, wanna go on a walk?
- Don't take it personally. Things have been busy at the shop these days.
- They should take better care of their dog. I'm sure we can make them step up.

- Greetings. Can an old really steamed bun rest his feet here for a moment?
- Of course sir. Can I get a drink for you?
- Oh! I see it all.
- See what now?
- You broke your milk carton when you were a young lad.
- Milk splattered all over the place. Your parents were beside themselves. I see it all, crying over the spilt milk.
- Yes, it's all true. You knew, but how did you know?
- I know everything.

- What do you see in Master Bread? Anything embarrassing?
- The past is long. I see a stage.
- Oh, what?
- Oh. The shine of the spotlight is blinding. I hear an audience erupting in applause.
- Oh.
- Wow, how did you know Master Bread was an actor when he was young?
- Master steamed bun's powers are limitless. He predicts not only people's pasts, but their futures too.
- Even the queen of bakery town has used his services before. Not to mention his guest star appearance on carbs of our lives.
- I see something else now. Something incredible. It's the future of this dog and who owns him.
- What about him?
- The one who cares for this dog will live in the Tower Palace.
- Tower Palace?
- None other than the royal house, a garage of a thousand cars, steaks and lobsters every night, limitless riches are awaiting you.
- Sausage's owner?
- Could it be true?
- I see it all. None are lies.
- Come boy. Dinner time.

- No way. He can't eat that. Sausage deserves better food than this.
- He's always had this.
- No. Sausage deserves the highest quality stuff, delicious beef jerky.
- Come here little friend. And I think they're organic too.
- Sausage, where are you going?
- Oh, you're here friend. I've made a perfect rib eye steak just for you buddy.
- But wait! Sausage was about to eat the food that I got for him.
- He doesn't want that chunk. Jerky would upset his stomach.
- Go on, eat. It's all just for you.

- Sausage. You wanna go for a walk? Tada. It's your new harness.
- To protect your tender little feet, ah the new airborne shoes!
- What are you trying to do? You didn't even consider that sausage could sprain an ankle on a walk.
- But he needs his daily exercise.
- Tada. A pet stroller for my best little guy.
- Time to go. What part of the neighborhood do you like the best?
- That was fun. After the exercise, do you want to take a bath?
- Look, boy. A pet jacuzzi bath. It costs three months of my salary, but it's worth it for my favorite dog.
* * *
- Don't tell me you're about to bathe this dog in that bucket you call a bath.
- Don't worry. Papa's got you.
- Where are you taking it Master Bread?
- See? Better.
- What in the world?
- A Japanese-style hot spring, only for Sausage to use. Who takes good care of you? Master Bread.

- Hmm... Greetings friends, just an old bun passing by.
- Mr bun, look. I'm taking great care of him. Sausage you're mine, right?
- That's just not true. Sausage is mine.
- No I brought him home. That makes him my dog.
- No. He lives in my shop.
* * *
- They really needed that kick in the pants to step up and take care of their dog.
- Sure, anytime. I'm just doing my job of course.
- Here, as we discussed.
- Pleasure doing business with you. See you around.
- Mm-hmm.
