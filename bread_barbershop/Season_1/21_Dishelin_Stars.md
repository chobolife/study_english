# Dishelin Stars

- I'm done for. It's all over. I do.
- Are you okay? What's wrong?
- I got a zero star review from Dishelin. And now I have to shut down.
- What's Dishelin?
- Only the fanciest review magazine ever. If Dishelin gives you a bad review, your business is over. Just like me.
- Oh, no. Please don't cry, please.
- I heard he's going to go after Bread Barbershop.
- So be prepared. If he gets a bad review, he'll have to close down.
- He can't close.
* * *
- Master bread! There you are.
- Why are you yelling before 10 A.M.?
- I heard Dishelin is going to come to our shop.
- It's time. He's finally come.
- But I still don't understand who this Dishelin is.
- Just the finest hair styling magazine of all time.
- Three stars has the highest honor a hair salon can be awarded.
- However, most get zero. And end up losing all their customers.
- Choco, I need you to find out exactly when this muffin is coming to our shop.
- It says he usually drops by unannounced, but he tends to come in Wednesdays at noon.
- Isn't today a Wednesday? Wednesday the 13th. That's almost as bad as a Friday.
* * *
- So this is the Bread Barber? Let's just hope he lives up to all the good things I've heard. Now's a good time as any.
- Excuse me.
* * *
- Master Bread, are you okay? You seem to be twitchy.
- Well, I'm fine. Only a fool would be nervous today.
- Uh?
- Hey, excuse me.
- Could this be Dishelin?
- Of course, he'd come in disguise. Very clever. Only something the top critic would pull off.
- Fine. Let the games begin.
* * *
- Welcome, sir.
- Won't you please sit down?
- Wilk, do serve our customer a cold drink, won't you?
- Yup. Coming right up.
- Hmm, I'm here for a haircut. Is Master Bread in?
- Shh. He's working on someone important. Have a seat and he'll be with you.
- Okay.
* * *
- Well, let's see what we're working with today.
- This is appalling. What on earth am I supposed to do with this horrifying mess?
- Truly a test to prove my worth.
- Master Bread, are you sure you got this?
- Please. I was born to get three stars.
- Wow, he can even read my expressions.
* * *
- Master Bread, aren't you wasting a lot of time doing that all bit by bit?
- Art cannot be defined by speed and if I go quickly it might be uncomfortable.
- Oh, such care he gives.
* * *
- And done.
- Wow, awesome. He looks so clean and shiny now.
- It's time for the next phase.
- My word it's 5 P.M. already? Hey, are you gonna finish anytime soon? It's almost time for your shop to close.
- No, this takes time. I haven't even really started yet.
- Oh, come on. What is the point of all this? He's just another old hobo.
- What's the point? What did you call him?
- With these scissors, everyone is equal. It doesn't matter who you are.
- I'm impressed by his noble intentions. He inspires us all to be more kind.
* * *
- Amazing. He's an entirely new person now.
- Yes, you transformed another one.
- Ah, it's just another Wednesday. I am always this great.
- I can't believe it. Is this even the same man who came in before?
- He put in so much effort and asked for nothing in return.
- Well, now that that's done, I'll give my next amazing makeover.
- Just have a seat.
- No, I've seen everything I need, Bread.
- You reminded me there's goodness in everyone. You've taught me much today.
- Thank you all so much. So very much.
- Sir, you dropped something.
- Master Bread. We messed up.
- What? What the buns? Hang on. Then who's this?
* * *
- Tonight I experienced something truly extraordinary at the Bread Barbershop.
* * *
- Tell me. Who in the croissant are you?
- I live under the bridge.
* * *
- He puts a great amount of effort into every head of hair. No matter if the customer is rich or poor.
* * *
- So why did you come in here?
- To use your bathroom.
- Then why didn't you say that?
- Cause you told me to sit down here. I still needed to go so I used your floor.
* * *
- Though the decor may be modest, the craftsmanship found here is unparalleled anywhere else.
* * *
- You made me lose an important customer. You'd better be able to pay.
- Why should I pay? I didn't even ask for this.
- Master Bread, please calm down.
* * *
- Surely Master Bread is the finest barber in all of bakery town.
- Never before have I been so certain of bestowing these stars.
- One, two, three.
