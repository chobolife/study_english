# A Home for Wilk

- I feel almost curdled after that long day. Time for sleep.
- Huh? Hello?
- Oh, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
- Uh, landlady bread. What's the matter? I could have sworn I paid rent this month.
- Well, it is related to that. Things are getting expensive these days, young man. The price of real estate just goes up, you know. That's why your rent has to go up again.
- What? That's not fun when my salary stays the same. How much is the rent going up?
- Not very much at all. Just a thousand dollars.
- What? A thousand who?
- You should be grateful I'm not doubling it like other landlords.
- But then I'm afraid that's just too much money for me to pay you.
- My word. How do you expect me to keep up with today's economy? Get it together.
- But I... I can't afford to live here.
- So... move somewhere else. It's no difference to me.
- But... Wait! Please! Landlady!
- Can't hear the sounds of whining.
* * *
- One thousand... One thousand dollars more?
- I get paid 1,500. After rent, food, city bus, bills, and anything fun like donut ranger movies and everything else I gotta pay, I barely get by.
- But another thousand? No. Even I know that math doesn't work. Oh no. This is bad. I'm done for.
- Wilk, What's up?
- Choco.
- Who beat you up?
- My rent's going up. She said a thousand dollars increase.
- A thousand? You sure she didn't say a hundred?
- It's true. She said a thousand bucks for sure. Where will I find that money?
- Why not just move to a new place? I'm sure you can find someplace cheaper around.
- My place... So full of unforgettable memories I want to cherish.
- So silly. You know memories won't keep food on the table, right?
- I guess I really have to move.

- Hello sir. Welcome to half-baked realty for all your moving needs. Now how can I be of help to you?
- I need a new home. Someplace cheap but with a barbecue and a pool.
- No, you're asking far too much. You can only pick one, cheap or good.
- Is that so?
- However, I'm sure we can find something that works for your needs. There's one on the market that's both cheap and good.
* * *
- Tada! Here it is. Your home.
- Wow. Huh? But I thought you said this place was good.
- That's true. The bathroom's a quarter mile from the bedroom, great for exercise. Exercise is good, so this house is definitely good.
- I don't know. You and I might have different definitions of the word 'good'. This just won't work. Do you have anything else?
* * *
- The next one is cheap and also great. There's just one little flaw.
- Is this another version of good?
- No. It's just a little far away.
- Oh, that's not bad at all. I'll just leave for work earlier.
* * *
- Mr. Wilk. We're almost there.
- Great and how soon?
- Yeah, just another four or five hours left to go.
- Four hours? But we've already been driving for four hours already. Is this place in a whole different town?
- It's still in bakery town. It's the outer suburbs. Living out in the country might be good for you.
- Huh? Bring me back to the city. I'm not ready to be put on the pasture.
* * *
- So which definition of good is this one?
- Very good. I guarantee you're gonna like this next house. Here's the place. It's right in town and it's cheap.
- Oh, super good. Let's check it out.
- Holy butterscotch. This is awesome.
- I gotta take a call real quick. You take your time looking around.
- Wow. It's clean, so much room. It's perfect. This is the one.
- Hey there. Are you here to look around the house?
- Yeah. Are you the owner? This place is so cool.
- Cool. Have a look around.
- Uh, hang on. Wilk here.
- How's it going? Forgot to tell you one tiny detail. The teensy problem with the place.
- Problem? It's super. Plus, I'm at the landlord.
- Ah, yeah. There is no landlord.
- Huh?
- That place has been haunted for years. The ghosts like to pretend to be your landlord.
* * *
- I'll never have a home. So many places... but none for a broke milk carton.
- Please don't be sad, Wilk. I know we can find you a home with a good positive mindset.
- Easy for you. You're not the one without a home. Each house is either weird, haunted, or a million miles out.
- Well, there is still one more place we haven't seen yet.
- Yeah?
- It's uh... listed as unique which we can work around. But I guess it couldn't hurt to take a look.
- Well, let's head inside. After you.
* * *
- Yes I know. The location is right in the middle of town which is why it's so small. I shouldn't have even brought you. We can go somewhere else.
- This is it. This is the place I've been waiting for.
- It's so convenient too. Wake up here. Wash my face here, brush my teeth, take a poop, and then clean up, another doodoo then go to sleep.
- Ah everything all at once. You should have shown me this house before all the other ones. What does it cost?
- It's uh, 500 a month.
- 500? Yay I'm in! I want to sign right now.
* * *
- That long search paid off in the end.
- This new house is just right for a little milk box.
- Hey there my house, I'm Wilk, your new friend. Can't wait to live in here.
