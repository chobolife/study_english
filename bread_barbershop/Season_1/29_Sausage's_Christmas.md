# Sausage's Christmas

- Cheese! Want to watch Donut Rangers?
- That's right. The Christmas special comes out tonight. See you then.
- Master Bread! I bet you have fun Christmas plans?
- Me? I'm going to the Barber Association party.
- Wow. Barbers association? I bet it's only the best barbers in the entire world.
- No hardly. After all they invited potato chip.
- Hmm... What should I bring?
- Maybe this premium juice that potato chip definitely couldn't afford.
- Everything is the worst.
- Huh? Choco, what's wrong?
- I have a party Christmas day and I need a new dress but all of these are ugly.
- Don't worry about a dress. When you're naturally handsome like me, it doesn't matter what you wear.
- Ah, why didn't I think of that?
- Sausage! What are you doing on Christmas day?
- Oh, right. You live here in the shop by yourself. So you'll be all alone that day. Sounds really boring and sad.
* * *
- Well I'm headed out. Happy holidays everyone.
- Bye. Sausage, you be a good boy.
- See you later Sausage. Don't forget to eat your kibble.
* * *
- Anyone home? I think you can do an old man a favor and open the door.
- What a cute little guy. I'm Santa Creambread.
- My Gingerbread Reindeer has broken its leg.
- Might you happen to have a bandage?
* * *
- I can't thank you enough. You're too kind.
- But he should really stay off that leg. I don't think he should be pulling my slate tonight at all.
- What should I do? There are so many presents left to give out.
- All the children will cry in despair when they're left forgotten and they'll ask their parents what did I do to deserve such a terrible Christmas?
- You sure? Pulling a sleigh won't be easy for a little pup you know.
- What a kind and selfless little pup!
- Be careful. It's the only sleigh I have.
- It's novelty ketchup that glows in the dark. Kids love it and it'll help light the way.
- Well, you're ready little guy?
* * *
- This one's name is Bread. He cuts hair or something and the print is really small.
- I hope he likes these dollar store scissors I picked up.
- Wow, I guess he uses the fancy stuff only. What am I supposed to give him now?
- Oh, if Bread really wants grape juice, I suppose he can have it.
* * *
- Young Choco would definitely love this soft teddy bear.
- Hmm... So you say she prefers fashion to cute cuddly plush toys?
* * *
- Wilk White, huh? A kind-hearted boy but not quite the brightest bun in the bakery.
- Maybe this world encyclopedia will help you out.
- Oh, so Wilk would prefer a Donut Ranger DVD to a nice book woody.
- Thanks for letting me know.
* * *
- I'm glad to see you're well. I think you can fly us home.
- Sausage, because of you I was able to get all the presents to their rightful owners on time.
- And for all your help I'll grant you one wish. What's the one thing you want for Christmas?
- Is that really the one thing you want? All right. Consider it done.
* * *
- Look what I got! Hey cheese, guess what I got for Christmas. The new Donut Ranger box set.
- That's so awesome. Just what you wanted, right?
- That's right. Usually I just get books.
- But where should we watch it today?
- Oh yeah. Sausage is all alone at the shop. Cheese, you want to watch it at my job?
- Sounds good let's go.
* * *
- Sausage!
- Merry Christmas. Choco, what brings you here?
- Sausage was all alone... I don't know. The party was canceled and I was bored and stuff.
- And you? Why are you guys here?
- I was worried Sausage was lonely, so we came to watch a movie with him.
- Now I'm here boys. Why is everyone at work?
- Sausage was here alone, so we came too.
- Master Bread, why are you here?
- There's a tax form or something.
- What are you holding over there Wilk?
- Oh so cool. A DVD of Donut Ranger. Let's watch it together.
- There's cookies here, not that I care.
- I suppose we could share this juice.
- Hey, you're being real generous. That isn't like you.
- Ah! You! How dare you insult me! You stinky little cheese! Why you, little!
* * *
- Donuts Rangers!
- What a great day you know?
- Christmas together at the barbershop like this.
- I know it is unusual.
- Well sir, my Christmas wish is to spend the holiday with Wilk and Master Bread and Choco, too.
- Is that really the one thing you want? All right. Consider it done.
- I know but I don't care. I'm having a great day with my favorite people.
- Oh, let's do a toast.
- To a merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
