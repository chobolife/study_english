# Soccer King Bread

- It's time to get serious about soccer.
- If you have what it takes, come on down. Bakery Soccer Team.
* * *
- Choco, did Wilk turn sour again? What's he doing?
- The Bakery town soccer team is having tryouts and he wants to give it a shot.
- Soccer? Wilk plays soccer?
- Huh? Master Bread. Good morning.
- Wilk, your dreams are so cute. At least let me teach you a thing or two before the tryouts.
- Whoa. Master Bread, you're good at soccer?
- Ah. A long time ago I was quite the bread to watch on my soccer team.
- Wow, tell me more.
- Even though my life head was set, the coach saw how amazing I was and wouldn't let me be.
* * *
- It was national finals and I had promised to play for them.
- We were behind by 10 points. The team had given up.
- Morale was low. But as soon as I walked on the field everyone knew things would turn around.
- The opposing team tried every dirty trick in the book, but they were no match for me.
* * *
- Even with my injury, I knew I couldn't let my team down.
- I went back on that field.
* * *
- We did it. I won enough points to beat them by just a little.
- Ah, that's the game. You give every ounce of who you are in order to win.
- Ah that's amazing sir. Really. Teach me how to be good at soccer, please.
- Wilk, playing sports is more than just a game, it's about giving all you've got.
- With me as your coach I can make you good.
- Yes master. I'm ready to learn.
* * *
- Huh? Why are those two late today? Huh?
- What is going?
- Cool, right? Like it? This is what a real soccer player and his coach look like.
- Oh, one thing. Wilk, do you have enough money to afford...
- Oh, hush. Choco, you gotta spend money before you could make it.
- How am I supposed to be the best soccer player without the best gear?
* * *
- Goal!
- Yeah!
- Let me hear you. Yell like you've won!
- Great. That's a victory dance.
- Wilk, that'll only happen if you score a goal. Shouldn't you practice the game, kicking, passing?
- Choco shows how much you know about sports.
- The victory dance is the backbone.
- Yeah. Choco's never seen a game. She doesn't understand it like we do.
- Wilk, now practice giving me a hug after you win the game.
- Yeah.
* * *
- You're done, you're done. Get off my field.
- Why is everyone so bad? I haven't found a single good player.
- Oh, are those the newest men's soccer clothes?
- Huh, that are those limited edition Air Fryer Jordans?
- And the David Beckham sweat headband?
- They're big time. They know what's up.
- Why am I even here right now?
- You two. Have you come to try out for soccer?
- Bingo. Though a tryout's not really necessary.
- We'll start the test right now. Let's go.
- Just show me your pass first.
- Wilk, do your best. Make me proud.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, let's play.
- That couldn't go more wrong. I don't suppose you can play.
- Ah, if you want something done right, do it yourself.
- I don't care. Just pass me the ball.
- Fine, but I'm warning you I'm pretty good. ah!
- Is that...? No way.
- Falcon kick!
- The legendary falcon kick, it's true.
* * *
- There goes my Saturday.
- That's it. I'm done. I'm never teaching soccer again.
- Hey lady, pass me that ball over there, will ya?
- Huh?
- You know how to do the legendary fireworks shot?
- Hey, where have you been hiding all this time?
- Huh?
- Bakery town soccer team needs someone of your caliber.
- Won't you consider joining our team?
- You could even play for the National League.
- Let's go sign some forms, and we can start training right away.
- That's the pay.
* * *
- Oh, just incredible.
- Wilk, did I tell you about the time I won against the whole team of Japan?
- I'm sure it was great, though.
- That's it. I've never seen someone play as well as you ever.
