# Tea Master

- Until next time.
- Uh
- Another job well done. Wilk, one cup of black tea please.
- Yep.
- Oh, there are so many types of tea.
- Which one does he want? This one? This one?
- It's all the same, right? They're all just leaves anyway. Release and water in a pot.
- One black tea, Master Bread.
- Thanks.
- Wilk, this is green tea, not black tea.
- Huh? So it's wrong?
- You can't tell the difference between greed and black?
- Try it yourself.
- But all teas taste the same to me.
* * *
- See you tomorrow.
- Have a good night, Master Bread.
- Hey choco, are green tea and black tea the same?
- Of course not. Why?
- When Master Bread asked for black tea, I made him green tea instead and he got all mad.
- I thought they were all the same.
- You don't know anything, do you kid?
- Tea is a part of our history.
- In ancient times, a sticky rice cake brewed the best tea.
- He served this tea to the king. It was so good he made that sticky rice cake the prime minister.
- So making tea is ingrained in bakery town.
- Whoa. So if I make good tea, master bread will make me prime minister or something?
- Uh... Worth a shot.
- Yeah. I'm not that good at cleaning or stuff like that but maybe making tea can be my thing then Master Bread will love me.
* * *
- Time to master a new hobby.
- Boil the water to 100 degrees first.
- Okay. The ratio of leaves to water should be one to no fifty.
- No, no! That tastes like garbage.
- * * *
- Steam bun? Maybe I should go directly to the tea master.
- Hey, good morning sir.
- Morning.
- Hey, why isn't wilk here?
- Not sure. Found this when I came in
- Master Bread. I've decided to become a tea master. I shall travel many miles to obtain this knowledge. Farewell.
- Uh... Why is he the way that he is?
* * *
- Hello? Anyone here?
- Are you the famous tea master? Nice to meet you.
- I'm welcome I'd like your help
- I don't sell directly to customers. You'll have to go to a store
- Wait. I didn't come here to buy tea. I've come here to learn the art of making tea.
- Please accept me as your humble student.
- You think anyone can just come in here and learn?
- I no longer take students
- I refuse to leave this place not until you agree to teach me.
- If you insist I shall take you on as my student.
- But are you prepared to undergo extensive and rigorous training my boy?
- Yes sir. I won't disappoint you sir.
* * *
- The purest tea comes from the purest water.
- Collect the dewdrops from gentle leaves in the early morning.
- Tea made from this water is exquisite and fresh. It is called morning glory leaf tea.
- Tea can sense your passion.
- Give it everything you've got.
- Humble yourself before the tea pot.
- Hey I'm still narrating here.
- Tea doesn't care if you hurt your knee. This brew is called get up and stop being dramatic afternoon black tea.
- Oh yeah. Oh man, this is tiring. I can do it!
* * *
- Wilk, you have mastered the art of the brew.
- There is nothing more for you to learn here. You should return to your life.
- But I'm not ready to leave. How can I make tea without your guidance?
- Never fear. I have something for you here.
- What's this?
- There. A special tea set passed down through each generation of my family.
- This is the tea set of the steam bun family legacy?
- Yes. You deserve it after completing your training so well. Use it wisely.
- Thank you so much. Thank you sir.
- This thing retails for 5,500 bucks but I'll give you the special student discount of 5,000 flat.
- Five thousand dollars? That's way more than I can afford.
- Because you are such a good disciple, I'll throw in an extra teaspoon set for free. Can't brew amazing tea without this.
- Three teaspoon set? You rule! I'm so happy I came here to learn sir.
* * *
- Huh? Wilk! Where have you been? What are you wearing?
- Choco, I'll need silence in here, to brew the perfect pot of tea. Do you understand?
- Good quality surely the steam bun family legacy will bless this tea.
- Ah. Such a lovely shade. It's the color of years of love and respect for the art of tea.
- I should give it a sip before giving it to Master Bread.
- That's so gross. Why is it so bitter?
- It expired 30 years ago? I can't believe that stupid bun!
- All teas are the same. It's just dirty leaf water anyway.
* * *
- I spent all my money on this stupid set. This tastes like garbage.
- What's this? That magical smell. Huh?
- Master Bread, wait! NO!
- Misty so good. Brings me back to my days of the English countryside.
- I've done for I'm done.
- Wilk, this tea is phenomenal. I've never tasted anything quite so good.
- Wait, really? you know it.
- It's royal milk tea. No, more like royal Wilk tea.
- Wilk go make me some tea, tea master.
- Yes sir.
