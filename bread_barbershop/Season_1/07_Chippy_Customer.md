# Chippy Customer

- Wow, I thought this place would be fancier but, turns out it's kind of a dub.
- Welcome to our shop. How can we help you today?
- How long do I gotta wait for a haircut?
- The wait is about an hour right now.
- An hour? I don't have that long to wait.
- We have been here a while.
- I've been here for like two hours.
- I apologize everyone. Sometimes it just takes a bit of time to get the best haircut for you.
- Don't give me those half-baked excuses. This place should be ashamed of itself.
* * *
- And here's your receipt.
- 30 bucks for fresh whipped cream? 50 just for fruit topping? This place reeks of a scam.
- That does seem steep.
- I have to choose between a haircut or my phone bill.
- Well, we only use high quality ingredients and those can be pricier.
- High quality? Oh crust. How are we supposed to know that's real?
- I've never seen a shop that costs this much with this long await.
- If I were you, I'd go someplace that valued my time and money, not this dumb.
* * *
- I mean, some of what he said is not wrong.
- But I thought this place was supposed to be the best.
- Should we try to find a new barber shop?
* * *
- Morning.
- Master Bread. Come look. Something's gone wrong.
- What do you mean? Huh, what's this?
- Hello everyone this is Bakery X-files. I'm croissant. Bread Barbershop has long been known as the best salon in town.
* * *
- Good morning, Choco. Good morning, Master Bread.
- But our exclusive look reveals high rising prices and crummy service.
- Sometimes it just takes a bit of time to get the best haircut for you. If you don't like it, go somewhere else.
- I don't remember saying that.
- They charge far more than the average salon ripping off unsuspecting customers.
- We only use high quality ingredients or not. That's just what we tell customers so they give us all their cash.
- That's fake.
- This is slander. Someone's just trying to bring us down.
- Hey Wilk. Where'd you get that?
- Oh this? The new hair salon across the street is giving away snacks.
- It's... It's that nasty chip who came in here yesterday. He's the one behind all this, I'm sure.
- The nerve!
- Tired of expensive haircuts? Don't want to wait too long for that new do? Come on down the potato chip hair shop.
- We're the fastest and cheapest shop this side of the bakery aisle.
- Oh.
- Every haircut just a buck! In and out in 10 minutes.
- I'll go check this out.
- Master bread, I'm coming too.
* * *
- We use the latest technology to ensure every customer gets their new look in 10 minutes.
- Can you prove it?
- How's it work?
- I'm gonna come here from now on.
* * *
- I'm done for. Done for.
- Master Bread. Don't feel down. There must be something we can do.
- Good morning.
- What's with the swater?
- Oh well if we get flies, I figured I'd swat him as something to do.
- Seriously?
- Choco, you're so smart.
- Wait a sec. How come there aren't any flies in the shop today?
- Hey that's weird all the flies are gathered around potato chips shop.
- They're what?
* * *
- Wow! even bugs like it.
- Hmm... Something seems off.
- Are you sure this is okay?
- If you want to lose your job when the shop closes, be my guest.
- Something's odd about this place let's go see.
- This place is really new and modern inside.
- That's a lot of whipped cream spray. Usually I have to make fresh whipped cream every morning but, this seems a lot more convenient.
- Wilk! Watch out!
- What a great idea this is!
- Wilk, are you okay?
- Help me. I think I broke my straw.
- Huh? Whis stuff expired ages ago.
- What? Are you serious?
- And it's not just the cream, this fruit he's using is rotten and stale.
- With all this mess it's no wonder the flies gather around this place.
- What a shady thing to do!
- Hmm?
- Hey! It's the remote control for the machine that does the hair. It looks like this button turns it on.
- Wow, that thing goes real fast. If only we had a machine like this in our shop.
- No way! It can speed up even more?
- Wilk! Stop that!
* * *
- Wilk!
- Please help me. This is not my friend.
- That's... Definitely the plunger we use for our toilet.
- Ear pick, tweezers. Please don't tell me he's using these dirty tools for hair.
- We should take pics as evidence.
* * *
- I don't know how he can get away with this.
- We should tell everyone his shop is gross.
- Wilk! Are you all right?
- Huh?
- It... It can't be... It's not a potato chip can. Just a big trash can!
- He turned a trash can into a hair salon?
- That's the one found in bathrooms, right?
- What? That's even more grody.
- All the more for evidence.
* * *
- Get your hands off me. Dirty bacon donuts.
- I was blamed.
- Once a rising star now yesterday's rotten potato, a shocking story of filth and deceit as potato chips hair shop shuts down due to unsanitary practices.
* * *
- I saw that coming. Everyone knows I'm the best. I wasn't worried at all.
- Wilk, Choco. I'm expecting lots of customers today, so be prepared for them.
- Yes sir.
