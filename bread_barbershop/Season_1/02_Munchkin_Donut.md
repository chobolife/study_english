# Munchkin Donut

- It's okay, love. It'll be over soon.
- Yeah, hey sweetie, listen to me. I think we can be great friends.
- We're not friends. You are a bit stale!
- I'm not... I'm not stale. Still working at a hair salon. I've wasted my whole life.
- Hey, are you good? I'm not sure what to do.
- I could have been an architect.
- What do I do? My son's hair is making him look like some sort of common crawler.
- There is one way. There's him, the true master.
- Who now?
- Yes! This is a job for Master Bread.
* * *
- Wow I look so cool!
- You see? I told you he was worth a three-month wait. I feel like a whole new donut.
* * *
- I don't wanna get my hair cut. I don't want it now!
- Could it be?
- Choco, code red!
- Here you go!
- Hello. Is there Mr. Bread here?
* * *
- No! Don't cut my hair!
- Look what we have here. Someone's being a cranky boy. Does he maybe want some candy? Yes there you go. Now how about a haircut?
- What is that? It tastes like licorice.
- I'm so embarrassed. I don't know why he's always been this way.
* * *
- Find your happy place, aloof of Zen.
* * *
- That's all right. Just a part of growing up.
- Wow. Why don't we watch some cartoons on my tablet?
- I haven't even paid that off yet.
* * *
- Buy a new one. There's that new model.
* * *
- He's the coolest donut ranger, isn't he?
- I swear in the name of gluten.
- No sir, don't lose your cool. He's just a child.
- You rascal! Very ranger was a limited edition!
* * *
- All right. This was all a waste of time. We'll leave. He is too much for you.
- Please don't go. Choco, bring it to me.
- But... are you sure that there's no other way?
- Just bring it to me.
* * *
- This is the worst place in the world!
* * *
- What is that?
- Mom, looks so funny!
- He's calm down now. Timely style.
* * *
- I've never seen someone work so quickly like that! It's like the raisin gave him superpowers.
- Yeah that's true. It's not the first time he's had to pull out all the stops.
- He looks so good. I'll tell all the other parents about you.
* * *
- Oh hey, how come you're in so early?
- Ah I'm never cutting another kid's hair as long as I live.
- Please don't make a scene. Master bread is going to cut your hair so nice.
- I won't. No way.
- I heard that he is best with the kids.
- Yes, he is. I heard that, too.
