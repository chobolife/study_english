# April Fool's Day

- Good morning.
- Choco, what are you doing?
- What's this?
- Well, sir. That's my letter of resignation. I'm quitting. Thanks a bunch.
- Oh, I don't have to call you, sir. Bye.
- Why all of a sudden like this?
- I bought a lottery ticket and won. So I'm gonna go travel around the world.
- Choco. Oh, please don't leave me here alone with Wilk to find someone else. He's so useless.
- Sir, you're really gullible, aren't you?
- Today's April fool's. I was tricking you.
- A little joke, huh? I don't like lies.
- Know what I think? Let's pull a prank on Wilk.
- Wilk? Oh sounds like fun. Do you have anything in mind?
- This is a fake thermometer. You press it against the skin like so? Fake fever.
- Oh, interesting. Oh, we're gonna get Wilk so good. I can't wait.
***
- These lollipops are the best. I can't wait to share them with everyone.
- Wilk, come look. Master Bread is really sick.
- Whoa! Master Bread!
- See that? He has a fever and he's weak. It could be bad.
- Oh, 112. Is that real?
- Wilk, when I'm gone, look... look after the shop for me.
- Master, don't talk like that. You live!
- Get ahold of yourself. We need to figure out how to help him.
- Wait, I know. I'll make him some healing soup.
- That kid's a sucker.
***
- Some chili peppers, some garlic, oh, a little ginger. Perfect.
- What is that?
- My family's been making this recipe for years.
- No one's sick after they drink this soup.
- They either die instantly or get better.
- What?
- Voila. Bon appetit, Master Bread.
- You drink that?
- I know it doesn't smell good. But I'm sure if you drink it, you'll be good as new.
- Is this really necessary?
- Keep playing along. Chuck it down.
- Looks like this is the only way to keep up the lose.
- Wow, great job. Spicy foods are so good for colds. Drink it all up.
- Ah!
- Wilk, that's good stuff thanks a bunch.
- He's still got a fever.
- What next?
- Oh, actually I feel fine.
- Wait right there, sir.
***
- All the ice from the freezer should cool your body down.
- Are you feeling better yet, sir?
- It's not working one bit.
- What?
- He must have pneumonia.
- Pneumonia? That's just supposed terrible.
- Master Bread, climb on. I'll take you to the hospital.
- Oh, that's not necessary.
- Hang on! we're gonna play Wilk for a fool.
- It'd be a shame to just stop here.
- Hurry. If we leave now we'll get there soon.
- Okay. sounds great.
***
- Someone help. we've got a case of pneumonia over here.
- This friend used to just be a grumpy old man, but now he's sick and old.
- Jeez. How old does he think I am?
- Can you hear me, sir? We made it to the hospital. You pull through.
- Please, sir. Can you hear me? How many fingers do you see?
- Hold still.
- What's the problem?
- Doctor, please. This old bread has pneumonia and he's old with a fever, too.
- Hmm... That first look he seems to be okay.
- That can't be true he's over 112.
- Hmm... well then, let's give him a shot immediately.
- A shot?
- It's just a little pinch.
- Oh, please. I'm fine.
- Sir, the patient appears to be unconscious.
- Prepare the paddles. Crank to maximum heat. I won't lose another one.
- Yes, sir.
- Master, I am here. Everything is going to be fine.
***
- Nurse, maximum toasty level now.
- Yes.
- Our patient is awake again.
- I didn't have to be burnt alive.
- His temperature's still high. Not good.
- Tell me doctor. Does it look like Master Bread will live?
- There's only one thing left to do. Surgery.
- Surgery? What kind of a quack doctor are you?
- Master. You have to play along.
- He almost burned me up. I'm finished with April fools. I'm done.
- If you come clean to Wilk right now, he'll never trust you again. Even as a boss.
- You've come this far, just a little more. This will be the greatest prank ever.
- He's agreed to the surgery now.
- What now? Let me go.
- Master, if you don't pull through, I'll take good care of shop for you.
- Oh, what the cross?
- We'll start with a routine lofotamy.
- A bread knife?
- All right stop. it's fake. It was free from fools.
- The thermometer was fake. Choco made me do it.
- We just wanted to break poor Wilk.
- Surprise!
- Surprise?
- That's right. Me and Choco were actually the ones pranking you all along.
- We had to come in early just to prepare for this and that's something I never do.
- And these two?
- Oh, we're real, but we wanted to be in on the joke with them.
- It was a lot of fun, too.
- I have never been more frightened in my entire life.
- You two are gonna be responsible for buying me new pads.
- Forgive me, Master.
