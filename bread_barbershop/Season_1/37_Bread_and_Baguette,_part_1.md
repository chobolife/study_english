# Rival, Baguette

Well, kid. This is the Sweet Bun barbershop.
I'd like you to meet the other assistant here. I hope you two get along well.
Yes, thank you, sir.
***
Wow.
Oh, yes. Let me introduce you to my assistant of the past 10 years, Baguette.
Baguette.

# Bread and Baguette, part 1

Hey, Baguette.
Must be... Potato Chip?
Yep. Hope you had a nice flight.
Why did you call?
Do you know somebody named Bread?
Bread?
***
Congratulations. What's your secret to being named the best barbershop five years in a row?
Oh, there's nothing to it, really.
Just a pair of eyes that can see the customer's soul.
Plus a creative but also genius brain, and ten fingers that make magic.
Something like that I guess.
You're so cool.
This wraps up the interview for today, sir.
And what does this young gentleman do?
Wilk does... Well, he mostly drops things. It's what he does best.
See? What I tell you.
Right. And what does the young lady over there do?
Choco's our cashier. But she's always shopping online. I'm a cool boss.
Well, then, how about we gather the employees for a photo?
That's not necessary. You just need one. I'm the owner of this shop after all.
***
Hey, Bread.
That chip. What on earth do you want?
Did I hear right?
You're the best in town? Huh, what a laugh.
Why you...
Bread says he's great, but there's someone else who's even better.
He just came from the Barbers Academy in France. Mr. Baguette.
Hey. It's...
It's been a while. Do you remember me?
You know he defeated every barber shop in Paris.
So he's basically the best in the world.
Better than this crusty old bread man.
Baguette? I've never heard of him.
Who's he?
Wow. Your reputation's incredible.
Do you mind showing a sample for the viewers back home?
No way. Ugh. Mr. Baguette a busy man. He has no time.
Holy cheese. I've never felt so cute. That's just amazing, sir.
How do you like that?
Maybe you can learn a thing from the world's best, huh?
I know. what if we held a contest to see who was the best barber in town once and for all?
Oh, yeah. Audiences love a game show. Let's start right now.
Start recording the network will eat this stuff.
***
Master Bread, are you ready to go? This guy looks like he might be really good.
Huh, please. A piece of cake. After all I beat him once years ago.
Huh?
I remember like it was yesterday.
***
Welcome back, sir.
Hello. there's someone I'd like you to meet Baguette.
Hi.
Bread will be starting here as an apprentice with us as of today. Be kind.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, hey there.
***
Oh.
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I...
Watch it kid.
***
Huh? No way.
It's so cute. Thank you.
Brilliant. Too brilliant.
***
The time has come for me to retire now.
One of you will take over the shop from me today.
You will compete to see who wins ownership of the store.
***
That kid might be good. But he's only worked here a couple of months.
He's no match for the skills I've honed over a decade.
Incredible. Well done, Bread. You have a talent I've never seen before. The student truly has exceeded the master.
Baguette.
***
That was the last I heard from him before he showed up here.
Don't fear. I'll beat Baguette just like I did before.
***
And we're back. The hottest battle between the two barbershop rivals is about to start.
Whoever creates the most impressive hairstyle in a limited amount of time will be the winner.
Ready, start.
Now I'd like to finish my tea first.
Huh?
Wait. What just happened? He did it so fast I missed it.
And it looks awesome.
Oh, wow. It looks like we have our winner.
The best barber is Baguette.
Wow.
Well, do you have anything you'd like to say to the audience? Oh.
Bread, you're just the same as you were all those years ago. Pathetic.
What... What are you... Oh
Hey folks. If you want Mr. Baguette to do your hair, then come to Potato Chip's Hair Salon.
It's faster and better than Bread Barbershop could ever be.
***
Sir, are you okay? Don't be down. Let's just watch some TV and relax.
Bread's just old news.
Yes, and he's arrogant too.
The hottest place in town is Potato Chip Hair Shop.
Home of the genius barber, Baguette.
Something else.
Since he was just a bun in the oven, Baguette has tirelessly honed his craft.
His perseverance has made him exceed his peers tenfold.
Sir?
Leave me alone. Everyone! Get out now!
Master Bread, please open the door. Sir. Sir?
