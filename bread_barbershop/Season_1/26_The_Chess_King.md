# The Chess King

- Wilk, part of winning a chess is mastering a good poker face.
- My face just happens to be good at everything.
- And Choco, try making moves that are less predictable. Use all of your brain.
- Well, this brain has never played chess before.
- Uh, I remain the undefeated champion of the shop.
- Not yet, sir. You haven't even battled Sausage. Wanna play chess with him?
- Sausage? Yeah, I challenge our dog to a game.
* * *
- You cheated. You cheated!
- I lost track. How many has he lost?
- He's lost 17 games out of 17 games.
- Come back. Don't leave until I win.
- So... your boss finally lost it?
- Nah. Just losing a game of chess. Turns out Sausage plays it really well.
- Whoa. You mean Sausage is a dog who's good at chess?
- Mr. bread, you know what I do? I need your Sausage in the chess tournament in town.
- Chess tournament?
- Yeah. Bakery town holds its own tournament every year.
- And the winner gets a big prize, too.
- A prize?
- Cheese, go get a pen. We've got a tournament to win.
* * *
- What a lovely day.
- Good boy. You'd better win, otherwise we closed the shop today for not.
- He'll win, I know for sure.
- He beat you every time, didn't he?
- Sausage, I believe in you.
- Here's my application.
- Hey, entries go over there.
- Well, well, look what someone left at the back of the pantry.
- I really hope you half expired nitwits aren't entering this.
- It's that chip.
- No way. We're not dumb enough to send one of us to enter this thing.
- Our player is Sausage.
- Your dog? Playing chess against your dog?
- It's too much. A dog. And chess.
- Excuse me. There's no reason to be rude.
- You might not believe it, but Sausage has defeated Master Bread no fewer than 17 times.
- He's a better player than anyone in our shop, and he's cute.
- Wilk, don't you remember poker face?
- Sure. Good luck with that.
- Maybe after he wins, he can teach me to fetch and roll over.
* * *
- Doesn't that chip know when to shut his salty mouth?
- That chip is our biggest rival. He's last year's champion.
- Unfairly.
- Someone found out he cheated his way to the win.
- He put extra powerful laxatives in the other players drinks.
- And, well... Things got a little messy.
- Then he sabotaged the directions to the bathroom so everyone else would get lost.
- I wonder what that rotten chip will get up to this year.
- Please, I'm sure none of us are dumb enough to fall for his high jinks.
- Yeah, that's true. I bet we'll stop him first.
- Oh, why... My stomach's hurting and not feeling nice.
- Wilk, what's wrong?
- Whoa, you good?
- I don't understand. The only thing I had to eat was the juice Potato Chip gave me earlier today.
- Nice job, Wilk. Now where's that rotten potato?
- He's the worst. Can't believe he's trying his dirty tricks already?
- Hey, guess this thing doesn't start till three o'clock.
- Looks like I have time for some coffee.
- Bye.
- Yep.
- Sausage, what do you want to do until then?
- Checkmate.
- The tournament isn't at three o'clock? It's at one. Master Bread! Master Bread!
- The chip even fooled Master Bread.
- Sausage, I'll be here for you even if they're gone, okay?

- Welcome chess players and chess pies from bakery town.
- I'm your host, Croissant. Now let's get started.
- Only one will be crowned as the king of chess or queen. Let's be modern.
- Anyway, let's begin.
- Our first contestant comes all the way from the ice box, a scone scholar from bread state majoring in sugar economics, Choco Donut.
- And over here we have someone's dog I think, a Sausage.
- Go, Sausage!
- Who will advance to round two today? Let's see and play.
- Whoa I'm not believing what's happening before my eyes.
- Sausage has taken down the opponent's king with nothing more than a humble knight.
- This pup's going on to the quarter finals.
- Well done, Sausage. Keep going and you can win.
- He does it again folks. Make room for hot links in the semifinals.
- And again? He's made it to the final round. Go, hot dog, go.
- Wow Sausage, you're just the best.
* * *
- A lot of false confidence over here.
- Don't you have socks to chew up or fire hydrants to pee on?
- You, bad chip.
- Master Bread and Wilk might have fallen for your tricks.
- But we're never gonna let that happen to Sausage.
- Ha. Fooling those morons was just embarrassingly easy.
- And the apple-smoked Sausage doesn't fall far from the tree.
* * *
- And now it comes to this. Our final round.
- These two contestants will go down in chess history for all time.
- He's sour, he's salty, and he's not even salt and vinegar flavor.
- Put your hands together for our returning champion, Potato Chip.
- And today's breakout superstar, the underdog, the dark horse or dog. It's Sausage.
- Go, boy. Let them have it.
- All right. Now without any further ado, let's start.
* * *
- Amazing! How did such a thing happen?
- Potato Chip's king is left completely defenseless. He must feel so dumb.
- Looks like this pup is on course to be our top dog.
- He's smart, I'll give him that.
- Need to bring out the big guns.
- It's time to fight dirty.
- Not hungry, are you? I brought some jerky.
- That's not fair. He's distracting the competition with good smelling food.
- Come on. There's no rule that says I can't bring out a snack for myself.
- No such rule exists. The game will carry on.
- Oh, no.
- He's losing it.
- Sausage, I'll be here for you even if they're gone, okay?
* * *
- Oh, sweet honey buns.
- What? Are you ready to play now or something?
- No more jerky smell to distract me.
- You're going down, rotten potato.
- I'll be boiled before I let myself lose to a dog.
- Take this mongrel.
- Come on boy. Make us proud. You can do it.
- My word! He won!
- Sausage has won this round to become this year's champion.
- Yeah! Hooray! Sausage, I'm so proud of you.
- No. It's not fair. That stinky cheese cheats.
- That's not true. The only one who's cheating here is you.
- It's not. I... I...
- Stop! Let go put me down. I was framed.
- Seems to be a lot of commotion in here.
- Long before the competition even starts.
- Hey guys. How'd the competition go?
- Went great. Sausage came first. He even defeated Potato Chip.
- What? It's done already? I thought I had a few hours to kill.
- That's awesome. I knew you would win, you smart little doggy.
- And now to present the grand prize to our first place winner, which is this way station two.
- Huh? That thing's the prize? What about money?
- Yay, a real way station two.
- Yay, it's got all the list of games.
- Wow, I can't believe we got one.
- Wilk, let's play it together.
- Time for a photo with the champion now.
- Yeah, sounds great.
- Master Bread, get in the picture.
- Okay, everybody say Sausage.
- Sausage.
