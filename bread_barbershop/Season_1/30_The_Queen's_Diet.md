# The Queen's Diet

- Send this swindler to jail immediately.
- Please. Give me another chance, your majesty.
- Silence. Send him away.
- Your majesty, mercy. Mercy!
- Ah... you call yourself a fitness expert, but I didn't lose a single pound.
- And next week is the bakery Valentine's day speech.
- How am I supposed to speak like this?
- My subjects will be expecting a trim cake, but I've put on a bit of flowers since my heyday.
- Oh dear. I'm stressed. I feel faint. I should eat something now.
***
- Who needs therapy when you can have chocolate?
- At this rate the queen will only be sold at a bulk warehouse store.
- Even worse, she'll throw us in jail. We have to do something.
- But what? all the diet experts you brought in have failed.
- Ah, that's right. There's him.
- Who?
- The bread man. They say he's the most genius barber in the bakery.
***
- Bread, you'll have to come with us right now, sir.
- Wait, wait, what's going on? Let me go.
***
- We've really tried. But nothing seems to work.
- Please, say you'll help us, Master Bread.
***
- You foolish pastries! There's only one week left until I give my big speech.
- Are you gonna make me look good?
- Your majesty, Master Bread has arrived.
- What? Bread?
- A good... good day your highness.
- This ugly old man? That's him?
- Yes. He's the best in town. He's highly sought after. He's changed the lives of countless...
- Yeah, yeah, whatever. I don't care. Bread, I command you to make me look small.
***
- Oh, my. That's incredible.
- Bravo!
- Thanks a lot. You saved our lives.
- Oh, we're so grateful.
- About time you found someone this good.
- That smell... Is it garlic? I smell delectable.
- No way. That's so delicious.
- No, your highness please stop. Those noodles aren't meant for that.
- Yummy.
- You think I'm stupid. Where did my beautiful hair go, you thief?
- Get him. Take this bread straight to the dungeon jail, and you'll all pay for bringing me this bread.
- Your majesty, mercy. Mercy, your majesty!
***
- I'm innocent. Please, wait.
- Oh, a newbie, ah?
- Welcome to the dungeon.
***
- So... hungry. It's so close.
- Anyone who can make the queen smaller sit down here.
- They've all failed. You'll fit right in, too.
***
- Ah, it's no use, man!
- You know what? This is your fault for over-indulging. You cake!
- Oh, that's it! I know how to get out of here.
***
- What's that? You have a better idea now?
- Yes, that's right.
- If you fail me again, I'll fry you an egg batter.
- We'll leave you in a toaster for too long.
***
- This is so exciting.
- I can't believe it's been 10 years since we've seen the queen.
- I heard it's because she looks different.
- I heard she's family size now.
***
- Come one and all. May I present your queen.
- She's as beautiful as ever.
- She looks like she hasn't aged a day.
***
- Please don't move. Let me see you. I need to focus.
- How dare you speak to me like this, you silly Bread.
- If you want to look slim you'll do exactly as I say.
- I guess I can comply, but if you fail again, you're going straight to jail.
***
- Yeah. How will covering me and coco work?
- I'm just gonna smell like chocolate paint.
- It's working.
- Truly you look great.
- For real? Let me see. Somebody bring me a mirror.
- Yes.
- My word! I look just like I did ten years ago.
- Bread, you really are the best. We should have tried this before I threw all those people in jail.
***
- Her next meeting is on April 5th.
- She's requested her background be purple next time, so please prepare purple.
- She'll be at a ball game the following day.
- We'll need her to look like a giant soccer ball then.
- Shouldn't be too hard for you.
- The queen's schedule is always planned out a year in advance.
- Please don't make other appointments until then.
- You're to be the queen's official barber from now on.
- Oh, it's my favorite carpenter whole wide world.
- Today you had better make me look super cute.
- No! Please. You'll send me back to the dungeon.
