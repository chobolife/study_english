# A Bun to Remember

- Is that you? From 100 years ago?
- Wilk!
- Master Bread, who's this old guy in the picture with you?
- Hmm...
***
- This town ain't big enough for the likes of you.
- Yeah. It barely fits us.
- Get lost, burger.
- Sheriff, get a jail cell ready for these fools.
- How dare you!
- Reach for the sky you, undercooked patty.
- This town is safe.
- Hamburger. Hamburger.
- Whoa. Burger's so amazing on stage.
***
- Next tuesday.
- Who is it?
- Huh? Who on earth?
- Hello, sir. My name's Bread and I'm a background actor here.
- Oh, you scared us. What do you want?
- Can you tell me if I can do acting like you?
- Acting?
- No. Mr. Hamburger's a busy man. He doesn't have time to coach hopeless kids.
- It's fine. We should encourage kids to drink. Let's see what you got.
- Thanks. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks.
- I've been waiting to uh... revenge you. I mean, this town is big enough. I... wait... No. It's not big. Enough.
- What the crust was like?
- That was disastrous. You come into my dressing room and waste my time like that?
- Here's my advice you're better off doing anything else.
- I'm late. Oh, dear. I'm late.
- What now?
- My stylist!
- Are you hurt?
- No. I'm okay.
- Oh.
- Mr. Sweet Bun. Did he hurt you?
- I think my wrist has been sprained. I don't think I can work today.
- Can't work?
***
- Hello? We need a stylist now.
- Right now. It's urgent. We need help.
- There's no one?
- You! This is all your fault.
- But...
- It wasn't enough to waste our time. Now you have to go and ruin the whole play.
- Don't you know the value of community theater?
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Yes. These are the hands belonging only to the chosen one.
- Huh?
- Why don't we give this lad a shot as a stylist?
- What? No. I don't even know why he's here. He's a talentless fool.
- Wait. This boy has a gift no stylists have seen for hundreds of years.
- His fingers are perfect for holding scissors. His palm lines foretell his success.
- Even the freckles on his arm make a scissors constellation. It's your destiny.
- No way, sir. I don't know the first thing about.
- My hand hurts. I won't be able to hold anything ever again.
- With no one to replace me, this theater's performance is done for.
- Just think of all those poor people who've already bought tickets.
- Okay. I'll help out.
- You will?
- But please teach me. I don't know what to do.
- Never fear son.
***
- You're telling me this moron's gonna do our makeup and hair?
- Well, it seems we have no other choice left.
- Old man bun, if this fails then it's on you.
- You can trust me.
- Hmm... you win. But if you fail, I can promise you. You'll never work in this town again.
- Embrace your destiny son.
***
- He cut the tomato. Why?
- I'm curious to see how well he does.
- Wow. He cut the cheese.
- Hey, making bacon is a fire hazard.
- Wait. Let the boy work. He might be onto something.
- He does remember what he's supposed to be doing, right?
- Maybe he's just making lunch.
- Hmm. Hey. What's the meaning of this?
- What has he done?
- This is outrageous.
- Incredible.
- He's become a bacon tomato cheeseburger now.
- Yes, I knew I was right about him.
- Hey, you're not half bad. You're horrible at acting. But you made me look real nice.
- Wow. That guy knows what he's doing.
- He should do this as a career.
***
- This town is safe.
- Wow, Hamburger looks even better than usual. He looks great.
- I agree.
***
- Young man, what would you say if I gave you a job?
- Yes, it can be hard to walk away from something you love.
- But it's important to foster our talent, and you have talent.
- Yes. Thank you so much.
***
- Hey. Clean the floor over here. It's filthy.
- Of course, I'll get that cleaned up right away.
- That one time I almost fell down.
- Sorry ma'am. Let me get that for you.
***
- Mr. Sweet Bun. He was the bread who made me who I am today.
