# Movie Star Bread

- Wilk, let's get ready to make everyone look good.
- That's right. Monday is the start of a whole new week of hard work.
- Ooh, my barber level is over 9,000.
- Good work at the kid.
- Choco, it's 10 after 10. Why are you late?
- My bad. Some movie was filming and they blocked the road.
- Huh? What movie?
- Some Donut Ranger movie or something. It's across the street.
- Donut Ranger?
- Wait. I'm coming too.
* * *
- Scene two, take seven.
- I am the protector of bakery town. Ranger.
- Cut. Good take. You know all the fangirls will really love that one.
- Let's do the next scene now.
- Ranger kicked my buns.
- Donut Ranger always clenches his fist when he donut kicks the enemy.
- But I clearly saw a thumb sticking out of the side, which ruins it.
- I know, and they're getting the name wrong too.
- It's not ranger kick it's ranger ultra kick now.
- Ugh. They've got Donut Ranger all wrong. Looks like this movie's ignoring the Donut Ranger universe.
- I know. Episodes four through six of the original Donut Ranger trilogy were amazing beyond words.
- These prequels don't hold a candle to the original ones.
- What? Why you...
- What's going on here? You need to zoom in extra close on Donut Ranger so the explosions look extra explosiony.
- Oh, I don't...
- Unbelievable. Look at this.
- This lighting is all wrong for Donut Ranger. Kilo is unflattering for his donut hole.
- Oh, no. wilk is right. This light should be blue. What are you doing to him?
- Why are you here? This is a close set get out.
- We haven't done anything wrong. You can't kick us out.
- We're just really big fans of Donut Ranger.
- Fans are the absolute worst things to have. Now get out.
- Excuse me? We have something to say to you.
* * *
- What do you mean you quit?
- You never pay us on time and I've got a mortgage.
- There's not even craft services.
- Wait, wait, we can work this out.
- Tough luck. I gotta feed little ones at home.
- You can call us again once you have an actual budget.
- How am I supposed to make this movie without bad guys? Come back.
- Looks like someone's in need of a couple of actors.
- That's right, and some of us have a little acting experience under our belts, too.
* * *
- All right, weirdos. You good?
- Never better. Back in my day I was the fastest rising star in the world.
- I had to leave the industry just so someone else could have a fighting chance.
- This is my triumphant return.
- Yeah, whatever that's all great. Rolling. Action.
- Donut Ranger. It's your turn. Time to fight.
- Ah-ha. Cut, cut. What on earth?
- Oh, was... Was that too good?
- Only if you're a robot, put some feeling into it.
- Oh my expressions are too subtle for the big screen. Back when I studied Meisner method at Bread State universial.
- Whatever. Wilk, it's up to you.
- Yeah, you can count on me sir. I have every line from the comic books memorized by heart.
- Don't care. Rolling. Action.
- What was the line again? It's harder to remember now that I'm on camera.
- Holy cannoli.
* * *
- Here. this next scene is an action shot where you chase the hero firing lasers.
- Don't mess it up.
- Of course I won't. I never once needed a stunt double.
- Yeah, yeah. Now I got a headache. Rolling. action.
- Get ready to taste my laser gun.
- Cut. Why are you making the sound effects yourself?
- I'm a method actor. I do my own effects.
- No. We have the sound effects later in post. From now on, only say what's in the script.
- And another thing. What's wrong with you? You get dropped on your head as a kid?
- Yeah, how do you know?
- Don't dance back to me. Are you two a toast?
- I understand, but I'm milk not toast.
* * *
- Okay, in this next scene Donut Ranger is captured by aliens.
- It's a stun shot, so you'll have to hit him as hard as you can. You got that?
- Rolling. Action.
- This is it, Donut Ranger.
- Oh, no. I can't do it, sir. Red is my favorite ranger.
- What?
- Ever since I was a little kid, red ranger's been my hero.
- I could never hit you red. Instead I would take a hit for you.
- I can't make that happen.
- Other bread! You're up now.
- You can't be mentally weak if you want to be an actor. Now watch the master.
- No, I can't do it, either.
- Are you okay?
* * *
- In this scene there's a kick in midair.
- You both attack the struggling ranger.
- It's the big climax of the movie. So don't mess it up.
- Let's just see if we can get one thing right.
- I am an actor. I'll bring out all the stops for the most important scene in the movie.
- Let's go. We got this.
- Let's give this a shot. Rolling. Action.
- Good work. Do the money shots.
- Are you okay?
- Someone get the paper work.
- What have we done?
* * *
- Get out. I don't want to see any more of you two. I'm hiring some new actors.
- What? No. Director, please. Give us a chance to be in the movie. We'll do anything.
- I promise I won't mess up anymore. Please let us serve, please.
- No chance! You won't ruin this for me. Do we have new actors yet?
- We don't. We can't film anything anymore.
- Our lighting is broken. Along with the spirits of most of the crew and also our cameron boom.
- Then just go buy some new equipment.
- Our production budget doesn't have anything left.
- Yeah... why won't this day ever end?
- Step for cash huh? How much will it cost? I've always wanted to invest.
- Please, movies costs more than a few bucks. We're talking big time money here.
- Wilk, how much money is in my account?
- 54 million 69 thousand, sir.
- If he wants to be an investor, let's go along.
- You should definitely take what he gives you. I mean you want to get paid too, right?
* * *
- Since he's willing to pay up... but they're still the worst.
- How do I salvage these messes into an acceptable performance?
* * *
- We meet again. Prepare to fight.
- Cut. Okay. Moving on.
- Awesome. Next scene.
- About time he recognized how great my acting is?
- Me too. I think I'm finally getting this stuff.
- I'm sure he had to pretend to criticize us before.
- I know he had to save face in front of the crew and such.
- What's the line again?
- Perfect. Great work.
* * *
- Wow, I'm in a real movie. It's a dream come true, isn't it?
- Amateur.
- Hey, it's starting.
- Donut Ranger episode 15. Attack of the robocarbs.
- Huh? Robo?
- Hey, it's you.
- We meet again. Prepare to fight.
- What is this?
- Prepare to experience my powerful attack.
- Hang on. They made us character of robots.
- Another day, another robot defeated.
- What nonsense. Popcorn is gonna get a piece of my mind.
- And every single one of my lines ended up getting cut. That director must think we're a couple of adults.
- These villains were my favorite so far, so unique.
- I wonder how they did it. It didn't look like CGI at all.
- Of course, they're the best villains yet.
- Portraying a cold heartless robot is a feat very few can do.
- Yeah, you're right. Only your incredible acting skills could capture the robot feelings, and I was there, too.
- Time to go back to work.
