# Bread and Baguette, part 2

- I can't wait to see him.
- Didn't this guy beat Bread on a contest a while back?
- I heard he graduated top of his class in Paris.
- Since Baguette came, Potato Chip Hair Shop is the place to be.
***
- Nice. You definitely have that parisian flair.
- I'd like to pay now.
- Here's the bill.
- 2,000? What is this price? How dare you.
- Per lead. You should have checked the prices when you came in.
- But that's 10 times higher than last week's prices were.
- Don't bother coming in if you can't afford it.
- What are we supposed to do?
- There's no other barber shop in town.
- That's not my problem. Pay off and get out!
- He knows he's the only place in town but he raises his price so much.
- Come on down.
***
- Again? Jeez, kid. How many more plates can you possibly break?
- Does this look like a Greek place to you? You're fired.
- Huh, got fired again. Normal Wednesday.
- No place comes close to working at the Bread Barbershop.
- I wonder what Choco and Master Bread are doing.
***
- Welcome to Bakeryland where dreams come true. Have a magical day. Welcome in. Dreams come true.
- Choco.
- Hi friends. Gross. Wilk, in a minute.
- You're working at the theme park? That's great!
- Yeah it's magical. What about yourself?
- Me? I was working at the taco restaurant. But I got fired.
- Huh?
- Anyway this job must be fun.
- Welcome to Bakeryland where dreams come true.
- They make me stand in the hot sun all day with no breaks.
- I'm getting burned my arms hurt from waving, and the kids are horrible but other than that it's peachy.
***
- Mom. My head itchy.
- You'll be fine. Haircuts are expensive. We can't afford it.
- But I need a new haircut. It's stinky.
- What's going on there?
- Word has it potato chip hair shop raised their prices tenfold.
- They're a monopoly now. So nobody has money to get their hair done.
- That's terrible. Master Bread would fix this.
- You know what? We should find where he is and bring him back.
- You're right. I heard someone saw him near the dump.
- The dump? Isn't that a bad part of town?
***
- Hobo Bread.
- Hobo Bread.
- Here, you hungry bun?
- Hobo Bread.
- Hobo Bread.
- Stop it right now!
- You bratty kids. That's not very nice.
- Oh, misspelled milk, I'm so scared.
- Let's get out of here. That is one scary muffin.
- Sir!
***
- Master Bread. This is not the life for you.
- Potato Chip raised all the prices at his shop and nobody has anywhere else to go.
- Bakery Town needs you to come back again, sir.
- We need to run that chip out.
- The bread you knew has reached his expiration date.
***
- Come on.
- Hey, did you once run a barber shop?
- Those days are gone.
- You might not remember. But a long time ago, I was looking for a bathroom.
- I tucked into this barber shop to ask about one.
- Even though I was dirty and didn't have any money, this guy made me look like a whole new bread.
- I remember how good I felt leaving the shop that day.
- You shouldn't be living in this junkyard. Go on back.
***
- When are they gonna leave? And they only ordered one soda.
- How can we persuade Master Bread to come back?
- You can't convince someone like that guy.
- Did you two... used to work at the bread barber shop?
- It's him.
***
- Master Bread.
- Master Bread, we found someone who wanted to come and speak with you.
- Not this again. I'm never going back. You won't change my mind.
- Do you remember me, sir?
- It's you?
- Meet my wife and my son.
- I heard a lot about you, sir.
- Is that the hero guy?
- Yes, the magnificent barber I told you all about.
- Even though the crown hair you gave me didn't last forever, you gave me the confidence I needed to make something of myself.
- Master Bread. You may not know it, but you've helped a lot.
- Hi, there. My son's doing great in school.
- I want to be a barber like he is.
- Today I won best actor at the Bakery Film Festival. None of it would have happened without you.
- I'm the prettiest pie in the whole prison system.
- I don't want to get haircut.
- I'm getting married in a month all thanks to you.
- Can you do my bridal hair, too?
- You've helped the people of this town immensely, sir.
- And I found something that might be useful.
- Hey, it's hobo Bread.
- You see that?
- These scissors are a little dull. There's much work to do.
- Wilk, Choco. Let's go.
***
- A pair of scissors is only as good as the hands that wield them.
- Only sugar provides the training one needs to hone the perfect sense of touch.
- Only the most sensitive hands can find a single grain of sugar amongst millions.
- The best barber requires the best eyesight.
- Blinking his weakness, weakness.
- You win. You win again.
- Hairstyling requires stamina.
- I must hone my body to perfection.
- Nothing's less will do.
- Like the toe that rises in the yeast, I will rise triumphant.
- 501, 502, 503, 504, 505 and 506.
- Wow. That's your best one so far.
- You're the greatest, sir.
***
- Is that...?
