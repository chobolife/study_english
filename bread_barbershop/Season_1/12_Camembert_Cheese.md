# Camembert Cheese

- Hand it over now.
- What was that?
- You look pretty rich. Nice coach you got there.
- Let's see it kid. You won't miss it anyway.
- You really don't want to find out what happens if you lay one filthy hand on my coat.
- Filthy?
- You're gonna regret what you did. I guarantee it.
- Too cute. My legs are just shaking.
- This cheese must be dense. Have you lost your respect?
- Stop it. Leave him alone.
- Being a bully to someone weak isn't nice. What would your parents think if they saw you being mean?
- Where'd this baby milk come from?
- Why? Why feel sick?
- Hey, are you good? Hey.
* * *
- Where am I? What happened?
- You're not hurt, are you? Did they hurt you?
- You should mind your own business. Acting all tough trying to help me when you can't even defend yourself.
- Phew. I'm just glad we got away. How lucky! Well let's introduce ourselves. I'm Wilk and who are you?
- Camembert cheese.
- Camembert? You... You're supposed to have a famous smell, right?
- Famous? So what if I have a distinctive smell? Some people are just different, all right?

- Hi guys. Time to play.
- Class, please tell our new student hello. His name is Camembert cheese. Let's give him a warm welcome.
* * *
- Cheesy. That must have been so hard. How can I make your life better?
- Just leave me alone, okay? Your sympathy means nothing to me.
- Oh! Wait. Master Bread can help you. He knows how to fix everything.
- Master Bread?
- He's Bakery town's most amazing as barber. If anyone can get rid of a stinky smell, It's him.
- I seriously doubt a bread is qualified.
- Come on, huh? Just give him a chance I'll prove it to you. Why don't we just go right now?
- Hey. Let go this instant.
* * *
- Let's see... You need me to change your smell?
- Yeah if anyone can do it, it's you.
- Camembert cheese, huh? This might be tough.
- I knew it. Told you he wouldn't be able to help me.
- What?
- My family's stench is so strong not even doctors know what to do.
- Oh, I've smelled far worse than that. Yike, I've smelled ten times worse before. Do you know the legend of natto?
- Of the top three worth smelling legacies? That natto?
- The very one. I helped him get rid of his smell. If I hadn't all of sushi village would have been destroyed forever by the stench.
- Ha I don't know how bad those nattos are. But I can guarantee you we're worse.
- Uh there's another story that you don't know. You ever heard of a guy called stinky tofu?
- What? The stinky tofu?
- Life perished wherever stinky tofu went. That's how pungent his well his old self was. But after I helped him, peace was restored to Dimsum City.
- Wow Master Bread you never told me you saved the world.
- I saved the world twice. Well, take off that coat so we can start.
* * *
- Master Bread. Speak to me.
- I was wrong. He's too strong.
- Master!
- You see? This always happens. I should just be alone forever.
- Hey there. Here for my hair. Oh what's that stench?
- What's going on? Someone leave rotten milk in here?
- I've never smelled anything so foul.
- Huh?
- You there. You're cheese. But it must be him, no?
- Oh, I knew it. He looks like a Camembert.
- It is you, right?
* * *
- Camembert, no. Oh, no. It looks like cheese needs my help again.
* * *
- Whoopsie. Looks like lunch didn't sit so well.
- The nerve of doing that in front of customers.
- I guess you guys were right about that rotten milk after all.
- No way. That smells worse than one kid judy.
- You think this came from one person? It's more like.
- Oh no.
- Uh, I must have eaten something bad too. My stomach's in my fault.
- I've revolted too, Choco.
- Well what do you want me to do?
- Good trust. Oh no.
- Oh, no. Why am I tooting so much?
* * *
- Everyone's sick. Guess we'll come back next time.
- That is some putrid customer service. You will need a juice cleanse or something.
- Sorry everyone.
- Come back it'll make your hair look good.
* * *
- You did all that for me?
- Cheese. I'm sorry. We didn't help you with your smell like I said we would. But next time for sure.
- I'm so grateful. You saved me from embarrassment. Someday I want to be a dairy product just like you are.
* * *
- Okay, see ya.
- Hang on. Cheese is a dairy product.
