- Shouldn't I have a reason to smile?
- Yes. The fact that you're still employed.

- Looks fairly clean. Okay.
- Employees get regular paychecks, too.
- Employee happiness index... Hmm.
- Well... Seems you pass in every regard except your employee happiness index is low.
- That can't be true. They're happy, happiest in town, right?
- Sir, does this employee look happy to you?
- This shop is disqualified from receiving government subsidies until workplace joy is restored. Good day to you all.
- But... but wait! I need that money. Not again.
- It's your fault we're not chosen for the subsidy. This is a very joyful place to work. Can't you just smile?
- My silliest faces didn't work. I'll have to try.
- Master Bread, you look so silly.
