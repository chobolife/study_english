# Master Barber

- Master Twisted Bread is bakery town's greatest laundry expert.
- He can turn anything into a soft towel.
- Catch us next time on experts at work. See you next week.
* * *
- Wow, Choco look at that. Isn't that guy awesome?
- He should be if he's on TV.
- Everything on TV is fake. Real experts don't care about fame. Like me.
- Wouldn't it be cool if our barbershop could be on that?
- Huh?
* * *
- Welcome sir.
- Hmm.
- Hey, are you Master Bread?
- Says who?
- That's who I am.
- Half off karaoke?
- Wait, that's not right. Haven't you seen "Experts at Work"? I'm the director for that show.
- Wait, you directed it? Wow. I really love "Experts at Work". How great! I'm a huge fan.
- That's nice.
- So, what kind of haircut can I get you?
- Nah. I'm not here to get my hair done.
- We want you on our show, because we heard you're quite the expert.
- I am. I don't want to be on your show.
- Mr. Director man, Twisted Bread's laundry did well after the show.
- I heard your show brings in lots of business, is it true?
- Yep he doesn't know what to do with all his new customers. He even bought a new house.
- But don't take my word for it.
- Mr. donut's auto shop episode 37, Cheese stick's piano shop cheesy keys episode 92. All of them are living lodge.
- Oh...
- Yes, I'll have to go find another barber.
- Hang on. How soon can you start filming?
* * *
- Camera one! Get that boom. Come on cakes, let's move.
- And you, try to act normal. Just a couple of folks working at the shop.
- Ah... This place is dull. We need to spice things up.
- How long's this place been open for?
- How long? A while I guess.
- It's day 3752.
- You need a celebration for a day so meaningful.
- Let's run a promotion for 50 percent off for that day...  Uh... whatever.
- Audiences love a celebration. Hey, you want that cash, no?
* * *
- It's the 3752nd day of business and just for you 50 percent off all services.
- Yes, just for you. It's 50 percent off to celebrate.
- No, no, no. All wrong. We need more light from you.
- But that's just how I am. How else would I sprinkle it?
- Act cool, natural, but with excitement! Understand? Easy.
- Another day in the barbershop where it's not just hair, it's art.
* * *
- With each new day comes new challenges and Master Bread revitalizes customers with wild techniques.
- Customers come not only for a new do, but to relish in the artistry and the craftsmanship of this humble barber.
- Master are you hurt?
- Cut! Nice work.
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- Okay, next scene.
* * *
- Cut, cut! No. What audience is going to want to watch you working away like a mindless drone?
- But you told us all to act normal.
- Hey, do I have to make everything obvious for you?
* * *
- Even the day's menial tasks are performed with dexterity and delicious flair.
- What a treat for the customers.
- Got it.
* * *
- Awesome work here today everyone.
- He has no idea how much this all costs.
- All right. One more. Just a few more takes, and Master Bread can upgrade his shop.
* * *
- There you go.
- Cut, cut! This! Who gives out receipts this boring these days?
- See? There should be gimmicks and charm. Where's all that?
- I don't understand you.
- All for the love of rules. It's for the show.
- Something so elegant it gives the shop healing vibes.
- Is that so much to ask?
* * *
- Greetings, would you like your receipt, sir?
- Yes.
- One moment, my good sir.
- And such culture! Even their receipts are in the style of ancient Korean calligraphy, totally instagram-worthy.
- By the warm light of the oven, I thank you for coming. May your future be filled with self-rising food.
- That's not really necessary.
- Cut. That's where it's at. Where was that kind of flare all day.
- Uh... oh.
* * *
- Please come to the Bread Barber.
- Cut. That's a wrap. Thanks everyone, very natural every single one of you.
- I'm exhausted.
- Korean calligraphy?
- Everything hurts. Oh.
* * *
- Here it is. It's starting.
- And this barbershop lives one very special puppy. Meet Sausage.
- This little cutie brings joy to all the customers.
- Here at Bread Barbershop, Sausage is living the dream.
* * *
- Are you kidding me? Why was the entire show about our dog?
- Yeah you know, our network director thinks the dog is real cute.
- So she changed the vibe of the episode.
- Hey, let's do another episode sometime.
- I won't! You butter-headed ninny.
- You're a star. Everyone loves our little Sausage. That's my boy.
- Sure he is.
