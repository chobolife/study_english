# Hello Sausage

- Where did this filthy strike come from? Get lost! Don't you dare give my sebastian fleas?
* * *
- Working really hard is my quest. I'm gonna do my dairy best.
- Oh goodness! Wait. You gotta get out of there.
- Wow. You're cute. I'm Wilk, and what's your name?
- Oh you're hungry, huh? Hang on.
- There, you can have some fresh milk. Drink up.
- Oh, you're a hungry little pooch, huh? Hey, I know you should come back with me to the barbershop. We have food there.
- I know for sure Master Bread will like you.

- No way.
- Sir, poor Sausage doesn't have anywhere else to go.
- No pets allowed in the barbershop.
- Master, please.
- I'm real sorry, Sausage.
- My boss said we can't keep you in the barbershop at all.
- No, Sausage...

- There, you can stay in here from now on, okay?
- I can't let my boss find out, okay?
* * *
- Hmm? Wilk, can you grab me more cream? Wilk?
- Where is that kid?
- Wilk, are you down here?
- What is going on?
- Wilk!!!

- Master Bread! It's my fault sir. Please don't kick poor Sausage out.
- I'm not. I'm kicking you both out.
- Please forgive me this once, sir.

- Oh my crust, aren't you the cutest little thing?
- Does this cute pup live in the shop?
- Wow, he's so great.
- Is it okay if I take a picture with your dog?
- I...
- Of course ma'am, of course.
- Oh, Sausage here he's the mascot of our shop, right? Please take a picture as many as you'd like.
- Thanks so much.
- Sir...?
- And if you upload the picture, I'll give you a discount.
- That's so cool! This place is awesome.
