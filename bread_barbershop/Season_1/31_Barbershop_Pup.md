# Barbershop Pup

- Wow, Choco. We got to the office at the same time, twinsies.
- What a small world.
- Good morning, Sausage.
***
- Eat up buddy.
- You have such a good life. All you have to do is play around and eat.
- You're telling me. We pick up his poop he lives here rent-free gives us nothing.
- Not quite. In return he gives us enjoyment by being cute.
- Please, I hope I'm a Sausage in my next life.
***
- Mommy jam baby jam daddy jam. oh, no wait.
- This one should be mommy jam, or is it uncle jam.
- No, no, you look good with banana hair.
- Baby jam, what do you think?
- Wilk, whipped cream. Wilk?
- The real question is which one of you is the grandpa jam.
- Sausage, can you give me a minute? I'm doing important things.
***
- That's it, Wilk. You're fired. Now get lost.
- Master Bread, no!
***
- Wilk.
- Strawberry, blueberry, chocolate.
- Finished. Tata.
- Oh, nice. You really are a genius barber.
- Being the best is tricky work.
- Sausage, what are you so tired for? You don't work.
***
- Oh, man. I can't see anything.
***
- Choco, here's the stuff from storage you needed.
- All right. Thanks.
***
- Yay, lunch time.
- Uh, who's in charge of cooking lunch?
- Me, me. We're having curry rice.
- Oh, I could use that.
- Time to make a yummy lunch.
***
- Hmm... I wonder how I can jazz up the same old thing?
- Instead of curry, I'll use caramel to make lunch extra sweet.
- I know Master Bread likes his spicy stuff. So this ghost pepper ought to do the trick.
- Carrots are boring. Let's throw in some gummy bears.
- Mushroom? Ugh. More like marshmallow, right?
- All done. I'll just wait for that to boil.
***
- Lunch is served.
- Oh, this isn't bad.
- It tastes kind of sweet.
- It's my top secret curry recipe. The secret is caramel.
- No way. It's subtle.
- Milk's a better cook than I'd have thought.
- Sausage, you should eat up. I'm good at cooking. One day I might teach you.
***
- I can't. Why can't I balance these accounts? Ugh. I need to clear my head.
***
- Choco, why isn't this done?
- Because it's really hard to do. You try getting it done.
- Hey, I'm your boss.
- Oh, yeah? Bite me.
***
- Huh, everything's balanced now? Did I read it the wrong way?
***
- Whoa, it's time to go home.
- See you all tomorrow.
- Likewise hasta banana.
- Sausage, goodbye.
***
- Choco, we got here at the same time again. Twins.
- Amazing.
- Sausage, how are you?
- Wilk, put some tea on, will you?
- This place would come to a screeching halt without me.
- You're such a lucky dog. You just get to play all day.
- Yes sir, on my way.
