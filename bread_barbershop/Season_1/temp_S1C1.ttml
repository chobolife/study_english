chippy customer
[Music]
wow i thought this place would be
fancier but
turns out it's kind of a dub welcome to
our shop how can we help you today
how long do i gotta wait for a haircut
the wait is about an
hour right now an hour i don't have that
long to wait
we have been here a while i've been here
for like two hours
i apologize everyone sometimes it just
takes a bit of time to get the best
haircut for you
don't give me those half-baked excuses
this place should be ashamed of itself
and here's your receipt
30 bucks for fresh whipped cream 50 just
for fruit topping
this place reeks of a scam that does
seem steep
i have to choose between a haircut or my
phone bill
well we only use high quality
ingredients and those can be pricier
high quality oh crust how are we
supposed to know that's real
i've never seen a shop that costs this
much with this long await
if i were you i'd go someplace that
valued my time and money not this dumb
[Music]
i mean some of what he said is not wrong
but i thought this place was supposed to
be the best
should we try to find a new barber shop
morning master brad come look
something's gone wrong
what do you mean huh what's this
hello everyone this is bakery x-files
i'm croissant
bread barber shop has long been known as
the best salon in town
[Music]
orange taco morning bread
but our exclusive look reveals high
rising prices
and crummy service sometimes it just
takes a bit of time to get the best
haircut for you
if you don't like it go somewhere else
um i don't remember saying that they
charge far more than the average salon
ripping off unsuspecting customers we
only use high quality ingredients
or not that's just what we tell
customers so they give us
all their cash
that's fake this is slander someone's
just trying to bring
us down hey will where'd you get that oh
this
huh the new hair salon across the street
is giving away snacks
huh it's it's that nasty chip who came
in here yesterday
he's the one behind all this i'm sure
the nerve
child and expensive haircuts don't want
to wait too long for that new
dew come on down the potato chip hair

cream every morning but
this seems a lot more convenient wilk

huh this stuff expired ages ago
what are you serious and it's not just
the cream
this fruit he's using is rotten and
stale
with all this mess it's no wonder the
flies gather around this place
what a shady thing to do hmm
hey it's the remote control for the
machine that does the hair
it looks like this button turns it on
wow that thing goes real fast if only we
had a machine like this in our shop
no way it can speed up even more well
stop that
well please help me
this is not my friend definitely the
plunger we use for our toilet
ear pick tweezers please don't tell me
he's using these dirty tools for hair
we should take pics as evidence
i don't know how he can get away with
this we should tell everyone his shop is
gross well are you all right
huh it
it can't be
it's not a potato chip can just a big
trash can
he turned a trash can into a hair salon
that's the one found in bathrooms right

for evidence

a home for wilk
[Music]
i feel almost curdled after that long
day time for sleep
huh hello oh
i hope i'm not interrupting anything uh
landlady bread what's the matter i could
have sworn i paid rent this month
well it is related to that things are
getting expensive these days young man
the price of real estate just goes up
you know that's why your rent has to go
up again
what that's not fun when my salary stays
the same
how much is the rent going up not very
much at all
just a thousand dollars a thousand new
you should be grateful i'm not doubling
it like other landlords but then
i'm afraid that's just too much money
for me to pay you my word how do you
expect me to keep up in today's economy
get it together but i i can't afford to
live here
so move somewhere else it's no
difference to me
lady can't hear the sounds of whining
one thousand one thousand dollars more
i get paid 1 500 after rent
food city bus bills and anything fun
like donut ranger movies and everything
else i gotta pay
i barely get by but another thousand
no even i know that math doesn't work oh
no
this is bad i'm done for well
who beat you up my
rent's going up she said a thousand
dollars increase
a thousand you sure she didn't say a
hundred it's true
she said a thousand bucks for sure
where will i find that money
why not just move to a new place i'm
sure you can find someplace cheaper
around
my place so full of unforgettable
memories i want to cherish
so silly you know memories won't keep
food on the table right
i guess i really have to move
hello sir welcome to half-baked realty
for all your moving needs
now how can i be of help to you i need a
new home
someplace cheap but with a barbecue and
a pool
no you're asking far too much you can
only pick one
cheap or good is that so
oh however i'm sure we can find
something that works for your needs
there's one on the market that's both
cheap and good
tada here it is your home wow
huh but
i thought you said this place was good
that's true
the bathroom's a quarter mile from the
bedroom great for exercise
exercise is good so this house is
definitely good
i don't know you and i might have
different definitions of the word
good this just won't work do you have
anything else
the next one is cheap and also great
there's just one little flaw
is this another version of good i know
it's just a little
far away oh that's not bad at all
i'll just leave for work earlier
mr wilk we're almost there
great and how soon yeah just another
four or five hours left to go for
hours but we've already been driving for
four hours already
is this place in a whole different town
it's still in bakery town it's the outer
suburbs
living out in the country might be good
for you
huh bring me back to the city i'm not
ready to
[Music]
so which definition of good is this one
very good
i guarantee you're gonna like this next
house here's the place

we'll care how's it going forgot to tell
you one tiny detail
the teensy problem with the place
problem
it's super plus i'm at the landlord ah
yeah there is no landlord huh that place
has been haunted for years
the ghosts like to pretend to be your
landlord
[Laughter]
[Music]
i'll never have a home so many places
but none for a broke milk carton
please don't be sad wilk i know we can
find you a home with a good
positive mindset easy for you you're not
the one without a home
each house is either weird haunted or a
million miles out
well there is still one more place we
haven't seen yet
yeah it's uh listed as unique which we
can work around
but i guess it couldn't hurt to take a
look
well let's head inside after you
yes i know the location is right in the
middle of town which is why it's so
small
i shouldn't have even brought you we can
go somewhere else
this is it this is the place i've been
waiting for
it's so convenient too wake up here
watch my face here
brush my teeth take a poop and then
clean up another doodoo then go to sleep
ah everything all at once you should
have shown me this house before all the
other ones
what does it cost it's uh 500
a month 500 yay i'm
in i want to sign right now
that long search paid off in the end
this new house is just right for a
little milk box

different from mother milk boxes

seen this
however i'm afraid nothing can be done
about it
i'm sorry
hey nerd go ahead and take your hat off
i heard his milk gets filled with a w
instead just take off the hat it's not
like hiding it will fix
it he's got a point
i'm the same as you guys mine says milk
too take it off if that's true
his letter's upside down that's red so
all the rumors were right
milk's first letter is upside down
[Laughter]
