# Buffer Fingers

- Do you happen to know how to spell menu?
- Menu?
- Because I think it's spelled like me and you.
- Oh Butter. I...
- Cut, cut, cut! Butter! Again! You slipped off the scene again.
- I'm so sorry sir. Really.
* * *
- You know if you were a fruit, you'd be a fine apple.
- Oh my!
- Cut. You slipped again.
- Someone call an ambulance.
* * *
- Listen Butter. Every time you slip up, we lose precious filming time. Maybe you just not cut off a movie.
- It's a shame someone so handsome can't act.
- I told the director he should have hired margarine instead.
* * *
- Do you want skin as shiny as mine? Moisturize with canola cream.
- What a handsome guy! If only I could have his looks for one day.
- Please he's not that great. Back in my day I was a handsome loaf. Way better than this guy.
- I heard Butter can't act, and that's why they haven't stuck doing commercials.
- That can't be! Nobody that handsome could be bad at anything at all. Those rumors aren't real.
- Whatevs.
- Is this the shop of Bread Barber?
* * *
- No way! It's him! Master Bread. It's Butter the one and only!
- Oh wow. Is it really you sir? You're even handsomer in real life.
- That sugary sweet gays. Perfectly sculpted nose. Million what smile. It's just not fair that some people are born this way.
- But why did you even come here? You can't possibly be improved.
- Ah you're too kind. It's nothing like that at all.
- You hush. There's plenty of things to fix. Hey you made the right decision coming in here today. Now what can I do for you? Make yourself comfortable.
- Good crust. He's perfect. Wilk was right. He can't be improved.
- Let's not waste time. You tell me exactly what it is you need me to do. Okay? Which hideous part of you do you hate the most?
- It's... I can't act because I have butterfingers.
- That isn't any reason to shed tears. It'll be fine. Because I'll make sure you never let anything slip through your hands again.
- Oh you would? If you could really fix that, I would owe you my entire career.
- I'm such a slippery fool.
- Please don't cry. If you get sad, then what up do the rest of us commenters have to be happy?
- Both of you hush up, now!
- How to make something that has more grip? Aha! Wilk, go get me the powdered sugar.
- Okay.
* * *
- Hold up. The sugars are coating so you won't slip as much.
- But now he's as pale as a ghost. He's straight out of a nightmare.
- Nightmare?
- Master Bread. Surely there's something else we can do?
- Hmm got it. Wilk, go get me some fishnet stockings.
- Okay.
- Oh this stuff worked. I don't feel slippery anymore.
- See how easy that was told you.
- But uh. But... The love scene... What am I supposed to do in one of those?
- Oh.
- There. No slip.
- But sir. We shouldn't have to cover up his face you know. He looks like a cheap burglar.
- I don't want to cover up my face. Flaunted if you got it is what they say. Isn't there something else we can do?
- Hmm I thought that would work. Ah yes. Wilk, go fix the honey jar from the third shelf.
- Uh honey? If you say so.
* * *
- Wow.
- Master, That's so cool. Plus, he's got a nice tan now.
- Don't celebrate too soon. Here, try to shake my hand.
- Uh. Of course.
- Please work. Look at that! Master Bread. It really works!
- Oh My! Can I really be grabbing your hand right? Now I can't believe it doesn't slip at all.
- Well it looks like we're done. When you leave here today you'll have a whole new lease on life, a whole new you. And you should change your name.
- Honey Butter. Your star is on the rise.
- Honey Butter? That's amazingly cool. Thank you. Thank you so much.
- How about a group photo before you go and pay?
- Ah. Okay of course.
- Me too, me too.
* * *
- I could have saved his career. Now it's just scandals.
