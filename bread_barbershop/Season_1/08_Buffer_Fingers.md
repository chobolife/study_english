Do you happen to know how to spell menu?
Menu?
Because I think it's spelled like me and you.
Oh butter. I...
Cut, cut, cut! Again! Butter! You slipped off the scene again
I'm so sorry sir. Really
* * *
You know if you were a fruit, huh you'd be a fine apple
Oh my! god!
* * *
Listen butter every time you slip up we lose precious filming time
Maybe you just not cut off a movie
* * *
it's a shame someone so handsome can't
act I told the director he should have hired margaret
* * *
do you want skin as shiny as mine? moisturize with canola cream
what a handsome guy if only I could have his looks for one day
please he's not that great. back in my day I was a handsome loaf.  way better than this guy
I heard butter can't act and that's why they haven't stuck doing commercials
that can't be! nobody that handsome could be bad at anything at all
those rumors aren't real whatevs
is this the shop of red barber?
* * *
no way! it's him! master bread. it's butter the one and only!
oh wow is it really you sir? you're even handsomer in real life
that sugary sweet gays. perfectly sculpted nose. million what smile. it's just not fair that some people are born this way.
but why did you even come here you can't possibly be improved.
ah you're too kind it's nothing like that at all.
you hush there's plenty of things to fix. hey you made the right decision coming in here today. now what can I do for you?
make yourself comfortable. um good crust. he's perfect. luke was right he can't be improved.
let's not waste time you tell me exactly
what it is you need me to do okay
which hideous part of you do you hate the most.
it's I can't act because I have butterfingers
that isn't any reason to shed tears it'll be fine. because I'll make sure you never let anything slip through your hands again
oh you would? if you could really fix that, I would owe you my entire career.
I'm such a slippery fool
please don't cry. if you get sad, then what up do the rest of us commenters have to be happy.
both of you hush up, now!
how to make something that has more grip? aha!
wilt go get me the powdered sugar.

* * *
hold up the sugars are coating so you won't slip as much.
