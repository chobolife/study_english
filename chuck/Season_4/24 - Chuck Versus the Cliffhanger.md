# Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger

- Hi I'm Chuck.
- Here are a few things that you might need to know.
- There was an Intersect before Chuck?
- Ellie: Dad used this program to input a new identity into an operative, but once he went undercover, something went wrong.
- The program took over.
- Chuck: Agent X is Alexei Volkoff?
- The CIA created one of the most m*rder men in the history of the world.
- You know what happens if they find out we know?
- They order a guy like me to put a b*llet in each one of our heads.
- Riley: The Norseman device.
- It can k*ll a sing person in the middle of a crowd with 100% accuracy.
- God, what is that noise?
- Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, no, no, no, no, no, help me!
- (guests gasping)
- You awake?
- Are you thinking about the wedding?
- It's exactly one week away, one single, solitary week.
- Chuck, what if it rains?
- That's good luck, right?
- Well, what if it doesn't?
- Are we freaking out? We're freaking out.
- That's normal, though, it's normal to freak out a little bit a week before a wedding.
- Unless...
- It's cold feet?
- No, no, no, because I want to marry you.
- I really want to marry you, too.
- It's just the church and exchanging intimate feelings in front of a crowd.
- Wait, what if we did a dry run?
- A dry run? Yeah, yeah, a dry run, you know, that way we can work out the kinks-- no people, no cameras.
- Practice makes...
- Perfect.
- We'll be ready for anything.
- Chuck: The poison is called thorium.
- I don't know much about it other than seeing it k*ll a room full of men.
- Thorium is a radioactive metal, not a poison.
- Was it liquid or solid?
- Liquid, yellowish.
- It's linked to her DNA somehow.
- Then the thorium's been synthesized.
- Devon, do you have any ideas?
- Poison g*n aren't in the textbooks. She's burning up.
- I need a bath basin stat.
- Hypothermia will decrease the heart rate and hopefully slow down any tissue damage.
- Chuck, if she's going to survive the next 24 hours, we need to know exactly how this poison works.
- And if it's exotic like you're saying, we need to find an antidote.
- Okay, I told everybody at the party that she had food poisoning and that she's going to be fine.
- (grunts)
- She's going to be fine, right?
- SARAH (weakly): Chuck.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey, baby, hi, I'm right here.
- You look worried.
- No, you know, it's just, just wedding stuff.
- Don't freak out.
- We're ready for it.
- Sarah.
- Baby, I'm going to fix this.
- We're going to get married and be together forever.
- I love you.
- There's only one person who can get us that antidote, and it's the man who made the damn thing.
- Hmm.
- Volkoff.
- Well, Volkoff's in a super max penitentiary.
- It'd take weeks to get clearance.
- Well, then, I guess we're just going to have to break in tonight.
- There. Mom, we've reached Volkoff's cell.
- Copy that, Chuck, you have precisely two minutes before the alarm system comes back up.
- Already open.
- That's not right.
- Casey, where is Volkoff?
- (over intercom) MAN : He's gone, Agent Bartowski.
- Stay where you are.
- Chuck, what is going on in there?
- I know that voice.
- Casey, you're going pale.
- I go pale, you don't go pale.
- Remember when I told you opening up the Agent X files would draw out a remorseless son of a bitch that would destroy our whole team without breaking a sweat?
- This is the guy they hire to k*ll that guy.
- Agent Bartowski, Colonel Casey.
- Chuck: Listen, pal, I don't know who you are and frankly I don't care.
- I need Volkoff to save Sarah Walker's life.
- Now, where is he?
- Name's Decker, Clyde Decker, and I'm informing you of a wash order on the Agent X program and Operation Bartowski.
- What does that mean?
- It means your CIA resources are revoked.
- But Sarah is dying.
- I don't care!
- Now, stand down or get buried.
- No.
- No?
- Let me explain.
- (alarm blaring)
- That guy might think he's a hard-ass, but I'm the Intersect.
- Let's move.

Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger
Original Air Date on May 16, 2011
- Chuck. ?
- CHUCK (over phone): Any news?
- Sarah's temperature is down, but it's not stabilizing.
- What does that mean, El?
- Well, there's signs of a total- body dose of radiation.
- She's breathing on her own, but she's in and out of consciousness.
- How long does she have?
- At this rate, I would say that she has 12 hours.
- Casey: She's here.
- Thanks for helping us, General.
- Decker is transporting Volkoff to a black site outside Phoenix.
- No one who's gone in has ever come out.
- We need to intercept Volkoff in transit.
- They're on the 10 East an hour ahead of you.
- Well, then, we need something with speed.
- Can we still get into Castle?
- Chuck, you realize, if you go against Decker, you're going against the CIA.
- You and Sarah will have to disappear forever.
- You'll never see your family again.
- I'll do anything I need to do to save Sarah.
- This should work.
- Casey: So what's the bright idea, Chuck?
- And why are you keeping us in the dark?
- I want the Nighthawk.
- Absolutely not.
- A prototype-- never been tested.
- 11 hours and counting-- I don't give a damn.
- ♪ ♪
- You're not even supposed to know about the Nighthawk.
- Come on, you thought you could keep a super bike secret from me?
- She'll do 250 on the highway.
- You two will navigate from Castle.
- Chuck, have you ever even ridden a motorcycle?
- And I hope to God the answer is no.
- ♪ ♪
- Mary: Charles, I know time is of the essence, but you are driving awfully fast.
- Sorry, Mom.
- Don't get all icy on me, Volkoff.
- I come in peace.
- This transfer is not about k*ll you.
- CIA wants you for some testing, that's all.
- Testing?
- Regarding Agent X.
- You playing coy or you don't remember any of this?
- Casey, Casey, I'm coming up on the transport.
- Your real name is Hartley Winterbottom.
- (laughs)
- Nobody names a person that.
- Volkoff is a fictitious profile you created with Stephen J. Bartowski.
- What on earth are you talking about?
- Tech boys wanted you sans Volkoff, so...
- do svidaniya, Alexei.
- (groaning)
- Casey, Mom, light it up.
- Hold tight.
- (over comms) MAN: We're under attack.
- Volkoff has been breached. Need backup.
- Casey: Chuck, you have 60 seconds to get him out of there.
- They've called in air support.
- (sighs)
- Hey.
- (grunts)
- Come on, wake up.
- You're coming with me.
- I am?
- Why?
- Vivian sh*t Sarah with The Norseman--
- I don't have time to explain everything right now.
- Who sh*t whom with what?
- Bartowski, you are galactically insubordinate.
- I'm almost impressed.
- I'm taking Volkoff with me.
- One problem-- that ain't Volkoff.
- His name's Hartley.
- Volkoff was an Intersect implant.
- It's gone now.
- Hello.
- Gentle as a lamb.
- Give up, Chuck, you're done.
- Um, um, Bartowski.
- Are you related to Stephen Bartowski?
- I'm his son, and you're coming with me right now.
- On that?
- That looks very dangerous.
- I said now!
- You are kidnapping a government prisoner, peckerwood!
- Hang tight.
- Uh-huh.
- (screaming)
- Is he still in charge?
- (chuckles) If only.
- Mary: The Volkoff profile that you and Stephen developed for the Intersect was only supposed to last for a couple months.
- What did I do?
- I mean, what did Volkoff do for 30 years?
- What kind of a man was I?
- You were very successful in a highly competitive business.
- No, Mary.
- There's got to be more to it than that.
- If someone's been struck by The Norseman.
- Hartley, I'm sorry, but we don't have time for this. Okay, please.
- My fiancée has been poisoned by The Norseman, and right now, I need your help to save her life.
- Right, right, The Norseman.
- Um, it was developed alongside the Intersect.
- And it was a w*apon of deterrence.
- They were going to collect the DNA of all the top black marketeers in the world.
- Oh, you could whack 'em if they got out of line.
- That's smart. Reagan smart.
- Yeah. Peace through violence.
- Remember, it was the '80s.
- Hartley, is there an antidote?
- Iridium 5.
- Okay, how-how... how do we get it?
- Oh, it's simple. I can make that for you.
- Great. That's great. That's fantastic.
- We'll talk on the way to the hospital. Let's go.
- Once we secure the antidote, we'll discuss our plans for Viv.
- Viv?
- Yeah, gal named Vivian fired The Norseman on Sarah.
- Which doesn't matter right now. What does is the antidote.
- Charles, who's Vivian?
- It's a Winterbottom family name.
- She's your daughter.
- My daughter?
- And she's your enemy?
- It's a long story.
- Terrible mistakes were made.
- And now we have to clean them up.
- Will you help me save Sarah?
- Yeah. Of course I will.
- Thank you.
- (rhythmic beeping)
- Sarah: Okay, here we go.
- (laughs)
- (laughs)
- (clears throat)
- Okay.
- (clears throat)
- That's all you... That's all you got there?
- I mean, these are our wedding vows, after all, so...
- I think I covered the bases.
- Okay, cool. Yeah, good, good.
- You go, then I'll go, and then we'll have a little note session afterwards.
- Okay. I'm just gonna go...
- You-You go, mm-hmm. (clears throat)
- "Chuck, "you're a gift.
- "You're a gift I never dreamed I could want or need, "and every day, I will show you "that you're a gift that I deserve.
- "You make me the best person I could ever hope to be, "and I want to spend and learn and love the rest of my life with you. "
- Talky?
- Perfect.
- So perfect. So perfect. Oh, my God.
- Sarah. Oh, Sarah.
- Oh, mine are a tear-down.
- This is a page one rewrite.
- I scripted a wardrobe change.
- You know, and a pause for applause.
- Chuck, don't freak out.
- Whatever they are, they will be perfect.
- Ellie: Something's wrong.
- The Iridium slowed the spread of the poison, but her temperature is creeping back up.
- What are we talking about?
- (sighs) I think that you bought more time, but she's still deteriorating.
- (monitor beeping)
- Okay, okay. Okay, what's next?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't... ?
- Come on. Come on, people, think. Think about this.
- If there's an Iridium 5, there's got to be an Iridium 6, right?
- (sighs)
- About four years ago, Volkoff was working on a new compound.
- Very secret.
- File was labeled "Lead Apron. "
- Which is a way to protect against radioactive poisoning.
- Volkoff must have known that...
- No, must have known that number five was weak, and developed the next stage antidote, Iridium 6.
- Mary: Volkoff kept the project close, at his Moscow base.
- El, what's our time frame?
- A day, maybe less.
- And we're out of here ASAP.
- I still have friends in Global Strike Command.
- They'll be happy to give us a free jump to Russia.
- They love mixing it up with the Reds.
- Decker: Bartowski!
- (g*n cocking)
- g*n. You may be the Intersect, boy, but you can't outrun a b*llet.
- (sighs)
- (grunting)
- (electrical humming, groaning)
- Mary: Chuck!
- (grunting)
- So, of course, Chuck goes marching back to these bullies, and he demands them to give me back my pants.
- Says he's gonna call the Intergalactic Firestorm Federation, which, by the way, doesn't exist.
- There's no such thing.
- Chuck just, you know, made it up on the spot, but, uh, he got me my pants back.
- You know, I love those pants.
- Anyway, long story just to say that...
- Chuck never gives up.
- You know that already.
- (monitor beeping)
- (Chuck panting)
- (grunting)
- (panting)
- What are you doing?
- Sarah's dying!
- I'm aware of that.
- You're aware of that? I can save her. Please.
- She's CIA, just like you, Decker.
- Let me go get the antidote.
- One last mission. That's all I'm asking for.
- You're fired, Chuck.
- As of... right now.
- Operation Bartowski is done.
- The Buy More is for sale.
- Fine. Fine. Fire me. Just let me go.
- Chuck, there is one last thing I need from you.
- Some CIA property.
- What is that?
- A suppression device.
- They say it only hurts... a lot.
- (gasps)
- What... ?
- (creaking) No. No, no, no, no, no!
- Don't take the Intersect! I need it for the antidote.
- I need it to save Sarah!
- I know, Chuck. I know.
- No!
- (whirring and squealing)
- (grunts)
- No!
- (static crackling, various voices, shouts)
- What do you want, Clyde?
- You're going to convince Agent Bartowski and his mom that this is over.
- No one can know the true origin of Alexei Volkoff.
- Hmm?
- Uncuff him.
- John, I don't need to threaten you to follow an order.
- You're a Marine.
- Now, you're going to do this to protect the greater good.
- Your country.
- Hmm.
- I'm onto you.
- You know I'm not gonna bail out on Walker.
- You think I'm just gonna accept your offer, try to escape with Frost and Chuck.
- But it's a setup.
- And when I make my move, you k*ll us all.
- In the report, you make yourself out to be the good guy, right?
- A real hero.
- It's all right.
- See... John...
- (sighs)
- ... I'm not afraid... to be the bad guy.
- Neither am I.
- (grunting)
- (alarm blaring)
- (beeps, whoosh)
- Hey, Casey, what's up?
- We're making our move.
- Does the CIA still have a man on you?
- Yes. Yes, they do.
- Well, take him out now!
- Meet me back at the apartment.
- Yes, sir. Okay, all right.
- (beeps, whooshing)
- What's going on?
- We're getting Chuck and Hartley out of here.
- Your mom and I are the magnet.
- We're gonna stay here and distract Decker.
- You two get out in the confusion.
- It's the only way you'll make it to Moscow.
- But Casey, they took the Intersect out of me.
- Shut up. You're Chuck Bartowski, the second best spy I've ever worked with.
- Now you're gonna go save the best one.
- I-I'm sorry. What am I supposed to do?
- You and Chuck need to break into Volkoff Industries.
- There'll be lots of security there, so, you'll have to go as your old self.
- Of course, as Volkoff.
- Yes, but he's not you.
- He's a mean, dictatorial, conniving...
- Manipulative, amoral...
- Limey with relatively good teeth.
- Sounds like I was a monster.
- All: You were.
- And you didn't tell me this for a reason?
- My daughter.
- I made her into me?
- (alarms blaring)
- I made her into Volkoff.
- I'm sorry, Hartley.
- Hey, guys, guys, we have a situation.
- All right, we need to take out this CIA guard at the end of the hall.
- What? Dude, we don't do that kind of thing.
- Wait. Morgan, is he dangerous?
- Yes. Yes, very.
- Devon, take him out.
- Wait. What? No. I'm standing right here.
- Okay, I'm the professional spy.
- Devon will go and distract this guard.
- I will be the one doing the taking out.
- Little spy maneuver we like to call "the magnet. "
- So, what, you're gonna punch him out?
- Mm. I don't know. Probably sweep the leg.
- Haven't decided. I like to improvise.
- (beeping)
- Move. Up.
- Chuck?
- New identities. Untraceable.
- Extremely rare.
- I made them years ago for an occasion just like this.
- Mary: You have to use them, Chuck.
- You and Sarah need to disappear.
- Got it.
- Casey, if I never...
- You get the antidote, you get it to Sarah, then disappear.
- You do whatever it takes, you save her.
- Am I ever gonna see you again, Mom?
- Not if everything goes right.
- Good-bye, Chuck.
- I love you.
- Come on, come on.
- All right, Morgan, sweep the leg.
- Or karate chop.
- Or roundhouse kick.
- Or running... Or, uh...
- Or, uh...
- (grunts)
- (mouthing)
- You are supposed to be the magnet.
- Dude, sweep the leg?
- Come on.
- In real life, you just make a fist and you hit him as hard as you can.
- You got lucky.
- (beeping)
- (sighs)
- So this is it--
- Volkoff Industries.
- It's, uh... very stark.
- Charles, do you think this suit is a bit much?
- T-Too much sheen?
- Remember, Hartley, you are Alexei Volkoff, okay?
- Don't think about the suit.
- Just say as little as possible and we'll be fine.
- Think angry thoughts.
- Um, actually, my mind has just gone blank.
- I think I've forgotten the plan again.
- Simply approach the receptionist and tell her in a very bold and Volkoffian way, you are here to see Vivian.
- She'll lead us to your private elevator.
- Once inside the elevator, I'll slip into the air shaft, go to the lab. (sighs)
- I can't do it.
- No, you have to do it. No, I'm not this man, I'm a scientist.
- Your plan is not going to work, Charles.
- Listen to me, it will work.
- My plans always work, I promise.
- But you're not the spy you used to be and I'm not the villain I used to be.
- We can't do this.
- Damn it, we can.
- If we work together, we can.
- What is it, what is going on?
- What if she's up there?
- My daughter.
- This is about Vivian?
- I don't know her.
- W-What do you say to a daughter you've never even met?
- "I'm so sorry I've ruined your life"?
- No, no.
- I'm sorry, I can't see her.
- I'm gonna run away now.
- No, Hart-- wait!
- (receptionist speaking Russian)
- Can I help you?
- My name is Charles Car-- Chuck Bartowski, and I'm here to see Vivian Volkoff.
- And what is this in regard to?
- She wants to k*ll me.
- (g*n cocking)
- I don't believe it.
- Charles Carmichael.
- I'm impressed.
- Walking into my office unarmed-- bold... stupid but bold.
- Sarah is still alive.
- How can that be?
- It doesn't matter. What matters is that I need a vial of the antidote iridium-6.
- Your father stored it here and I need it.
- You need it.
- Please, I'm pleading with you.
- I am here to plead for Sarah's life.
- What's the trick, Chuck?
- What's the clever plan that gets you out of this?
- I'm all out of plans.
- The woman that I love is dying and all I can do is hope that you haven't totally become this person.
- (grunts)
- Everything that you have ever said was done to manipulate me.
- You told me my father was a monster and now you tell me he's someone else, some sort of hero?
- Hartley: I wouldn't say hero.
- Bloody fool, more like.
- I signed on for a mission simply 'cause they needed a scientist, and then I convinced his father, my friend Stephen, to let me use his computer program to help me.
- How did you get in here?
- Oh, I just asked to be shown to my office.
- Everyone was really nice.
- They, they all jumped up to help me.
- I guess I must have been a harsh boss.
- And father.
- I'm so sorry.
- You're sorry?
- You made me your succession plan.
- This was my grandmother's.
- Her name was Vivian.
- She rode horses... and she looked just like you.
- Don't you see, Vivian?
- You're a good person and you come from a good family.
- You've fallen into the wrong world, the wrong life, but this isn't you.
- You're not a k*ll.
- I k*ll Sarah in cold bl*od.
- But you haven't, you haven't yet, there's still time.
- You can give me the antidote and I can save her.
- No.
- I have to be Volkoff now!
- I am this building, I am this company.
- I can never leave, I can never go back.
- (panting quietly)
- What if you could?
- How?
- These are blank identities.
- They're very rare and they're very clean.
- You'd have to give up Volkoff Industries, but if you take these, you can start over anywhere in the world, both of you.
- But Charles... h-how are you going to escape?
- It doesn't matter, okay? ! The only thing that matters is saving Sarah at this point.
- Hartley: Vivian, I don't know you, but I'd like to.
- If you pull that trigger... you'll lose yourself forever like I did.
- You can still change.
- Please, will you help me?
- My brother is cutting it close.
- Whole place is surrounded by Decker's men.
- Chuck's never going to be able to get in there.
- No, he'll have a plan.
- Chuck will come up with something.
- What the hell?
- Sorry we're late, Morgan.
- Egypt took longer than we thought.
- Not a problem, ladies, thank you for coming.
- I called Sarah's bridesmaids as soon as their plane landed.
- Don't give me any grief, Casey, we're here for Sarah.
- Glad you're here.
- Meet Mary the mother-in-law.
- Hi.
- (over radio) MAN: We have a signal.
- Repeat that. What did you say?
- Something's approaching by air.
- I have the antidote.
- Let me in.
- Get him out of here.
- Casey: Hey!
- Decker, let him in!
- Thanks for coming, guys.
- You're welcome, Chuck.
- Hey, let him in, douche.
- You're all under arrest.
- Kind of disappointed in you, Bartowski.
- You thought you could get past me with a few of your spy friends?
- You should have known I'd bring an army to stop you.
- I know the move... but we have a move of our own.
- It's called the magnet.
- See, while you're busy looking at me and all of my spy friends, you're missing something really, really big, care of Volkoff Industries. (whooshing)

- You're just a pawn. You always were.
- What are you talking about?
- You think it was all a coincidence?
- The Intersect, FULCRUM, the Ring, Shaw, Agent X?
- That's all just part of the plan, Bartowski.
- Pieces on the puzzle board.
- See you never, civilian.
- Wait, wait, wait. What plan?
- Huh? What plan?
- My life was changed forever.
- My friends were put in danger.
- My family...
- My father was k*ll, Decker.
- (laughs)
- (static)
- A plan? Sounds more like a conspiracy.
- Question is, who could control our lives so well?
- I don't know. We've been racking our brains.
- Ah, it doesn't matter anyway.
- It's not our fight.
- You forget the CIA fired our asses.
- Okay, well, what if we went into business for ourselves?
- And how exactly would we do that?
- Well, we have a base, and the Buy More has proven to be an excellent cover.
- Morgan: Uh, Mrs. B?
- One thing. The Buy More just sold.
- Yeah. We know.
- We bought it.
- Sarah: Hartley turned over all of Volkoff's assets to us.
- Wedding present.
- 877... million dollars.
- Although I like to refer to it as a cool billion, just 'cause it's kind of more fun to say.
- Mamacita, that's a lot of money.
- And who better to handle a billion dollars than me?
- Us. Us. Us!
- Our first purchase was the Buy More and everything below it.
- Now we have all of Volkoff's resources at our disposal.
- That's if you guys still want to take out some bad guys.
- Damn right we do. Damn right we do.
- You guys want a job?
- Hell, yeah. Hells, yeah.
- Chuck: Great! I took the liberty of buying us a Gulf Stream and all new tactical equipment.
- We do have to reoutfit Castle, though, so, any ideas?
- Wow. Freelance spies.
- Yes! Men... and women of action and adventure.
- Under the radar, above the law.
- Oh, man, this is gonna be so much fun.
- Just, uh, huh.
- Oh, nice. Slick new gig.
- Slick new shades.
- (laughs)
- What could go wrong?
- Oh.
- (whirring)
- (electronic blipping, various overlapping voices)
- Morgan? Morgan? !
- Morgan?
- (gasps)
- Morgan, did you just... ?
- Guys... I know kung fu.
