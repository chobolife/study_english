# Chuck Versus the Aisle of Terror

- Chuck: I'm Chuck. Here's a couple things you need to know or maybe forgot.
- I have to find the truth, Morgan. Why my mom left and never came back.
- This is my search.
- This is all I could find.
- Chuck: I thought she was a prisoner that needed to be saved.
- Then I come of find out she's just one of the bad guys.
- [RINGS]
- Hello.
- Mary: Hello, Chuck?
- It's your mother.
- What are you doing back here? This is a secured area.
- Oh. Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. I was just looking for the, uh, fitness center.
- I'll just be on my way, then.
- You're not going anywhere.
- Show me your security ID.
- No need to be rough, I...
- [GASPING]
- [YELLS]
- What is this?
- I see your hands are shaking.
- [DISTORTED] That means the toxin is taking effect.
- It's flooding your brain now... turning your entire consciousness into one gigantic nightmare.
- The only difference, this nightmare you never wake up from.
- [GROWLS]
- [YELLING]
- As you can see, my toxin is fully functional.
- Impressive, isn't it?
- Mary: Very impressive, Dr. Wheelwright.
- I believe I have a buyer in Los Angeles who will be very interested in this.
- [RINGING]
- Hello.
- Mary: Hello, Chuck. It's your mother.
- I want to see you, in person.
- Is this a joke?
- Mary: Griffith Park. One hour.
- Is this... Is this a joke, Mom?
- You have any idea how long I've been looking for you... these last couple of months? Where have you been since I was 9?
- Mary: Chuck, now is not the time. Just meet me.
- Tell no one. Come alone.
- Okay, bye.
- Hey. Ellie's putting out dessert.
- If you don't come in soon, I'm gonna eat yours and blame it on Morgan.
- What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost.
- I just talked to one.
- [COYOTE HOWLS]
- [CELL PHONE RINGING]
- Had a feeling you wouldn't show up. I guess I should have expected it.
- MARY [OVER PHONE]: Look to your 3 o'clock.
- I had to make sure you came alone.
- I did everything you asked. Why all the secrecy?
- You've been working for Volkoff. Afraid the bad guys will see you with your son?
- Oh, it's much more complicated than that, Chuck.
- Meet me at the playground.
- Uh...
- You just hate saying goodbye like a normal person, don't you?
- Okay, Chuck, I'm in position.
- [g*n COCKS]
- And who are you?
- Wow.
- I didn't even hear a twig snap.
- You must have been doing this for a long time.
- You're calling me old?
- Not old.
- Just slow.
- Government-issued sidearm.
- What are you? CIA? FBI?
- My story is not as interesting as yours, so we'll start with you first.
- Why did Volkoff send you here?
- Oh, jumping to conclusions, are we?
- Oh, I think my conclusions are pretty justified.
- I am here because I need to see...
- Hey, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey there. How you guys doing?
- You brought someone. I told you to come alone.
- No, no, no, technically not just someone, okay?
- Mom, this is my girlfriend, Sarah.
- Sarah, this is my mom, Mary.
- I don't know how to say this exactly, but please don't k*ll each other.
- Great, great, see? I can see the connection already.
- BFF Facebook buddies.
- I'll shut up now.
- Did you think he wouldn't come alone?
- I thought maybe he would trust me.
- Okay, considering that you left me when I was, oh, I don't know, 9 years old... and I don't know if you're good or bad, I have every right to have... a mother issue or two right now.
- You're right.
- You are absolutely right.
- Thank you. No sh**ting necessary, none whatsoever.
- Great, good. Here we go, fully hanging out.
- What should we do? Sit down?
- I know a wonderful bakery...
- Chuck.
- Or we could just hang out here in a creepy dark playground.
- Where to start? Ooh, ooh, I know.
- I got a story. Tenth birthday. You haven't even heard this one.
- I ate so much chocolate cake, frosting came out my nose.
- I could smell it for a year after.
- Chuck, Chuck, stop.
- I don't wanna know anything about you.
- Excuse me?
- I am deep undercover in the Volkoff organization.
- And if my cover is blown, they will torture me for secrets.
- I don't wanna know about you or your sister that could put you in danger.
- So just leave it at that.
- You're undercover?
- That's funny because we didn't find any files on you in the CIA database.
- No, you wouldn't.
- When I went undercover, my records were expunged.
- That's convenient.
- Then how do we know that you're not making this up?
- Because I brought you this.
- Atroxium, a nerve gas that causes extreme terror in its v*ctim... and within minutes drives them completely insane.
- The scientist, Wheelwright, who created it... wants to meet Volkoff's most trusted w*apon buyer.
- Chuck, I need you to pose as that buyer.
- Atroxium is dangerous, far too dangerous to be on the open market.
- One warhead of this could debilitate an entire army.
- I had to break cover so that I could make sure that the CIA gets hold of this.
- Okay, fine. Why me?
- Because I thought I could trust you.
- Just say you flashed on him.
- That I... ? I'm sorry, what? You know about the Intersect?
- I may not know anything about you... but I know everything there is to know about Charles Carmichael.
- [SIRENS WAILING NEARBY]
- We're done here.
- Set up the meet.
- I'll make sure the CIA gets the nerve gas.
- Goodbye, Chuck.
- Goodbye.
- [WOMAN SCREAMING ON TV]
- Hello. Welcome to the Buy More.
- Stop by this weekend and check out our Halloween Haunted House Spectacular.
- It's gonna be scary. I mean, good scary, like pumpkins and ghosts.
- Not bad scary, like w*r and bears. You know, because I find...
- Oh, good day, sir. Welcome to the Buy More.
- Coming in hot today, aren't you?
- Ah, it's tough.
- Once I turn on the charisma, I can't turn it off. It's my curse.
- Listen, that little incident in Iran showed me something.
- You're either exceptionally smart or incredibly stupid.
- My father used to say the same thing. Without the "smart" part.
- Anyway, the whole situation has me thinking that maybe... you do have something to offer as a spy.
- This is what I've been telling you.
- Come on, Bartowski has something to show us down in the Castle.
- Thanks.
- Sarah, you know I have a huge blind spot with my mom.
- I mean, are we crazy for doing this? Should we even be getting involved?
- I know that you've been looking for answers about your mom.
- And we're gonna find some, okay?
- We just have to be very cautious.
- Thank you.
- Just got your message.
- What's happening?
- Good, you're all here.
- Bartowski, your flash on Wheelwright was 100 percent correct.
- He is currently in Los Angeles to sell the Atroxium...
- I'm sorry, what is Grimes doing here?
- Oh, uh, he's with me. I felt he could be of some use to the team.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
- Apparently, I'm quite the hot commodity in the spy world.
- Morgan Grimes, not just for the ladies anymore. Ha, ha.
- Silence.
- Of course.
- Good. Now we need to focus.
- Atroxium is extremely dangerous.
- Uh, general, Sarah and I were discussing a plan.
- Um, if I pose as the buyer, not only would I be able to get the Atroxium off the market... I could also flash on any Volkoff operatives involved.
- So it's, uh, it's a win-win.
- Very impressive, Bartowski. We'll set up the meet.
- Good work, Chuck.
- Mm.
- I smell a rat.
- I found her. I found my mom.
- What? You found your mom?
- That's fantastic, dude. I am so happy for you.
- Thanks, man. I still can't believe it.
- When? Where?
- She came to me with the Wheelwright info.
- Chuck, your mother works for Volkoff.
- Which is her cover, Casey.
- Chuck: She's legit.
- Better run it by Beckman.
- I've checked and it's a dead end.
- Her CIA credentials were erased to protect her cover.
- Chuck: We have to keep this to ourselves.
- If Beckman goes digging, she could put my mom in danger. Just trust me on this.
- Devon, your two little ladies are home.
- Hey, babe.
- Little babe. How are you doing, huh?
- Ha, ha.
- We rushed home early so we could get a few moments of peace... before your mother makes my life a living...
- Hello.
- Heaven. Ha, ha, it's just a heavenly visit every time she's here.
- Ellie.
- Hi, Honey.
- It's good to see you. What were you doing back there?
- Oh, uh, just a little dusting.
- We have to keep this place clean for my little granddaughter-to-be.
- So I just thought I'd try tidying up a bit.
- As a surprise.
- Surprise.
- Mom has another surprise for us too.
- What?
- She canceled the room we booked for her at the W.
- She's spending the week with us.
- The whole week?
- That's... That's great.
- I know, I can't believe it either.
- Oh, here, let me take that from you.
- Okay.
- Okay. Are you sure you're okay with this?
- Because if not, I can bite the b*llet and I can ask her to stay at the hotel.
- Uh...
- Mm, no, you don't have to do that. She should stay.
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah.
- I felt the baby kick on the way home.
- Oh, my God, really?
- Yeah. It's starting to feel so real, you know?
- I'm gonna be a mom.
- Mm-hm.
- I don't know how to be a mom.
- Of course you do.
- Your mother and I aren't best friends, but it might be nice to have her around.
- I could use a little motherly advice.
- I'll go make up the guestroom.
- Okay.
- [DEVON CHUCKLES]
- I could stay at the W.
- You wanted to see me, boss?
- One second, buddy.
- Everything okay?
- Just, uh... a bit overwhelmed right now, you know?
- Work stuff, and, uh, I promised Chuck that I would help him with something.
- Can I ask you a question? How do you do it?
- Balance the Buy More and your life... ?
- Son.
- In my 12 and a half weeks at the El g*n School of Finance... I learned one very important word: Delegate.
- That word is the key to being a successful manager.
- There's even a catchy phrase for when you got too much to do.
- Get it off your plate, give it to other people.
- What you mean to say is get it off your plate, delegate.
- No, I do not.
- You are not a rhyming monkey, you are a manager.
- You're right. Of course. You're absolutely right.
- And thank you for the offer.
- I would love for you to dress the Buy More for Halloween.
- Ha, ha, Lord, no, I do not have time for that. I'm knee-deep in this Danielle Steel novel.
- Anyway, Big Mike isn't nearly scary enough to build a haunted house.
- You need to put some real crazies on that.
- [CASCADA'S "EVACUATE THE DANCEFLOOR" PLAYING ON TV]
- Turn up the music Let's get out on the floor Watch me getting physical Out of control If you want it done correctly.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Carmichael. I'll show you to your table.
- That would be perfect, thank you.
- We just got word that Wheelwright is en route.
- Remember, cool, calm and collected. You're Volkoff's top w*apon buyer.
- Just one question.
- Can we get one of those hostess outfits for back home?
- Focus, Bartowski. Grown-ups are trying to work here.
- Morgan: So sorry I'm late.
- You weren't here already?
- Ha, ha. Nice, I love our little give-and-take.
- Classic Ross and Rachel.
- Okay, what can I do to help?
- Grimes.
- Yeah?
- A good spy is trained in the art of silence.
- Silence. Got it.
- Chuck, don't fill up on bread, you'll ruin your appetite.
- Sorry, Chuck...
- No.
- Target is approaching. Give the signal.
- Ahem. Uh, Mr. Carmichael?
- Please, sit. Make yourself comfortable.
- So, um... do we talk price?
- Dr. Wheelwright, relax.
- I'm about to make you a very, very rich man.
- Would you care for a drink to calm the nerves?
- Toasting already?
- What's going on there, Walker?
- That's Chuck's mother.
- Casey: What's she doing there?
- You must be Mr. Carmichael.
- Chuck, remember, keep your cover and make the deal.
- Chuck: I am Mr. Carmichael.
- And who might you be?
- I work for Volkoff. It's my job to ensure a smooth transaction.
- Smooth? Smooth? Is that right?
- Well, this transaction couldn't be going smoother.
- It is chock-full of smoothness.
- Yes, the, uh, transaction was progressing just fine.
- Well, it may appear that way.
- But sometimes appearances don't tell the whole story.
- I've done some digging on Mr. Carmichael here... and unfortunately his story doesn't check out.
- It's a CIA trap. He's a spy.
- What?
- Man down, man down. Walker, get in there.
- [PEOPLE SCREAMING]
- Oh, holy...
- Chuck, you okay? Chuck?
- Chuck?
- [GASPS]
- [COUGHING]
- Chuck, you okay?
- Sarah.
- My mom sh*t me.
- My heart hurts.
- I know. I can't believe your mom betrayed you.
- No, my heart actually hurts. She sh*t me in the heart area.
- Oh, okay, here.
- Thank you.
- Ah.
- Oh, I'm such an idiot, Sarah.
- After everything I knew about my mom, everything I learned... I still trusted her anyway. That's really great spy work.
- You know, Chuck, even in the spy world, where everything is run by deceit... you still manage to somehow genuinely trust people.
- You know what? That's what I love about you.
- That's what you love about me, huh? Not my dashing good looks?
- Or the giant computer in my brain?
- And you're funny even if your mom has sh*t you in the heart.
- So two fugitives and a dangerous w*apon on the loose. Go team.
- We could go back to the restaurant, see if they left any clues behind.
- No, no, no, we got this, dude.
- You just got sh*t by your mom, okay? Take a break.
- Have a little Chuck time.
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- Maybe I should.
- [CELL PHONE RINGS]
- Sorry.
- Spy work or the Buy More?
- Nah.
- Huh.
- [GROANS]
- I don't know. What about there?
- And then it could come swinging and screaming at everybody.
- Oh, Morgo, hey.
- Um, listen, we have a few questions regarding these Halloween decorations.
- Um, what are we allowed to show?
- What do you mean?
- I know a really good morgue that gives discounts on unclaimed merchandise.
- Mm-hm.
- We could sprinkle some dead ones in here.
- Right. I'm gonna say no on the dead bodies.
- So, what, I just lose my deposit?
- Shh.
- Okay, look, here's the thing.
- I put you in charge so I can get it off my plate.
- So you're gonna have to figure it out for me.
- Make it big, make it fun, but most importantly, let's make it scary, okay?
- Lester: Hmm.
- Morgan's right.
- We gotta tap into a place that is so scary, so demented... that it'll change Halloween as we know it.
- We gotta tap... into your head.
- Okay.
- Yeah, you gotta start using conditioner. Your hair feels like hay.
- Hey, Steve.
- [CAR ACCELERATES]
- Get in.
- Are you crazy?
- You know, I didn't think you could top abandoning me for the last 20 years.
- And then you sh*t me.
- And I will do it again if you don't get in this car right now.
- [CELL PHONE BEEPS]
- Sarah: That's every bus-station, subway and traffic-light camera... within a mile of the restaurant.
- And we have no lead on where Wheelwright and Chuck's mom fled to.
- Come on. What rock are you two hiding under?
- Chuck just activated his tracking device.
- Mom, you hit one pothole, and this ride gets very messy very quick.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I have to keep up appearances.
- Oh. Oh, is that all? What the heck is going on here? This is crazy.
- Chuck, when I left you and Ellie... I was embedded into a secret operation called Project !sis.
- My mission was to destroy the Volkoff organization from within.
- But I got in way too deep... and I was forced to close the door on my old life.
- But then you came looking for me, and that set off the alarm bells.
- Right. So you sh*t me?
- I knew you were wearing a vest.
- Volkoff was tapped into the security footage at the café.
- So he thinks that Charles Carmichael is dead... and that means you and Ellie are safe.
- You did this to protect me and Ellie?
- Chuck, you and your sister are, and always have been, my only concern.
- Not being in your lives has pained me more than you could ever imagine.
- But you had a mission.
- [SIGHS]
- [TIRES SQUEAL]
- I constantly relive that day when I walked out the door.
- Over and over.
- And I want you to know that if I could do it over again... I never would have left.
- I would still be there, with my family.
- But that's all in the past.
- So come with me.
- Because I never got you a present for your 10th birthday.
- Come on.
- Follow me.
- See, I knew that if I sh*t you, Wheelwright might panic... and try to unload the w*apon on his own.
- But Atroxium is far too dangerous, so I just went ahead and handled it.
- Handle? How did you handle it exactly?
- This is Wheelwright's mobile lab.
- He's tranqed up inside, and the Atroxium's ready for extraction.
- And, Chuck, sorry I sh*t you.
- Hey, it's okay. No harm, no foul.
- [SIRENS WAILING NEARBY]
- Mom...
- I know.
- You activated your tracking device when you got in the car.
- Good boy.
- Okay, come on. Chuck's signal is coming from in there.
- Agents will be here any second.
- You're gonna vanish for good now?
- I did what I came here to do.
- And now you and Ellie are safe, and I've got to go back undercover.
- Okay, okay, fine. But, listen, before you disappear, please go and talk to Ellie.
- Just for a second. Just tell her what you told me about why you left us.
- Sarah: Two hundred meters.
- [TRACKING DEVICE BEEPING]
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, Chuck.
- Mom, Ellie's pregnant.
- She's pregnant and you're going to be a grandmother.
- We're getting closer, 80 meters.
- Oh.
- [BANGING]
- Chuck, how'd you get here?
- My mom dropped me off.
- Well, she may be a bad mom, but she makes a great spy, right?
- Either way, I guess it doesn't matter. She's gone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- I'm just wondering what to tell my sister.
- Do I casually drop that Mom came back to town to sh**t me in the chest... and hand over a deadly chemical w*apon?
- Well, I know that you'll figure out the exact right thing to say.
- WOMAN [ON MONITOR]: Excuse me.
- Lucky for me, I know the foremost authority on all things Ellie Bartowski.
- I'll be right back.
- You save some of that fun for me.
- I will.
- I don't trust her. If Bartowski's mom works for the good guys, why disappear?
- I don't know, but Chuck believes her.
- Yeah.
- I know a decommissioned NSA agent who specializes in expunged documents.
- Unsavory character, but I think he can get us what we need.
- You want backup?
- No. I got someone.
- I knew it. I knew Mrs. B wasn't a bad guy.
- Bad guys don't make such delicious lemon bars.
- k*ll brownies too. Look, I need your advice for this, Morg...
- Hey. Ah.
- Ow. Ow.
- What... ? What the... ?
- Wow. They did it. Jeff and Lester pulled it off. This looks great.
- Guys, hey, excellent work with the Halloween decorations.
- The store looks incredible.
- This garbage?
- No, no, no, this is just to whet your appetite for the main event.
- Gentlemen, prepare yourselves for the Aisle of Terror.
- [RECORDED EVIL LAUGHTER]
- Prepare to be terrorized.
- [BAT SCREECHES]
- Fernando, not now.
- I mean...
- [HOWLING]
- We got the idea from an experiment... that the UCLA Psychology Department did on our friend Jeffrey.
- Nothing I won't do for $30 and a sandwich.
- Lester: Um...
- Or just a sandwich.
- You see, there's this world-renowned professor, Professor Schofield... who specializes in examining the subconscious of the mentally disturbed.
- He gets right up in there.
- Shh.
- So using Jeffrey and a bunch of other nutbags as test cases... he discovered that there are certain images... that can cause terror in even the most fearless lunatics.
- Let's do this.
- Jeff: So now... get ready to see some of the scariest things in the world.
- Old people.
- Public showers.
- What's going on, Chuck?
- Interspecies relationships.
- Okay. Well, stop now. Stop.
- Uh, huh, I'll be honest with you, this might be one of the worst things I've ever seen.
- One of the best things?
- I think he said "best. "
- I don't want any customers in here. Guys, it's scary... but just in a really bad way.
- I give up. I give up.
- [BABY GIGGLES]
- Babies in costume.
- Really?
- Is it a baby or is it a snail?
- I don't know.
- Good.
- So, Honey, you have any parenting tips?
- I mean, Devon turned out so good.
- I figured you could give me some inside scoop.
- Well, you know, Devon was amazing right from the start.
- Really great genes, I guess.
- I guess. Ha, ha.
- But don't you worry, this little wonder is already halfway there.
- [BOTH CHUCKLE]
- You know, we really have to make sure that this baby... has positive female influences.
- So I'm here to help.
- Thanks, Honey.
- Is this not the most adorable thing you've ever seen?
- It's adorable.
- It plays the "Chicken Dance. "
- ["CHICKEN DANCE" PLAYING]
- Devon, like this stuffed bear is gonna teach this baby... how to read and write?
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- Here. Babies love dictionaries.
- I'm gonna see if they have an encyclopedia.
- [SIGHS]
- Devon: You okay, hon?
- Ellie: I'm fine.
- Ha, ha. Your, uh... Your mother might be, uh, a bit much... but underneath it all, she just wants to be a part of the baby's life.
- It's more than I can say for my mom.
- Chuck: I've been thinking about my mom.
- It's weird. The woman I found is nothing like the one from my childhood.
- You're trying to justify not telling Ellie?
- Am I that transparent?
- No.
- But you don't wanna hurt her.
- Okay, let's get started on the detonator.
- [EMITTING HIGH-PITCH TONE]
- That's not good.
- Wheelwright. Quick, quick.
- Why is the device counting down?
- Oh, that?
- Well, just a safety measure to protect against tampering.
- It counts down until I verify that the w*apon is in my possession.
- Okay, tell us how to turn it off.
- Well, you'll need this.
- But why should I help you?
- Remember, if the device goes off, you'll be exposed.
- So be a good boy and turn it off.
- Well played.
- Get out. Come on.
- [SIGHS]
- There, I deactivated the safety check. It shouldn't bother you again.
- Okay, good. I'll get the handcuffs.
- Keep him close while we continue to work on this.
- Yeah, hurry up. Here, you sit.
- [HIGH-PITCH TONE]
- Aah! What have you done?
- Oops.
- Sarah, get back.
- [ALARM BUZZING]
- Chuck, no! Chuck!
- [GASPS]
- Your hands are shaking.
- Unh.
- That's how it begins.
- Okay, you exposed both of us?
- Why? Why would you do that?
- [DISTORTED] Well, I developed this nerve gas by testing it on myself.
- It was a long, terrifying process.
- But after a while, I gave in, surrendered to my insanity.
- And now I'm not scared of anything, so...
- What scares you, Chuck? Hmm?
- [LAUGHS]
- [YELLS]
- Everything, everything, everything.
- Almost everything.
- [GROWLS]
- Make it stop. Make it stop. Somebody turn it off.
- Listen, it's all in your head. You need to fight it.
- I'm trying, but it's horrible.
- This is exactly why I don't see scary movies... and I stick mainly to the PG-13 region.
- Wheelwright: Let's go.
- [GRUNTING AND PANTING]
- Come on.
- If you get me out of here, I will consider taking you to the antitoxin.
- Anything. Anything you want.
- Now I'm gonna k*ll that bitch Frost for double-crossing me.
- No, no, I can't let that happen.
- [ALARM BUZZING]
- Did you just lock us in here?
- Oops.
- Oh.
- Look who's the comedian now.
- Unh!
- Ha-ha-ha.
- [PANTING]
- [SQUAWKS]
- [LAUGHS MANIACALLY]
- Chuck.
- Sarah?
- [g*n]
- Wheelwright: It's getting worse. These are your deepest fears.
- No, please make it stop.
- Wheelwright: There's no escape.
- We're both locked in here.
- Chuck: No, no.
- Come on, Casey, pick up.
- Okay, our informant should be here soon to give us that data on Project !sis.
- This is so cool. "Our informant. " That is so cloak-and-dagger. I love it.
- What does that make me? The inside man, the mole?
- You're the magnet.
- The magnet. I love that, yeah.
- Spies have such... The coolest names.
- Okay, what do you need the magnet to do?
- You already look like a spy.
- Now all I need you to do is stand here by the Vic and act like one.
- Yeah?
- Done.
- How was that?
- Wonderful.
- [PANTING]
- Boo! Found you.
- Aah!
- Oh, look. Aisle of Terror.
- An unfortunate place for you to be trapped.
- [CHUCK YELLS]
- [DISTORTED] Now do you feel like getting us out of here?
- Aisle of Terror.
- Images that can cause terror in even the most fearless lunatics.
- What... ? What the hell is this?
- Public showers?
- That's peculiar.
- It reminds me of Professor Schofield's work.
- That hack, thought he knew about fear.
- [BABY GIGGLING]
- A baby in a snail costume.
- It is Schofield's work.
- It's crazy, I...
- Is it a baby or a snail?
- No, no. Oh.
- Old people.
- Oh.
- Get it out of my head.
- Interspecies relations.
- The terror, the terror. It's all flooding back now.
- Black licorice.
- Oh, please.
- Please make it stop.
- Chuck: Man feet.
- Aah!
- Otters.
- This can't be happening.
- Schofield!
- [GRUNTS]
- Chuck. Chuck, are you okay? What happened?
- Sarah, I don't wanna see you like this... so I'm just gonna keep my eyes closed till we get the antidote, okay?
- Okay, okay, bye.
- Let's get up, come on.
- Oh, God.
- [WHISTLING]
- Give me your g*n.
- [g*n COCKS]
- Uh, no, uh, but it's not a real g*n.
- It's just a heavily modified paintball p*stol.
- I know paintball's still dangerous, but what I'm trying to explain... is it's not real.
- I'll take that folder.
- Morgan: Casey.
- Casey, what is going on? Why is there a g*n to my head?
- I'm the magnet.
- I'm the magnet for bad guys?
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on, man. I can't believe you.
- I cannot believe you would use me as a human target.
- What nerve.
- Grimes.
- No, I need to finish, and this may sting, but you need to hear it.
- You, sir, are not very thoughtful, not one bit.
- I mean, am I alone here?
- Well...
- Yeah.
- Are you agreeing with him?
- Whose side are you on?
- Can I go?
- Yeah, run along.
- Ugh. Not cool, man. That is just not cool.
- You did good, Grimes.
- Really? Thank you.
- I tried to really kind of sink into the role, you know...
- Hmm.
- Oh, I know that "hmm. "
- Why? What does it say?
- Chuck's mom's story checks out. She's totally clean.
- Perfect.
- Oh, ahem, that was not a fun trip.
- Thank God we got Wheelwright to give up that antitoxin... before he went completely off the reservation.
- Thank you, Sarah. You're the greatest partner ever.
- [CELL PHONE VIBRATES]
- Mm.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
- My mom, she left a message.
- She wants to see Ellie tonight before she goes back undercover.
- I honestly thought Ellie would never see my mom again.
- Uh, I'll come with you.
- No, no, no. Hey, I appreciate your concern, Sarah, but trust me.
- It's my mom.
- Hey, sis.
- Brushing up on your vocab, huh?
- Uh, just trying to get away from Honey for a few minutes.
- It's ironic, isn't it?
- The mother that I wish would disappear is here to answer all of my questions.
- And the mother that I wish I could talk to has disappeared forever.
- Hey, Ellie, you, uh... You got plans tonight?
- What's with all the secrecy?
- Needed to get away from Castle in case Grimes was hanging around.
- If he knew the truth, he'd go running to his BFF.
- Everything about Bartowski's mother's life is a fake.
- Project !sis? It ended 20 years ago when Frost went rogue.
- So, what, she's a double agent? She's working directly for Volkoff?
- We should've grabbed her before she dropped off the map again.
- What? What is it, Walker?
- So, what do we do when she walks through the door?
- I... Part of me wants to be reserved, show her I'm an adult... that I've been just fine since she left.
- The other part of me just wants to hug her.
- Do whatever feels right.
- I'll take a look. She might've got lost.
- Okay.
- Chuck.
- [RADIO CHATTER NEARBY]
- Mom. No!
- Chuck!
- Chuck: Stop!
- No, no! Let her go!
- Stop! You have no idea what's going on. Your mom isn't the spy you think she is.
- Sarah?
- I'm protecting your blind spot.
- Sarah!
- Chuck, what is it?
- Ellie, I'm sorry, but Mom is not coming.
- Why does she keep doing this to us?
- Because she's a spy.
