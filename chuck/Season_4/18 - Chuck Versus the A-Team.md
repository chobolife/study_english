# Chuck Versus the A-Team

- Hi. I'm Chuck. Here are a few things you might need to know.
- Lester: Is it strange that all of the new employees have been named Greta?
- Devon, this is one of my father's laptops.
- How did... ? He left it for Ellie. There's something on it, some memory problem that Ellie figured out.
- Morgan: What was exactly going down there in Castle?
- Casey: Are you leveraging me to stay in my apartment?
- Let's say I was.
- You can stay at my place, long as you keep quiet.
- Don't tell anyone, especially Bartowski.
- (gasps)
- Cloaked Voice: Hope you didn't think this interrogation was over, Mr. Grimes.
- We know about your involvement with the CIA.
- I have no idea, no idea what you're talking about.
- We know that you work with John Casey.
- Just admit it; this can all be over.
- I don't know anything, I don't know.
- Okay, okay, hold on a second.
- I admit it.
- I have worked with John Casey.
- We worked together for the last four years now.
- We started in large appliances, and then I worked up to Buy More manager.
- You think this is funny?
- Are you really willing to sacrifice your life to protect John Casey?
- My only regret is that I have one life to give.
- Go ahead, do your worst.
- (panting)
- Okay.
- (chuckles) That was tough.
- Well, you didn't wet yourself this time.
- That's an improvement.
- I didn't drink any water today.
- Welcome to the team, soldier.
- Thank you, sir.
- Glad to be part of it.
- (sighs)
- Whoa.
- (cloaked): So where are you going-- a super secret spy mission?
- Don't do that.
- I'm just goofing around with you there, buddy, roomie.
- First rule of Team Casey, right: don't ask, don't tell.
- What about Chuck and Sarah?
- Especially not Chuck and Sarah.
- Sorry.
- You really care about your best friend, you'll lock it down, Morgan.
- (door opens)
- (door closes)
- Morgan Grimes, you are a badass.
- (chuckles)
- Oh, no, I peed a little bit.
- (beeping) SARAH: 15 seconds.
- Ten...
- Sarah, stop yelling.
- You know I don't work well under pressure.
- Okay?
- (buzzing) Gah, no, no, no.
- Damn wishbone.
- Your turn.
- I can't do this anymore.
- I'm sorry, we've been sitting around for two weeks.
- We need a mission, Chuck.
- So we hit a dry spell?
- Are you ready for some real excitement?
- Final Fantasy II.
- Morgan and I spent an entire summer devouring this one.
- What is the point of being a spy if there aren't any missions?
- Ca...
- Casey, what are you doing here?
- Did Beckman call?
- No, I'm just... returning something.
- A. 50-cal sn*per r*fle?
- Why are you checking w*apon out of the armory?
- I was just plinking on the range.
- Don't want a beautiful w*apon like this to feel neglected.
- Well, what about us? Do you think Beckman has secretly sidelined our team?
- Yeah, why else would our missions dry up like this?
- I don't know, maybe the Intersect has made the world a more peaceful place.
- Hmm.
- What is that about?
- Well, you think we're stir-crazy.
- Think about how Casey feels.
- I mean, he hasn't sh*t someone in two weeks.
- That we know of.
- Casey is up to something and I am going to get to the bottom of it.
- Sarah... Sarah.
- (beeping)
- (door beeps, closes)
- This is so weird.
- I didn't know this hallway even existed.
- Maybe it's part of all that new construction that's been going on.
- (beeping)
- (scoffs) Huh.
- Well, allow me. It's not like they're going to deny the one and only Intersect. (chuckles)
- (beeping)
- Okay, so maybe you're not being completely paranoid.
- Come to think of it, I haven't seen much of Casey in the last couple weeks.
- Do you think he's gone lone wolf on us?
- Yeah, that's it, prowling around the streets at night, administering vigilante justice.
- I mean, come...
- Actually, that's, that's entirely plausible.
- Chuck, I think it's time for a spy intervention.
- We need to put our partner on the spot.
- No.
- I have a better idea.
- Hey, Chuck, what's up, man?
- Hey, buddy, um, you mind if I come in?
- You know what? I do mind because, uh, I just waxed my floors.
- Really? Cooked that one up on the spot, did you?
- What's your new spy partner been up to these days?
- Oh, you must be referring to my domestic partner,  for I am not privy to Casey's spy life.
- Well, have you seen your new roommate disappearing at odd times?
- No.
- Coming home with fresh injuries?
- None that I'm aware of.
- Receiving solo missions from one General Diane Beckman?
- Can't say that I have, Chief.
- (grunts)
- One more little question.
- Mm-hmm.
- Where have all my missions gone?
- Because either all the bad guys are on vacation or Casey's up to something.
- Or maybe the Intersect has just made the world a more peaceful place.
- (chuckles)
- (high-pitched chuckle)
- Yeah.
- (chuckles)
- Yeah.
- Good seeing you, pal.
- I can't believe Morgan would just lie to my face like that.
- I can't believe Casey would lie to my face... my old partner.
- Wait, didn't Casey say that Beckman had him working on something new?
- Do you think Beckman is sending him out on missions without us?
- That's crazy talk, Sarah, why would Beckman do that?
- We're Casey's team.
- SARAH (whispering): Wait, he's on the move.
- Oh, oh, are we really doing this right now... I mean, spying on our own partner?
- Isn't that a little icky?
- Well, think about it.
- If Casey is going out on missions without us, then he is doing so without the Intersect.
- You're right.
- What if he gets in a jam?
- What if he needs our help?
- I mean, we're not spying on Casey.
- We're watching his back.
- Duh.
- ♪ ♪
- Chuck: It sure was nice of Devon to let us borrow his new Sienna.
- I mean, it is the perfect tail vehicle.
- Think about it... dual screens, Bluetooth, ten-speaker sound system, and it's so comfy.
- Yeah, it's unassuming.
- That's why it's the perfect tail vehicle.
- Chuck: Of course, yes, you're right, focus.
- Time to find out what kind of game Casey's playing.
- (g*n hammers cocking) Easy.
- Your boss is expecting me.
- I wasn't expecting you, I was expecting Dragan, and I wasn't expecting him for two days.
- Slight change of plans.
- Wasn't part of our arrangement.
- All right.
- My employer will be happy to do business elsewhere.
- Please... excuse my lack of hospitality.
- Chuck: He's all alone.
- What's he trying to do... get himself k*ll?
- Don't you want to open it?
- I would trust Dragan with my life.
- You, on the other hand, John Casey, NSA agent, not so much.
- What exactly was your plan... to just walk in here and arrest me, all alone? (chuckles)
- (g*n cock) SARAH: He's not alone.
- He wouldn't go undercover without his team.
- Chuck: Yeah, honestly, what do you take him for?
- What are you doing here?
- Saving your life, partner.
- I don't need saving, idiot.
- Oh, really, I'm the idiot, huh?
- Please, let me settle this.
- You are all idiots.
- (loud thud)
- You're under arrest.
- Good work, Colonel.
- Wait, so this was all a sting?
- Chuck: Hang on a second.
- Is that Greta... and the other Greta?
- Chuck, Sarah.
- Meet my new team.

- (whimpers)
- Look at those two.
- First, they take over the Buy More, then they steal our partner, and now they're taking over our spy base.
- I just can't believe Casey replaced us.
- I can't believe the CIA replaced us.
- Come again?
- Well, who do you think is taking all of our missions?
- Honey, please, look, I have something irreplaceable in this little head of mine, okay?
- So let Casey have his new team.
- You've still got the Intersect, baby.
- Let's go introduce ourselves, shall we?
- Rick: So I said to him, "You can keep your larger magazine capacity.
- "When it comes to stopping power, nothing b*at my. 45. "
- That is hilarious.
- That hilarious.
- . 45s.
- Great work back there, by the way, with the, with the g*n and the bad guys and the... b-b-boo!
- Took 'em all out.
- That was impressive. I'm sorry, but I never got your actual names, and I really don't want to keep calling you Greta.
- I'm assuming GRETA's probably an acronym for...
- Captain Richard Noble.
- Captain Victoria Dunwoody.
- Both: Captain.
- Chuck: Captain.
- Both: Agent.
- Rick and Vicki.
- It's rhymey. It's cute.
- You guys a couple or something?
- Don't be ridiculous. It's against agency protocol.
- Romantic entanglements lead to lapses in judgment.
- You ought to know.
- Casey: Agent Walker?
- (clears throat)
- A word, please.
- So, what kind of music are you guys into?
- I see you're very busy.
- I see you picked your new team for their sparkling personalities.
- I'm sorry you had to find out this way.
- Oh, forget it. It's not like I've been your partner for the last four years.
- Please let me explain.
- No, it's cool. You know, I get it.
- You've been busy, Beckman gave you a new team, you've been out running missions with them.
- This wasn't Beckman's idea.
- (whirring)
- Colonel Casey, grab your team.
- Mission briefing in five.
- That is, if you're all through fraternizing with your old team.
- So, who is, uh, Susie Sunshine?
- Director Bentley.
- She's our Beckman... except not as warm and cuddly.
- Well, babe, I guess it's just you and me.
- Where are you going?
- To fix this.
- Oh, boy.
- General, why didn't you tell us that Casey was heading up his own team?
- Agent Walker, you're not the only one who has to take orders.
- I'm playing the cards I was dealt.
- I suggest you do the same.
- Quick follow-up question, General?
- Who's the A-team, and who's the B-team here?
- I know that you love our team and Casey's team equally...
- Enough. Both of you.
- Right now you need to focus on the mission at hand.
- Which is?
- A top-priority extraction from Tblisi.
- You'll recognize the target of the Colonel's recent sting operation, Necati Acar, AKA The Turk.
- Although his arrest was important, the real prize is this man... Dragan Pichushkin.
- Arms dealer.
- He's made a fortune dismantling the former Soviet arsenal, and selling it on the black market.
- The Turk has agreed to lure Dragan onto U. S. soil under one condition.
- That we offer his family asylum?
- Precisely, Agent Walker.
- All we have is a first name... Jana.
- Wife?
- Jana?
- Jana. Mistress.
- Think it's probably a mistress. No photos?
- That's why we're sending you.
- Wheels up first thing in the morning.
- Use the Intersect to ID Jana, and return her safely to U. S. soil.
- That is all... team.
- I think she meant to say "A-team. "
- I can't believe we're finally going on a mission!
- (snapping his fingers)
- Hey.
- Devon, you okay?
- Just trying to find my baseline, bro.
- Oh, stressful day at the ER?
- Trauma surgery's a cinch.
- It's coming home that's stressful.
- Being home with the baby has made Ellie a little stir crazy.
- Must be going around. When I walk through that door, she makes up for 12 hours of not talking to another adult in about 12 minutes.
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
- Ellie: Hi, honey. How was work?
- I'm so glad you're home. I've been dying to talk.
- Remember how I've been trying to keep track of Clara's sleep schedule?
- Well, I finally crunched some numbers.
- At first I couldn't find the Circadian cycle, but then, I applied some basic biostatistics.
- Voila. Isn't that incredible? Oh, wait till you see the data that I gathered during tummy time.
- And here is a chart of Clara's new vocal sounds.
- Trust me, you can go a little loony with somebody babbling in your ear all day long.
- (both laugh)
- The problem is, I only have one test subject, so in order to control my experiment, we're going to have to have a second baby.
- (spitting)
- Joking.
- Speaking of computer modeling, whatever happened to my dad's laptop?
- Devon?
- Devon, are you listening to me?
- Huh? Yeah. Computers.
- Brain science. Totally with you.
- Good, because I'm starting to think that my dad left me that computer for a reason.
- Maybe his research is just the diversion that I need right now.
- Devon, I want that computer back.
- Sarah: I wonder what Casey's team is up to.
- Chuck: Who cares? Beckman said it herself... this extraction is top priority.
- (phone ringing)
- It's the bro-in-law.
- Hey, Devon. What's going on, buddy?
- Chuck, we need to talk.
- Why are you whispering?
- 'Cause Clara's sleeping.
- And I don't want Ellie to hear.
- Can this wait till I'm home?
- Captain: Chuck, Ellie wants your dad's laptop.
- She thinks he gave it to her for a reason.
- No. Devon, listen to me, and listen to me very carefully.
- She cannot have the laptop.
- The laptop is filled with all kinds of dangerous spy stuff, which is probably why it's buried deep beneath Langley right now.
- That's great, but she gave the computer to me.
- What am I supposed to tell her?
- I don't know. Tell her you lost it. Better yet...
- Better yet, tell her you brought it to the Buy More to get it fixed.
- She'll assume Jeff and Lester lost it.
- Good cover story, bro.
- Hey, that's why you called a pro, huh?
- Wait.
- I'm seeing a... square?
- Close. Squiggly lines.
- Excuse me?
- Damn it, lady!
- Can't you see that you're ruining his concentration?
- Listen, I'm just here to get my computer, and then you two can go back to your little game.
- Game? I will have you know, Eleanor, that our friend Jeffrey here is a clairvoyant.
- Read her thoughts, Jeffrey.
- She hates us.
- She thinks we're pathetic.
- She doesn't believe in ESP.
- That's really good.
- Can I have my computer?
- Fine. Where's your claim stub?
- I don't know. Devon dropped it off.
- No claim stub, no computer. Mush!
- Okay, uh, you guys just...
- You don't understand. There's-There's something really important on that laptop.
- Something... private.
- Go on.
- Devon and I... we made a video when we were in med school.
- Um, I'd just hate for it to fall into the wrong hands.
- Jeffrey, clear our schedule.
- Ma'am, we're gonna find that laptop if it's the last thing we do.
- (laughs)
- Ugh.
- Looks like Jana's running a little late.
- Or else The Turk's enemies got to her before we did.
- (tires squealing)
- Looks like this landing zone is about to get a little hot.
- That's why Beckman sent us.
- Do any of those guys look like a Jana to you?
- You wanted Jana? I'm getting her.
- These charmers stuffed her in the trunk.
- I don't like this, Sarah.
- Oh, my God, they chopped her up into little pieces.
- (barking)
- What?
- Sarah, meet Jana.
- (growling)
- This was our big extraction?
- A stupid dog? !
- Sometimes boss's dog gets upset tummy.
- Try mixing in a cup of her dry food with the wet stuff.
- (whining) And be sure to walk her every hour, or... that happens.
- Oh!
- Oh, gross.
- Oh, my God, Sarah.
- We're the B-team.
- (Jana whines)
- We used to be the A-team, Sarah, the sharp end of the CIA stick.
- And now we're glorified pet couriers?
- Nothing has changed, Chuck. Oh, is that right?
- Well, okay, what do you call Casey's new team then?
- I call them the competition.
- You want to be on the A-team again, we're gonna have to earn it.
- What? How?
- Dragan. Beckman said he's the brass ring.
- We're gonna collar him, and we're gonna show the General that we've still got it.
- Except that the only person who can lead us to Dragan is The Turk, and who knows where they're keeping him.
- (barking)
- Is that... ?
- Jana?
- (barking)
- I bet she's got an upset tummy.
- Do you think they remembered to mix in the dry food?
- Chuck, if The Turk's dog is behind that door, so is The Turk.
- All we got to do is get through four inches of solid steel.
- Or we chop off Casey's hand.
- Let's keep that as our backup plan, shall we?
- Sure.
- Okay.
- (knocking)
- Morgan, I can hear you eating potato chips.
- All right? Open the door.
- Can't do that, Chuck. This is ridiculous.
- Why can't we talk face-to-face?
- Just trust me, okay? It's for your own good.
- Oh, is that right?
- Or is that what Casey told you to tell me?
- Hey, hey, the Colonel's a good man, and he gave me my orders, okay?
- To lock it down.
- Let me in!
- Over my dead body, Chuck.
- How about over your tranq'd body?
- You were distracting me so she could break in.
- Chuck: Yeah.
- Clever girl.
- Are you using the five-milligram darts?
- Ten.
- Please tell Casey I put up a good fight.
- (sh**ting)
- Great. Now all we need is something with Casey's handprint on it so we can access the secret part of Castle.
- Ooh. What are these?
- These have a camera inside of them that'll scan for any bioresidue.
- Ugh! Sounds like a CBS show.
- I found one, but this handprint is way too tiny.
- Looks like it belongs to a child.
- Oh, right.
- Bingo.
- Sarah.
- (whirring, trilling)
- (whooshing)
- Not bad for the B-team.
- Holy crap! Their Castle is so much cooler than ours.
- I wonder if they have that fancy Greek yogurt in their kitchen.
- (barking)
- Okay, you go find The Turk.
- I'm gonna see if I can pull up Dragan's case file.
- (barking continues)
- (barking)
- Please, I told you everything I know about Dragan's shipments. No, no, no, no, relax. I'm not part of their team.
- They are like a pair of evil robots.
- Wait. They told me about you.
- You're the dog-walker, no?
- I'm happy you're here.
- Jana was beginning to walk funny.
- She needs to have, uh, how you say, a pee-pee time.
- Chuck.
- Chuck, I think you should look at this.
- Hey.
- What's up? What do you want me... ?
- My dad's computer.
- Why would they... ?
- Oh, my God, Casey, please tell me you didn't.
- (alarm blaring) I think it's time for us to go, right now.
- You're not authorized to be in this section of Castle.
- What are you two doing with my father's computer?
- Sorry, Bartowski, the Intersect project is classified.
- Classifi... Classified? !
- I'm not authorized to be down here?
- I am the Intersect.
- You're not as special as you think.
- I think you should get out of here, before you get hurt.
- I see you know kung fu.
- That's very impressive, but a little showy for my taste.
- How about this style, Bartowski?
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- Chuck, what is happening?
- We're following the same program.
- Sarah, they're Intersects.
- Casey: Stand down, Captain.
- So this was your idea, Casey, huh?
- Use my father's program to make your own Intersects?
- Well, now that you have your dream team, I guess you don't need me around anymore. But that right there... that's mine and I'm taking it.
- You don't want to do that, Bartowski.
- Yeah? Well, my father never wanted his invention to be used like this. Drop it.
- That computer is property of the U. S. government.
- Call off your dogs, Casey.
- Captain, put the g*n down. Now.
- First you put the computer down, Bartowski.
- Or I'll put a b*llet in that obsolete brain of yours.
- Bentley: That's enough.
- I'd do as she says, Mr. Bartowski.
- Unlike you, my Intersects aren't afraid to pull the trigger.
- Now do you understand why I had Beckman send you to Tblisi?
- Yeah, you wanted us out of the way.
- The CIA's two Intersect teams were never supposed to, well, intersect.
- It was important that you not interfere with the GRETA field tests.
- Right. The GRETA's in the Buy More.
- We've been using your store as a proving ground for prospective Intersect candidates.
- These two are the best of the best.
- Oh, really? Uh, so then what does that make me?
- None of this would be possible without you, Chuck.
- Bentley: That's right. We've been studying you, as well.
- Correcting your father's software for your various limitations.
- What limitations?
- His emotional sensitivity.
- His over-reliance on his handlers.
- His inability to terminate targets.
- You clearly fixed that glitch. Vicki here almost sh*t Chuck.
- If you'll excuse us, we have a mission to complete.
- Dragan Pichushkin, our primary target, is currently en route to an airfield outside of Los Angeles.
- Our analysts at Langley believe that he is on this aircraft, which was...
- Rick: ... hijacked by drug runners in 2006.
- The plane is now registered to a Moscow shell corporation.
- Yeah, what they said.
- Very good.
- Colonel, your team will intercept Pichushkin, confiscate all cargo and return him alive. Ma'am.
- Dismissed.
- Oh, and you two are free to return home and await further orders.
- Unbelievable.
- Walker, Walker, let me explain.
- Don't, Casey. Okay, I get why you left.
- Because if you'd stayed with Chuck and I you would have been mothballed, as well.
- I didn't jump ship. Yeah, well, you didn't exactly go down with the ship, did you?
- I left because you and Bartowski don't need me anymore.
- What? Don't pretend like you don't know what I'm talking about.
- We were a team, Casey.
- No, no, you and Bartowski were the team.
- I was just the backup. That is not true.
- Doesn't matter anyway.
- I just want you to know, I think Bentley's giving you the short end of the stick.
- You and Bartowski... you're still good agents.
- Yeah, well, we used to be the best.
- Ellie: I'm calling about the laptop.
- Did you find it?
- Well, there is a chance that we returned the laptop to the wrong person.
- Gee, what a surprise.
- Don't worry. I've got my best man on it.
- I need you to focus your powers, Jeffrey.
- I need a name.
- I need you to tell me who has that missing computer.
- So...
- You... are going to close your eyes and you're going to jot down whatever letters pop into your head.
- Go.
- No, that's not a letter.
- Deeper.
- Jeffrey. Dig! Dig!
- What just happened?
- Did I do it?
- "Cia"?
- What the hell kind of name is Cia?
- Totally worthless, Jeffrey.
- Take a look at this.
- 12 hours ago... target leaving for the States.
- Bentley: I'm confident that your new team can handle a few bodyguards.
- Not them, that.
- He's not moving parts.
- Pichushkin's moving a fully-assembled b*mb.
- We can assume he's going to use it.
- Director, we need backup.
- You have two GRETA's. What else do you need?
- My old team, Chuck and Sarah.
- It's a five-man job.
- You sure you're not just being sentimental?
- Pichushkin's delivering live expl*sives to a metropolitan center.
- Thanks to the Intersect, we're equipped with live ordnance disposal.
- No, the colonel is right.
- This is a perfect job for Chuck Bartowski.
- b*mb disposal?
- I mean, seriously?
- Don't they have robots for stuff like this?
- It's the only way Bentley would let you come on the mission.
- I guess expendability has its perks.
- Casey: Okay, team, target lands in inside ten.
- You two, help me neutralize Dragan's security team, and take him into custody. Alive.
- You're a vital part of this mission, Chuck. Don't forget it.
- And try not to drop the b*mb, Chuck.
- Once we have the b*mb, ***
- Use the Intersect to defuse it.
- I know you're a little scared, Chuck, but the suit will protect you.
- I saw The Hurt Locker, Casey, okay?
- I know what happened to Guy Pearce.
- His suit didn't really do him a lot of good.
- I'm sorry. I'm being overly sensitive, aren't I?
- I bet your new Intersects, wow, they wouldn't complain, would they?
- I had to wear one of these in Bosnia.
- One of my worst missions.
- Here, let me show you a little trick.
- This way, you don't have to use your hands to drink.
- Thanks, buddy.
- Good luck, Chuck.
- It's your favorite... apple juice.
- ♪ ♪
- (r*fles cocking)
- Oh, oh, Sarah, they are outnumbered and g*n.
- Those guards are carrying a*t*matic w*apon.
- Oh! Holy crap! Those two are like Terminators.
- They just took out five guys in the blink of an eye.
- Welcome to America, Mr. Pichushkin.
- Let me take your luggage.
- It's yours.
- (electronic whirring)
- Portable fission device. Five-kiloton yield.
- Approximate fire ball radius... two kilometers.
- That's a suitcase nuke.
- It's a... I'm sorry.
- Did Casey just say... ?
- Dragan: So you have your b*mb.
- (p*stol cocking)
- But I have detonator.
- So I think it's better if we just part ways, Da?
- Casey, let him go.
- Sarah: I've got my eyes on Dragan.
- Sar...
- Help Walker.
- You stay with the b*mb.
- You need to disarm this now.
- This b*mb is a Frankenstein with a hundred different components.
- There's nothing in the Intersect about how to defuse this.
- I can help with this!
- Chuck: Casey? Hold on.
- I'm coming, Casey! I'm coming!
- I'm coming. I'm coming.
- Show me your hands!
- Where's the detonator?
- (beeping)
- I am detonator.
- Very simple.
- My heart stop, b*mb start.
- So you have choice: you can sh**t me, and hundreds of thousands of people will die in nuclear blast.
- Or I k*ll you.
- Not easy choice.
- Vicki, no, don't sh**t!
- (rapid beeping)
- What did you do? !
- (steady tone)
- (device whirring)
- What the hell just happened?
- Your trigger-happy new partner just armed the b*mb.
- (panting)
- Ooh! Portable fission device, five-kiloton yield.
- Yeah, we covered that. Sir, our best chance is to fly as far away from civilization as possible.
- What? ! We're in the middle of LA County!
- It's a difference between 100, 000 casualties and a million. We gotta move this b*mb now.
- No, no. Casey, no, that's not an option.
- We have to disarm it.
- You've got the same computer I've got.
- It can't be disarmed.
- I can do this, Casey.
- b*mb's all yours, Bartowski.
- You can't be ser... Move.
- Okay.
- Just like old times, huh?
- Just tell me there's a plan. There's a plan, right?
- Yeah, yeah, there's a plan.
- Okay, Casey, first of all, I need you to pull out the primary device.
- Slowly, carefully.
- We're gonna have to improvise our way through this one.
- Improvi... ? ! It's a nuclear b*mb.
- Stow it, Captain.
- Okay, now, Sarah, that hockey puck-looking thing on the end there? That's the detonator.
- I need you to twist and pull... gently.
- (gasps)
- Okay, the detonator is from a next-gen Chinese sub, which means the firing mechanism had to have been modified to allow the warhead's deployment in saltwater.
- Saltwater!
- Saltwater! Yes! These detonators, they automatically deactivate in saltwater in the event of a hull breach.
- We're nowhere near the ocean.
- Ooh...
- Saltwater, saltwater, saltwater...
- Mmm, what has... ?
- What is he doing?
- Casey... my juice box.
- Please have sodium, please have sodium, please have sodium.
- Yeah, it does! Yes, yes, yes.
- Chuck, are you about to disarm a nuclear b*mb using fruit juice?
- Okay, do it.
- (crackles)
- (whirring)
- Both: I can't believe that worked.
- (all sigh)
- (Chuck grunts)
- Love you.
- I love you, too.
- (both chuckle)
- Try not to drop the b*mb, Rick.
- Whoa!
- Looks like things have gotten a little crowded in castle.
- As I told you before, this operation requires only one team.
- I concur. I've read Colonel Casey's report.
- In addition to threatening Agent Bartowski's life, your team managed to k*ll the man you were supposed to capture and accidentally arm a nuclear b*mb.
- General, I take full responsibility for my team.
- The truth is, Director Bentley, you should never have pursued the Intersect field trial without consulting the original Intersect.
- Agent Bartowski, that is why you will oversee all aspects of the Intersect project from here on out.
- And what about my GRETAs?
- (loud whooshing and whirring)
- Computer: Intersect extraction complete.
- (sighs)
- So, how's it feel?
- What a relief to have that outta my head.
- That poor bastard Bartowski.
- Looks like that's it for the team.
- Honor serving with you, sir.
- Captain, Captain, good luck.
- (sighs)
- Bentley: Where do you think you're going?
- I figured I was through here, since I don't have a team.
- I never dismissed you, Colonel.
- Beckman's wrong.
- The problem's not with my GRETAs... it's this computer.
- And you're going to help me fix it.
- Our best engineers couldn't crack Intersect code.
- That's because it wasn't meant for them.
- I need someone who thinks like a Bartowski.
- What are you getting at?
- (blows air)
- Prepare yourself for Final Fantasy deux.
- (phone beeps)
- Oh, please let that be Beckman.
- Oh, come on.
- A new mission already?
- Beckman wants us to leave ASAP.
- She's gonna brief us in the air.
- What? Aren't you curious as to where we're going?
- Well, I'm sure it's someplace far-off, exciting and dangerous.
- And what makes you so sure?
- Chuck, we're the A-team.
- Valid point.
- Well, might as well bring this.
- It's gonna be a long flight.
- I'm sure we can find something else to pass the time.
- ♪ ♪
- Oh. Mmm.
- Not to be crude, but you were talking about sex, right?
- Okay, Devon, "go" time.
- Babe, you okay?
- It's nothing. I went to the Buy More to get my dad's laptop, and of course, they couldn't find it.
- It's my fault.
- I should have never trusted those jackasses.
- No, it's my fault.
- I shouldn't have pretended to be something that I'm not.
- I guess I just thought that there might be something on my dad's computer that would...
- I don't know, change the fact that I'm just a stay-at-home mom.
- Whoa, whoa, stop right there.
- You're Eleanor Bartowski Woodcomb, PhD, M. D. , the brainiest, sexiest, kick-assiest woman I have ever known.
- You're not "just" anything.
- Really?
- You're Mrs. Awesome.
- (murmurs)
- (Morgan groans)
- What happened to you?
- I've been in a drug-induced stupor for the last 24 hours.
- What'd I tell you about letting Jeff buy you drinks at Chili's?
- No, sir, listen, Chuck and Sarah tranq'd me.
- They breached our apartment.
- I blew it, and I'm so sorry, sir.
- So, I'm turning in my wings.
- One, you're not an aviator, two, these wings are plastic.
- Yeah, I told the Southwest pilot they were for my nephew.
- Look, that's not the point.
- The fact remains, I let you down, sir.
- And I'm sorry, I can't lie to Chuck anymore.
- You don't have to.
- From here on out, we're on the same team.
- Oh, yes! What a relief!
- (groans) Gotcha. Okay...
- All right, that's enough.
- Can I have my wings back?
- Mrs. Woodcomb?
- Yes?
- Hi. I believe that I have something of yours.
- This is my dad's computer. Where did you find this?
- The Nerd Herd gave me the wrong computer.
- I found your address in the bag.
- Thank you. You have no idea how much this means to me.
- Hi. You're home early.
- Babe, it's dinnertime.
- What?
- Oh, wow, Clara's taking a monster nap.
- I must have lost myself.
- Is that... ?
- Yeah. Great news.
- I found my dad's computer.
