# Chuck Versus the Leftovers

- Chuck: Hi. Here are a few things you might need to know.
- Ellie: My dad must have left this for me.
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't think you could top abandoning me for 20 years.
- Then you sh\*t me.
- Sarah, my mom did something to me with that device.
- [CHUCK GASPS]
- My name is Alexei Volkoff.
- I believe you were looking for me.
- Sarah, I can't flash. The Intersect is gone.
- [MOZART'S "DIES IRAE" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
- You wanted to see me, Alexei?
- I've just had some disturbing news.
- Agent Carmichael is still alive.
- I'm as surprised as you are.
- I was there.
- We tied them up.
- Planted expl\*sives all around them.
- And yet he survived.
- [VOLKOFF LAUGHS]
- It was my fault.
- I underestimated him.
- Let's tidy things up.
- These are my top assassins in North America.
- Pierre, Victor, Hercule.
- Use them.
- And, Frost?
- Make certain he's really dead this time.
- Morgan: Are you ready for this? You and me, training for hand-to-hand combat.
- Absolutely. Remember, I had six months of training in Prague.
- Now this is Chuck unplugged.
- Sounds hardcore when you say it like that.
- It's gonna be good. I'm mostly just scared about today.
- Black Friday? The scariest shopping day of the year.
- Many a manager has fallen on this day.
- You're gonna be just fine.
- We'll learn moves, you'll get through it.
- I'm pumped.
- Let's go in there and kick some serious ass.
- Get up on the floor And show 'em all why They gonna need sticky paper...
- Instructor: All right, ladies... let's grab a pole and make that booty clap.
- Strip Kick.
- Mixes the self-defense of Krav Maga with the core workout of pole dancing.
- I saw an infomercial on it.
- [LADY GAGA'S "BAD ROMANCE" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
- All right, ladies, kick!
- How's it going with you and Sarah? Any progress on el proposalito?
- Well, I am working on something new. Duck!
- Whoo! But I'm keeping it close to the vest.
- What? Are you serious?
- Chuck, I'm a part-time spy, man, okay?
- I am a very, very serious keeper of secrets.
- Jump!
- Casey can never know about this.
- Never.
- Sarah: So how's the combat training going?
- Ha, ha. Cinnamon's a tough instructor, but I'm picking things up quickly.
- Well, I am just happy to have you back.
- Me too. And you know what? It's the best I've felt in a long time.
- Good. I thought you might be upset... after Ellie and Awesome canceled dinner.
- What? No, no, no. Of course not. They're doctors, it happens.
- Besides, tonight is our annual leftover dinner.
- Just as delicious as Thanksgiving without all the big-event stress.
- Let it snow Let it snow Remember, Frost wants them k\*ll at close range.
- No sound.
- I guess I was just a little worried because the holidays are for family time.
- With everything that happened with your mother...
- Chuck: Well, I've developed a little perspective.
- I'm ready to put the past behind me.
- Really?
- Ha, ha. Don't sound so skeptical, all right?
- If my mom were standing in front of me, I honestly think I'd say: "All is forgiven and good luck being an evil bad guy. "
- And, uh, speaking of looking forward to the future...
- [kn\*fe CLICKS]
- Chuck, get down.
- [GRUNTING]
- Wow, that stuff really works.
- Sarah, I can't handle these guys without the Intersect. I only got that one move!
- Sarah?
- [SILENCED g\*n]
- Mom?
- Come with me if you wanna live.
- Chuck: Okay, we're here, we're safe. Start answering some of my questions.
- We can't stay here. Volkoff has contacts in the CIA. We have to move.
- We should believe you. Last time, trusting you worked out well.
- Chuck, I didn't want to have to do the things I did.
- Most moms don't have to explain to their kids why they sh\*t them.
- Or tied them up and blew up their home.
- I didn't have a choice.
- There's always a choice.
- You could choose to let me...
- Chuck, maybe we can step outside for a second?
- We're running out of...
- Ah. You're not going anywhere.
- What happened to putting the past behind you?
- You wanna be able to trust your mom, not worry she'll sh\*\*t you in the face.
- Which is why you should stay out of this.
- There is something she's not telling us and we're not gonna get to it with you.
- I'm perfectly capable of doing this...
- [CHUCK GROANS]
- Mike: This is what a successful Black Friday looks like.
- You did it, son. I couldn't be prouder.
- It was hairy for a minute, but...
- Like, we ran out of 7G smartphones.
- But you remembered what I taught you.
- No phone? Sell them a head spa. No head spa? Sell them a used phone.
- Heh, heh. Exactly.
- Now... I brought this for you.
- Really?
- Just think of this as my fatherly love... in the form of fresh meatballs smothered in marinara... with gooey delicious provolone melting all over it.
- Wow, that is just a terrible metaphor... heh, heh, but I forgive you because it smells delicious.
- You deserve it.
- Okay. All right.
- I should go. I'm getting a little misty.
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Okay.
- Excuse me? Can you help me?
- Oh, jeez. I'm sorry, miss. We're closed.
- Well, I just wanna buy one of those 7G smartphones.
- Completely sold out of those.
- Please.
- I'll do anything.
- Uh, not that I'm not flattered, but who has two thumbs and is taken?
- [POPPING]
- Boop. This guy. Okay. Happy holidays.
- [SIGHS]
- [WHISPERS] Okay.
- Lester: This is our finest plan yet, Jeffrey.
- Smartphones that can also send and receive calls?
- I mean, people will do anything for these bad boys.
- Who have you been talking to?
- Stop being paranoid.
- Remember, this is not stealing.
- This is pre-buying with funds we don't have... which we will post-pay when we sell these phones on eBay.
- And then, my friend?
- Use the profits to make our demo.
- Jeffster!
- [BOTH BABBLING]
- Lester: Yes, yes, yes!
- Stop. Listen.
- I'm gonna go see if the coast is clear, then we'll move these out of here.
- Totally.
- Knock, knock. Brought some carrots.
- Rich in vitamin A, good for retinal development.
- Thank you. I'm starving.
- I bet.
- You've been working on this nonstop.
- You figure anything out?
- Well, more or less.
- My dad left a sort of memory problem. He was using the brain to store data.
- He was approaching it from an engineer's perspective.
- Human memory works differently.
- So a few adjustments and 36 hours of MRls later... voil√°.
- Wait, are you telling me you just solved the problem your dad left you?
- No. I solved it 20 minutes ago... and then, suddenly, his computer just locked off. Look.
- Devon: "One or 11? "
- What does that mean?
- I tried putting in each of the numbers. Another mystery, courtesy of my dad.
- Why would he leave this for me?
- Brain scans? I mean, this is obviously spy-related.
- We should talk to Chuck.
- No. I don't wanna give him any reason to get back into that life.
- What do you wanna do?
- [SIGHS]
- I don't know.
- We know these men were high-level Volkoff assassins.
- So, what's your game here?
- I was ordered to use those three to k\*ll Chuck.
- I had to sh\*\*t them to save Chuck's life.
- Protecting him has always been my number-one priority.
- [PHONE RINGING]
- SARAH [OVER PHONE]: Hello?
- Ask her how disabling the Intersect... is about protecting me.
- Are we gonna do this now?
- I'm just saying. Tell her to explain that.
- Fine.
- [SARAH SIGHS]
- So how was shutting off the Intersect meant to protect Chuck?
- It was meant to stop him from following me.
- [PHONE RINGING]
- Yes?
- I went out on missions unprotected.
- She's made me more vulnerable.
- I don't think this is helping.
- Is that him?
- Let me talk to him.
- Here.
- This is why we didn't want you in this interrogation.
- Let the grown-ups do their work.
- Fine. Hanging up now.
- Good. I'm glad.
- I'm gladder.
- Huh. Where were we?
- Tell us what it is that you're really after.
- Volkoff will know that they are dead, which means he will come here for me.
- We are not safe here.
- [PHONE RINGING]
- Chuck: Sarah? Sarah, pick up the phone.
- I was able to get what you wanted.
- Fantastic.
- Now, you said you were willing to do anything for it.
- First... I need you to shave my back.
- I can't reach the middle.
- Lester: Thomas Jefferson Barnes.
- Hey, Jeffrey... what are you doing?
- Getting what I deserve.
- Getting what you... ? Real... ?
- Excuse me. Listen to me.
- We can't afford to let strangers shave your back, Jeffrey.
- Not now, when we're this close to making our dreams come true.
- You're so pretty.
- I...
- And we're secure.
- MAN 1: Come on, guys. Come on. Right over there.
- MAN 2: Bring it in. MAN 3: Let's move.
- MAN 4: Yeah.
- Good work.
- Now let's get what we came for.
- MAN 1: Line them up together.
- MAN 2: This way.
- There's something she's not telling us.
- You're not doing yourself any favors by calling.
- I'm sorry. If you wanna go back in, I promise I'll stay off the phone.
- [PHONE RINGING]
- One sec. I just gotta...
- It's... I'm not calling you. Just... Morgan.
- I can't really talk. We're in the middle of a crisis here.
- I don't know what crisis you're in.
- But mine's carrying AK-47 s. They just took over the store.
- [OVER PHONE] Hey. Did you... ? Chuck? Chuck?
- Alexei Volkoff.
- Did you just say Volkoff?
- Volkoff is here?
- Morgan, I need you to hide.
- Do not come out until I... Morgan?
- [STATIC CRACKLING OVER PHONE]
- Volkoff cut off our cell phones.
- That's always Volkoff's first move, k\*ll all communications.
- Hmm.
- What are we gonna do? Morgan is still up there.
- Lucky for us, this is a state-of-the-art CIA facility.
- Fully prepared for an internal attack.
- We've less than a minute. Impress me.
- Okay, let's do some damage.
- Attention, members of the CIA.
- You've k\*ll three of my men and captured my best agent.
- I'm here to get her back.
- Keep talking, commie. It's party time.
- CASEY [OVER PA]: Mr. Volkoff, exit the Buy More now.
- K. K. , go.
- Automated Voice [OVER PA]: w\*apon system online.
- Better dead than red.
- Automated Voice: w\*apon disabled.
- Casey, what's happening?
- Must have hacked in. My g\*n are down.
- Understand, this is not a negotiation.
- Give me Frost... or I'll k\*ll you all... starting with the fat man and the Indian.
- God.
- Progress?
- Scans revealed an elevator shaft behind the home-theater room.
- K. K. Can't seem to override the system and it's 3 feet of carbide steel.
- [VOLKOFF SIGHS]
- Start cutting.
- Chuck: Okay, good news, bad news.
- Jeff and Lester are about to die, bad news.
- Good news, I've manually locked down all entrances to Castle.
- Bad news, we're sitting ducks down here.
- They're cutting in through the elevator shaft.
- Now, we have one option. The defenses have a manual override.
- They're buried deep in the access tunnels.
- We can override the lockdown, bring our defenses back up.
- Now, you two stay down here with Mama B.
- When Volkoff calls to negotiate, buy me some time.
- Why would Volkoff pull off an as\*ault on a CIA facility for one agent?
- He's gotta be after something bigger.
- Well, whatever it is... there's something my mom's not telling us.
- I'm not lying. He wants me.
- He'll take on the entire CIA, risk his whole organization, for one agent?
- He...
- [OVER SPEAKERPHONE] I need to know that Frost is still alive.
- Put her on the phone.
- Chuck, you have to turn me over to him.
- Please trust me.
- I don't.
- This is Charles Carmichael.
- I'm the only one you'll be speaking with.
- Charles. So good to hear your voice again.
- Now, I know how scared you must be... cut off from help with a madman closing in on you.
- So let me offer you a simple suggestion.
- Hand Frost the damn phone!
- [WHISPERING] He wants to talk to you.
- Alexei, I'm here.
- Frost.
- Thank God.
- Are they treating you all right?
- I'm fine.
- Did they feed you?
- Yes.
- Was it good?
- It was delicious.
- Tell them they better continue treating you well... or I'll make life very uncomfortable for them very soon.
- Tell them... that I'm not leaving here without you, my love.
- [LINE DISCONNECTS]
- Wha... ?
- "My love"?
- What does that mean?
- It means that Alexei Volkoff is in love with me.
- He's in love with you? He called you "my love"?
- Who is Volkoff to you? Your boyfriend? Is he the reason you left Dad?
- No.
- Alexei and I have never been together. It's just he...
- He's in love with me, that's all.
- That's all? Got it. Got it. Great.
- No, you don't get it.
- Sarah, explain to him.
- If you were working undercover with the biggest psychopath... and that psychopath falls in love with you...
- That would make me a major intelligence asset.
- I see. So that's why you've been gone from my life since I was 9?
- Chuck, I'm a spy.
- It was my mission.
- You've been close to Volkoff. Why didn't you take him out?
- My mission was to take down the network, not the man.
- Which is something I still might be able to do.
- But if you want to save yourself and your friends, turn me over to him.
- You have no choice.
- Chuck, wait.
- Hey, are you okay?
- How can I trust anything she says?
- Every time I do, I wind up getting sh\*t or almost blown up.
- I haven't been stabbed yet.
- Going undercover for so long and staying loyal is a hard thing to do.
- I got lucky. I was assigned to you. Your mom got Volkoff.
- You think Volkoff really is in love with her?
- If he is, I bet he would rather negotiate with us than risk her getting hurt.
- I might be mad at my mom, really mad, but I'm never gonna hurt her.
- You and I know that, but Volkoff doesn't.
- It might help us to buy more time for Casey.
- Casey.
- Morgan, what are you doing in here?
- And where are your shoes?
- What... ? Funny story. I was sitting...
- Never mind about the shoes.
- Where are Chuck and Sarah and what is going on?
- Volkoff's taken control of the Buy More.
- He's captured Tweedledumb and Tweedledumber.
- He's gonna k\*ll them if we don't give him Chuck's mom.
- Jeff and Lester? We gotta save them.
- Mm-hm.
- If we don't get those g\*n working, we're gonna be k\*ll.
- No, no, no. You're absolutely right. Okay.
- I'll go. Get the g\*n running, I'll save Jeff and Lester.
- Morgan, that's a stupid idea.
- Maybe, but I'm not just gonna sit here on all fours and watch those two die.
- Now, wish me luck.
- Wait.
- You might need that.
- Good thinking.
- Muzzle.
- Right. I got it, I got it.
- [RINGING]
- Yes, Charles?
- You want Frost... and we have her.
- If you do what we ask, she doesn't get hurt.
- But if you don't do what we ask... then bad things are going to happen to her.
- Very bad things.
- Like...
- Just very bad things. We'll leave it at that.
- Is that a threat?
- Let me show you something.
- This is a thermite-TH3 incendiary expl\*sive.
- When it's detonated, the temperatures will exceed 4000 degrees Fahrenheit.
- Metal will boil.
- I'm gonna drop it down the elevator shaft... and it will incinerate every single one of you... including my beloved Frost.
- I'd rather she die than have to live without me.
- Give her back to me... and I'll let you live.
- That's how you threaten someone, Charles.
- So much for buying Casey more time.
- Okay, come on.
- Ow!
- [GRUNTING]
- Hey. You came for me. Thank you.
- [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]
- No time to talk, Grimes.
- Wait. No. No.
- [SIGHS]
- They were supposed to sell these. What is wrong with those guys?
- Man: Let's go. Move.
- Tell your men to back off.
- Don't be afraid.
- I told you I'd let you live and I meant it.
- But you should know... I have your friend Casey.
- Put down your w\*apon.
- Frost.
- Thank you for coming for me.
- I had no choice.
- Now, there is just one small matter to deal with.
- [GRUNTING]
- Chuck.
- What happened to letting us go?
- I lied.
- But in my defense, you threatened the woman I love.
- Frost... I hope you think this is a romantic gesture.
- Alexei, you can't.
- Why not? You like romance.
- Because... Charles is my son.
- Really?
- Really.
- Really?
- Really.
- Volkoff: Really?
- Really.
- [CHUCK PANTING]
- So this is why he isn't dead.
- Mary: I'm sorry, Alexei.
- My one weakness is my love for my son.
- And he knows this and uses it against me.
- Don't be hard on yourself.
- We always expect the best from the ones we love.
- And rarely get it.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Alexei, you run a multinational criminal organization.
- There's no room for family.
- Especially family that works for the CIA.
- What did you think I was going to do?
- Sir, there's an incoming call on the Buy...
- Shut up!
- From an Ellie Bartowski.
- Any relation, this Ellie Bartowski... Mr. Bartowski?
- Yeah.
- No.
- No. Yeah. Distant, distant relative.
- Who... She lives in Alaska, I think. Come to think of it, she's in Bangladesh.
- You don't wanna...
- Not necessary.
- ELLIE [OVER SPEAKERPHONE]: Chuck?
- Hey, it's me. Are you coming for dinner tonight?
- I'm kind of, uh... I'm kind of tied up here at work, sis.
- No, you have to come. I have so much food here.
- We didn't get to have a family Thanksgiving dinner. It'll be fun. Please?
- I'll try my best.
- Okay, great. I'll see you soon.
- Volkoff: So... a son and a daughter.
- [MARY SIGHS]
- You didn't think I could have a relationship with your family?
- Kids love me.
- I'll prove you wrong.
- Charles...
- Chuck.
- [CHUCK GRUNTS]
- Call your sister back. Tell her you're coming to dinner... and you're bringing some guests.
- Okay.
- Okay, I know it's tough. We just have to be calm.
- You just brought a psychotic k\*ll to your pregnant daughter's house.
- Considering the circumstances, I'm pretty calm.
- Everything's gonna be fine. You just have to trust me.
- I've heard that before.
- Alexei, you do understand... that my daughter and her husband are civilians?
- Of course.
- I don't wanna frighten your family.
- I just want to get to know them.
- [KNOCKING ON DOOR]
- Hi.
- Mom.
- I was telling you I was gonna bring some surprise guests.
- So, surprise!
- Devon: Hey.
- I'm Devon, your son-in-law.
- Hey.
- Devon: Come on in.
- Mary: Hello, nice to meet you.
- I want you to have fun tonight.
- But if I get the feeling that you're plotting against me...
- I need this dinner to be perfect, understand?
- Yeah, I think we do.
- I think you don't.
- If it isn't perfect, I'll take it out on the people you love.
- [BOBBY HELMS' "JINGLE BELL ROCK" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
- Well, this has been quite the surprise.
- I can't remember the last time we had you here for Thanksgiving, Mom.
- Jingle bell, jingle bell rock It was 1990.
- You were 12... Chuck was 9.
- The turkey was overcooked.
- Heh, heh. That's right. That's right. I remember that.
- I, however, thought the turkey tasted fine.
- Jingle bell...
- So, Alexei, you work with my mom. Can I... ?
- I mean, am I allowed to ask what happened to her?
- Dancin' and prancin'
- Well, it's complicated.
- Let me explain.
- Well, Ellie, in our business, sometimes good people are confused for bad... and bad for good.
- But fortunately, being your mother's handler... I was able to convince the CIA that she is good.
- In a one-horse sleigh Right, Sarah?
- Right. Absolutely.
- And that's why your mother is free to go now.
- Well, that's good news, right?
- [ALL CHUCKLE]
- Volkoff: Yes.
- I know how painful it was for your mother... when she had to leave you years ago.
- I know how painful it must have been for you too.
- And your brother.
- Ellie: Thank you for helping our mom.
- You can't imagine what you've done for this family.
- Volkoff: Families come first.
- Come on. Think, Morgan, think.
- There's no Chuck, no Sarah.
- It's up to you to save them.
- How? How?
- Ellie: Okay.
- Okay. Uh, movie. Movie.
- Volkoff: Yes.
- Gosh. Um...
- Ellie: Three words.
- Sarah: Sounds like...
- Ellie: Sounds like...
- Hey, buddy, you having a good time?
- Are you kidding? This Alexei is totally awesome.
- First guy I've met who's free-climbed K2, no oxygen. Hardcore, bro.
- Yeah. Yeah, he's something else, isn't he? Heh.
- You know what else he is?
- An international arms dealer and a very, very bad man.
- We're in terrible danger. Don't freak out. Bourne Identity.
- No!
- Ugh. So close.
- Dude, this is not funny.
- Yeah, well, it's also not a joke, Devon, okay?
- I didn't wanna have to tell you this. I'm spying again and I need your help.
- Batman Forever?
- Wrong again, Charles.
- You really should make some guesses, otherwise it looks suspicious.
- Uh, Bourne Identity?
- Ellie: Three words.
- I said that.
- Whatever. What are you thinking, bringing this guy home?
- I'm sorry. It's not my fault. It wasn't my decision.
- I can't make a move without setting off Alexei... but you're a civilian. He won't suspect you of anything.
- Devon, I know you're the world's worst liar.
- But right now... I need you to be awesome.
- What do you want me to do?
- Hey, looks like we're out of sugar.
- Hey, Chuck, you got any at your place?
- Just getting some sugar.
- [CHUCKLES]
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh. Cold.
- WOMAN'S VOICE [OVER SPEAKER]: CIA emergency alert activated.
- Wow, that is surprisingly soothing.
- Got the sugar.
- Oh, nice.
- Sarah: I'll take that.
- Shouldn't your cell phone be ringing?
- Huh? Right.
- Huh. It's the hospital.
- Hello?
- Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. Well, if you need us, we'll be right there.
- What is it?
- A bus accident on the 101. They need all the hands they can get.
- Oh, God.
- I'm so sorry that we have to take off like this.
- It was a wonderful evening. You're so...
- [KISSING]
- Go save some lives.
- Ha, ha. Okay.
- Devon: Oh.
- It was great to see you, Mom.
- Talk to you soon.
- Okay.
- Mary: Okay.
- Bye!
- See you soon.
- Such a sad end to a wonderful evening.
- You had to go and alert the CIA, didn't you?
- Don't move.
- You do know that the nearest tactical response team... is over 10 minutes away?
- Until then... anything could happen.
- Mary: Drop it, Sarah.
- Mom, seriously? You're betraying me again?
- Chuck: No, stop.
- Alexei, we've had our dinner.
- You've met the family.
- We're leaving.
- But what kind of potential father-in-law would I be if I didn't set an example?
- Chuck has to learn, you make a threat, you follow through on it.
- [g\*n CLICKS]
- I didn't really have to do that... but I just really like the sound.
- Alexei, stop.
- My love?
- What are you doing?
- This is exactly why I didn't tell you about my family.
- You don't know how to love someone. You only know how to control them.
- But you should know... that I could never love a man who would do anything to hurt my son.
- So drop it.
- Alexei, you know that I am loyal to you.
- But I will not return with you... until you promise me that my family and their friends... will remain safe.
- And if they don't... I will end you.
- [CHUCKLES]
- Volkoff: You see?
- That is a real threat.
- Chuck, I'm sorry for everything.
- I hope someday you'll trust me.
- Mom.
- I already do.
- Barbara: Roger that, Mr. Volkoff.
- Bad guys... I surrender.
- I surrender.
- I surrender.
- Yippee-ki-yay...
- Yippee-ki... yay.
- Yippee-ki-yay.
- Yip...
- Okay.
- I surrender.
- You're free to go.
- What?
- What?
- Volkoff's orders. We're out.
- I'm unbelievable.
- What should we do with these two?
- What's going on?
- You two have some sort of orgy in here last night?
- I don't think...
- Jeff: Yes.
- [SIGHS]
- Tell me you weren't planning on selling these on eBay.
- [SCOFFS]
- Lester: That depends on what you mean by "eBay. "
- Then you wouldn't have any problem getting them out on the sales floor?
- Let's say 10 minutes?
- And get them fan stickers off them boxes.
- [BOTH GROAN]
- I wish I would've trusted my mom... instead of being so angry with her the whole time... and now she's gone.
- She can't come back, not until Volkoff is destroyed.
- He knows too much.
- She's the only thing keeping us safe right now.
- [DOOR CLOSES]
- Hey, bro, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.
- Uh, hey, what's up?
- What were you thinking?
- Not only are you spying again, but you bring it back to our apartment?
- I had to lie to Ellie, and I hate lying.
- I'm sorry, okay? I really am. I was trying to protect my mom.
- Things went sideways...
- Stop, okay? Just stop. I don't wanna know.
- I don't want this spy stuff near Ellie ever again.
- Never. Never ever again.
- She doesn't want it near you either. Understand?
- So this conversation never took place.
- This is one of my father's laptops.
