- (engine starts)

- (horn blaring)
- (speaking Italian)
- (g\*n clicks)
- (silenced g\*n)
- (speaking German)
- (beeping)
- Good.
- (beeps, bell dings)
- Oh, yeah. Rose petals! Nice touch. Really?
- You don't think it's too much? It's me and Alex's first Valentine's Day together, and I don't want to overdo it. Nah.
- Is that a bearskin rug?
- Yeah, yeah. I got it at Big Lots!
- Had to buy it in bulk though, so if you know anyone who wants a bearskin rug, I got eight of them.
- (beeping) Oh, that's good.
- Okay, here we go.
- 8:00 sharp. So, game plan review.
- For the next 90 minutes, you and Alex take the living room while Sarah and I are in our bedroom.
- Then at precisely... 9:30, Alex and I will saunter off to our room leaving you and Sarah ample time to watch Love Actually.
- Ah, yes! A hit with ladies around the world.
- And men.
- And don't worry about your soufflés, 'cause I will keep an eye on them, and make sure they rise to perfection.
- (knocking on door) Alex. Okay.
- Good luck. You, too. Okay.
- Oh, wait! Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
- Just one more thing.
- It's Valentine's Day... we both have girlfriends.
- (goofy voice): I know!
- Okay. Go.
- (whispering): We did it.
- (whispering): Thank God.
- I haven't slept in three days.
- You know what else we haven't done in three days... or three months?
- Are you saying it's time for Mommy and Daddy to celebrate Valentine's?
- Can we not call ourselves Mommy and Daddy... in the bedroom?
- How 'bout... "Who's your Daddy? "
- Still no.
- (cries)
- Let Clara cry it out.
- It'll prepare her for the real world.
- Or at least, the nursery.
- You're such a good dad.
- And you're a good mom.
- (Clara continues crying)
- Mm!
- (crying louder)
- I can't do it! I can't do it either.
- What do you need, little baby?
- Come on.
- ♪ ♪
- (Chuck hums along)
- I'm gonna treat you so good, you're never gonna let me go.
- Pretty Woman reference.
- Isn't that movie about a prostitute?
- Yeah, but Julia Roberts is so delightful, isn't she?
- Mm-hmm. Wait for it.
- Boom!
- Homemade, baby. Well, I have a surprise for you underneath this, you know. Oh, do you really?
- Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Well...
- But first, I made you a little something.
- Chocolate strawberries.
- They're in the fridge.
- (groans)
- Morgan and Alex have the living room.
- What do you mean "have"?
- You know, like, in college, when you got to hang a sock on the door... ?
- A sock? Why would you do that?
- You know what? Doesn't matter. I'm just going to go out there.
- It's only been-- what? -- like five minutes.
- Not a lot could have happened by now.
- (Alex and Morgan breathe heavily, rhythmically)
- (cell phone buzzes)
- Did you hear that?
- Alex: I did! (buzzing stops)
- It was like our souls are so close they're vibrating.
- (whispering): That's what it is.
- (whispering): Yeah. That's exactly what it is.
- (passionate breathing)
- (mouthing)
- Morgan: Okay, okay. You know what?
- Throw the chocolate sauce on me.
- Alex: Okay. MORGAN: Get in there.
- (Morgan whispers) ALEX: Okay.
- (heavy, pulsing breathing)
- Morgan: What does it mean?
- Morgan: Okay.
- (Alex laughs giddily)
- (whispers): Surprise.
- Morgan: What does it mean?
- Oh, I agree, General.
- There better be a damn good reason why they're not picking up the phone.
- I'm going to get them right now.
- Unprofessional.
- (laughter, passionate gasping)
- (growls)
- What was that?
- Oh, my God!
- Dad! Hi... What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- (stammers)
- Um, Sarah had these chocolate-covered, uh... so I was...
- Come on, Ch... Chuck, you said I have the living room for 90 minutes! "Have"?
- What do you mean, "have"?
- Have... in a biblical way... Um, we were, um... not a biblical way, in a spiritual... Spiritual...
- Beckman. Mission. Now.

- (whimpers)
- It's not a physical thing. It's, you know.
- It's-it's an emotional exchange.
- Casey: Drop it, Grimes.
- We're having company?
- Chuck: Hey, what the...
- Who... who are those guys?
- NCS. They're making some... additions to Castle.
- Ooh! Maybe they got my comment card about the eucalyptus steam room.
- They're covert ops, Bartowski.
- And they have nothing to do with your mission.
- Tonight, there was supposed to be a joint CIA/NSA/INTERPOL bust; Alexei Volkoff's three most trusted lieutenants.
- We tracked them down through his Hydra Network, but by the time we located them, they were already dead.
- And we believe the k\*ll was this man: Boris Kaminsky. We think Boris may be trying to take control of Volkoff Industries by eliminating anyone else who could make a claim to power.
- Is there even anyone left to make a claim?
- Possibly.
- Volkoff left detailed information on every contact in the Hydra Network, except for a woman named Vivian McArthur.
- I never heard of her when I was undercover there.
- That doesn't surprise me.
- We believe that Volkoff was purposely hiding her, because she is his chosen successor.
- Which means Vivian is Boris' next target.
- Well, do we know anything about her?
- The only connection we have found between her and Volkoff is a manor in Somerset, England.
- There's a party there tonight.
- It's a perfect time for Boris to attack.
- You need to get to Vivian before he does and bring her back to Castle.
- Uh, quick question, uh, GB.
- This party, is there a theme that we should dress towards?
- EMCEE (over P. A. ): Step right up!
- The ringmaster has arrived.
- I'll be taking you through this little journey this evening.
- Step right up! Sarah, I gotta tell you, masquerades really creep me out, okay?
- It's like Eyes Wide Shut,  but, you know, not so boring.
- Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Kubrick fan. Chuck, come on. It's just a bunch of socialites wearing masks.
- Yeah, it could be that.
- Or, it's a sex-crazed orgy party, where they don't want you to see their faces, or know their secrets.
- No, no. I've been to those kinds of parties, and it doesn't look anything like this.
- What? What, what, what, what? Really?
- Come on, Chuck, don't be ridiculous.
- Look, we've got to find Vivian before Boris does. You know what that means?
- Time to mingle.
- Good luck. Huh? No.
- Don't you think we should stay together?
- Wow.
- Do I taste a hint of pear?
- Elderflower liqueur with some muddled thyme.
- Woman: You're an impressive bartender.
- It's like you were born to do this, no?
- Woman: Thanks for the drink.
- She's right.
- This is fantastic.
- Well, it doesn't surprise me. I mean, with Chuck being a full-blown agent now, and he and Sarah always taking point.
- Kind of leaves you stuck here, behind the bar.
- I'm an integral part of this team.
- Excuse me, barkeep.
- Might I have an extra lime?
- Ah, yes.
- Thank you, dear.
- And look who's talking.
- You live in Charah's apartment.
- That is our apartment, okay?
- And Chuck and Sarah like having me there. We have a very... special dynamic.
- (with British accent): Good evening.
- I am Charles Carmichael.
- Of the Worcestershire Carmichaels.
- Who might you be?
- I'm a heart.
- How darling.
- Don't mind if I do. Cheers.
- Hello. Enjoying the party?
- I am now.
- So how do you know Vivian?
- We share a mutual friend.
- Wake up, Grimes.
- You live with an engaged couple.
- It's like you're their kid.
- What? ! (splutters) That's ridiculous!
- Yes, living with a couple has its hiccups, you know, but things are actually really good at the apartment.
- Yeah? Well, they won't be that way for long.
- You gotta grow up sometime. Know what I'd do?
- I'd go out on top before the situation gets worse.
- (British accent): So, tell me, do you know where to find Vivian?
- Honestly, I don't even know what she looks like.
- It's the first party she's ever thrown.
- Interesting.
- (gasping) H-hot!
- Hot-hot-hot-hot!
- Good show, good show! Hot!
- Hot, but good. Very good! Ah!
- Yes, some wine would do good. Mmm!
- Please, help yourself.
- (normal voice): I'm so sorry.
- Was this yours? I can get you another one.
- It's okay. I've probably had enough.
- I can't stop thinking about that scene from Eyes Wide Shut.
- Yes! Right?
- And I like the idea of a theme party, but you put these people behind masks and it's just gets... ... creepy.
- Yeah. And a little sexual.
- Yeah. (laughs)
- So, Vivian-- do you know where she is by any chance?
- I haven't had the opportunity to say hello yet.
- I'm sorry, I don't.
- But if you do find her, please, be sure to let me know.
- I'd like to thank her for this exquisite party.
- So, how do you, uh, how do you know Vivian?
- I don't think anyone really knows her.
- And if this was her attempt to get to know the neighbors, we can safely say that she's failed miserably.
- Well, at least there's an open bar.
- I mean, she got that much right.
- Do you know where I can find... ?
- I found Boris.
- Casey, Boris is here.
- He's wearing a green mask.
- We're on it.
- Casey: We need to find Vivian.
- I think I may have just met her.
- ♪ ♪
- (horse splutters)
- Shh. CHUCK: Vivian.
- Vivian McArthur?
- What are you doing here?
- Whoa, what's going on?
- Ms. McArthur, we know you're an associate of Alexei Volkoff.
- Alexei Volkoff? What are you talking about?
- We're CIA. You need to come with us.
- We're here to protect you.
- Protect me from what?
- Get in the stable!
- Boris: Stop! Don't move!
- k\*ll the others. Take her alive. to lose these guys. Okay, we need What's the best way out of here?
- I don't know.
- Okay, the house is back that way.
- Casey, we're trapped in one of the stables. Copy that.
- We're on our way.
- Some things never change.
- Come on, Grimes. Let's go.
- Let's do this.
- (coughs)
- What the hell was that?
- This can all end now!
- Just give me the key, Vivian!
- What is he talking about? What key?
- Look, I don't know what's going on, but I have nothing to do with Alexei Volkoff.
- I haven't seen him in years.
- Then why does he pay for the manor that you live in?
- Because I'm his daughter.
- Vivian, if you want to live, give me the key.
- Look, can you please tell me what this is all about?
- Quick version: your father is an international arms dealer and m\*rder and all-around bad guy, okay?
- No, no, my father is an oil executive.
- Okay, look, we'll explain it later.
- I have an idea. Chuck, get ready to flash.
- (g\*n)
- Man: Those are g\*n!
- Sounds like there's g\*n outside!
- They're trapped in the back stables! Come on!
- What're you doing?
- We're saving you.
- No, we're saving you! Get in!
- You two are amazing! You are the best spies in the world!
- (tires squeal)
- Good Lord!
- What happened to you two?
- You smell like vomit and Cheerios.
- We had a baby.
- We need help.
- Follow me.
- Luckily, we have a sleep-slash-baby aisle.
- You need the new Sleep Sheep.
- Look at this.
- It says it can record mama's soothing voice for the baby.
- So there you go.
- (crying stops)
- ♪ ♪
- What is that?
- I'm sorry, Jeff and Lester got their hands on one of these Sleep Sheep and did some recording of their own.
- Jeff has some strange nap habits.
- I'll have them shut it off.
- No, no, no. No. Thanks for your help.
- That's exactly why I got myself snipped.
- Babe, that song...
- We need that.
- Okay, I'll just go ask 'em for it.
- Wait, wait, wait! What if they say no?
- They can't say no.
- We should take it.
- Are you sure about this? Oh, yeah.
- Good, 'cause I have a plan.
- Eleanor Bartowski Woodcomb.
- Hillary Rodham Clinton.
- Oh, are we not playing that game?
- We are not.
- Sorry, I came in here to breast-feed. somewhere else tohnurse. Maybe I could go Perhaps the back room?
- (whispers): We should follow her.
- Well, I believe her.
- Everything she says checks out.
- I do, too.
- It seems like she has no idea who her father actually is.
- I think he lied to her her entire life.
- Then why does Boris think she has this "key"?
- Morgan: I was wondering, is it possible I could stay with you tonight?
- No, no, it's fine. You know, it's just... they didn't get to enjoy their Valentine's Day either, and it's their apartment, too, you know?
- Listen, I'll, I'll handle the paperwork again if you guys take care of that.
- Since you two got engaged, Mr. Sensitivity might be feeling a little... irrelevant.
- I'll go talk to him.
- No, no, let me talk to Morgan.
- You debrief Vivian. You know, if he feels like the third wheel, maybe it's because the two of us only ever hang out when you're around.
- You know, Morgan and I could use some one-on-one time.
- It'll be fun!
- Okay.
- Have fun.
- Let me ask you a question.
- You and I don't usually do this kind of thing, so I was just wondering if there's a reason that you're here.
- No! No, no...
- I was just looking to... hang.
- Cool, cool. Let's hang.
- (both chuckle)
- Okay.
- So, uh, I know you guys like having these toys around...
- Toys?
- Yeah. Maybe we can play with them.
- Roar!
- Bang! Bang!
- (growling)
- Uh, yeah, sorry, sorry.
- No offense, please, but these, um, they're not toys.
- They're collectibles.
- They're not for playing. Oh.
- Chuck and I had to pool all our money together to get these guys.
- Original 1977 Kenner line.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- They're really fun... to look at.
- The trick is Chewie always goes on Han's right side.
- Anyway, I've been arranging them this way since I was about 13, if you can believe that.
- They're toys! They're just toys, aren't they? !
- No, no, they're collectibles. They're just toys!
- It's different. They have... value!
- No, no, no. No, wait a minute.
- Wait, you're not here to hang!
- You're here 'cause I'm a third wheel! Casey was right!
- Oh, my God! I play with toys! I live with a couple!
- I am a child!
- I'm like your child.
- You guys are like my parents. Oh, my God!
- No, Morgan, please, it's okay. Calm down. It's fine.
- I mean, look at this. I can't...
- I can't do this anymore.
- I have to grow up.
- I have to move out.
- That's what I have to do.
- I have to go.
- So, my father, he actually k\*ll people?
- Did you spend much time with the man?
- Honestly? No.
- He put me into more schools than I can count, sent me on trips all over the world, he made sure every minute of every day was occupied.
- But he was never a part of my life.
- Or, or, uh, he was trying to protect you from the very dark and dangerous world that he was a part of.
- Yeah, maybe.
- And now you have a chance to do what you want.
- Right.
- Now I just have to figure out what that actually is.
- I mean, after the party, I'm sure we can safely cross being a socialite off the list.
- I can't believe I still don't know what to do with my life.
- Can I not be a spy for a second?
- Oh, please.
- Okay.
- You should have seen my life a few years ago. I was working a dead-end job, I was living with my sister, and then something... an opportunity, just fell in my lap.
- Afternoon, Colonel.
- Paperwork, bartending, any chance that your k\*ll are being wasted here?
- You were at the bar.
- What are you doing in Castle?
- Director Jane Bentley, NCS.
- I was in England to observe.
- You see, I'm not like Agents Bartowski or Walker, even General Beckman.
- I see your true potential.
- You started working for the NSA because you were America's best sharpsh\*\*ter.
- And now... you're so much more than this, Colonel.
- It seemed that your team doesn't need you anymore.
- When are you finally going to accept that and move on?
- Getting to a point?
- I'm putting together a new team and I want you to lead them.
- What's the directive?
- You're curious. Good.
- I'll be in touch.
- Chuck: I never expected this to be my life.
- But here I am and-- I'm happy.
- And if you give it some time, I'm sure that you can find that for you as well.
- So what happens now?
- Okay, well, now, probably the best thing to do is get you into a CIA safe house.
- I just told you I spent my entire life being hidden away by my father.
- This is serious, okay?
- This is very, very serious business.
- Boris has gone after your father and is taking out everyone that was close to him.
- He knows where you live.
- Wait... Okay, so why don't we use that to our advantage?
- What do you mean? Use me as bait.
- No. This is the first opportunity I've had to take control of my life.
- I can't let it slip away.
- Charles, I know it's asking a lot, and I know that I'm a Volkoff--
- Will you help me?
- Please?
- Yes.
- Yes, I'll help you.
- (both singing along with music)
- Ellie: Oh, my...
- Oh, honey, I think I'm losing my mind.
- I know.
- I used to love this song.
- Okay, it's been two hours.
- If I turn it off, do you think Clara will stay asleep?
- It couldn't hurt to try.
- (music stops)
- (both sighing)
- (Clara fussing)
- (crying)
- Hey, it could be worse.
- Really? Could it be?
- Hey, we're doctors.
- We've gone without sleep before.
- We were born for this.
- Okay, you're right.

- Hey... Morgan, Morgan buddy, I got... I got to pack for the mission, but Sarah called me and said you were moving out.
- So I told her that was, of course, completely... ridiculous.
- Morgan: No, she's right.
- I'm doing it.
- I'm gonna move out.
- No, but see, that's totally ridiculous.
- That's what I'm trying to say...
- Morgan, look, I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry about busting in on you and Alex on Valentine's Day with the bearskin rug and the...
- That's not the point. The point is, you had the living room for 90 minutes. We had a deal, I broke it. I'm so sorry.
- I am not moving out because of what happened on Valentine's Day.
- No, man, I'm--
- I'm moving because it's just, it's been a long time coming, you know.
- Neither of us wants to admit it, but...
- Admit-- admit what? What do you mean?
- Chuck, do you realize-- you and Sarah are going to be married in a few months?
- My friend-- married.
- You guys should have your own place.
- It's ridiculous.
- You should have your own place.
- And you know what, I have-- I have a serious girlfriend now.
- Who, by the way, takes me seriously.
- I just think it's time we both grow up.
- We are grown up!
- (chuckles) Come on.
- Why wouldn't you want to live with your two best friends?
- I'm happy. Aren't you happy? I'm happy.
- Of course I'm happy. But you know what, we were both happy when your father let us build a fort in the attic and sleep there all summer.
- That was a great summer.
- That was a good time.
- But things change, and uh...
- It's not really a bad thing.
- I think it's going to be okay.
- Where you going to go?
- I don't know.
- I got to finish packing up, and then I'm going to head out that door, dude, and I'm just going to open myself up to the universe.
- So, moving to your mom's?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Pretty much straight over.
- (sighs)
- Come on, this is okay. This is okay.
- Bright side-- this is not going to be hard to split up, okay?
- I've done most of it.
- From what I can figure, original super NES with Donkey Kong-- yours.
- Right, sure.
- And you'll be taking all the Hong Kong wire-fu and Miyazaki flicks, I assume?
- You know what happens when you assume.
- You're usually correct.
- Yeah.
- I guess really all that's left to take into consideration is our, uh...
- Han Solo and Chewbacca original '77
- Kenner line Collector's edition.
- (sighs)
- We went in on these together, buddy.
- Sure did.
- So we just each take one?
- No, no. That's crazy talk.
- We can't split 'em up.
- You can't separate Han and Chewie.
- Chewie's Han's first mate and constant companion.
- What up?
- Plus, they're worth more--
- (clearing throat) as a set, so...
- So we should sell them.
- Look, we don't need to decide right now.
- We can sleep on it.
- We can decide tomorrow. Totally.
- You know, I've got a big mission ahead of me.
- Right. Yeah, sure you do. And you know what, I have so much more packing to do, and...
- So I'll just-- I'll just--
- I'll just sleep with him tonight in my room.
- Not sleep with him.
- I wouldn't sleep with him.
- But he's going to be in my room, you know.
- And you know, Chewie will just stay with me.
- For the night, obviously.
- Obviously, obviously.
- Okay, then. Okay.
- (sighs)
- Sarah: Chuck, is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah. (clearing throat)
- I was just resting-- stretching. I was stretching.
- I find the wall to have... It's a lower lumbar thing.
- So I'm fine, I'm good.
- I'm sorry about Morgan.
- It's fine. I'm fine. He's fine.
- We're fine, so...
- How's the... ? (clearing throat)
- How's the packing for the mission going? You ready?
- Yeah.
- Casey: Well, if we're going to use Boris's knowledge of you to our advantage,  we're going to have to know the details.
- Walk us through an average day.
- We need to figure out when you're most vulnerable.
- Odds are Boris is doing the exact same thing right now.
- I wake up at 6:00.
- I make breakfast...
- Get dressed... and then I take Artemis out for a morning walk.
- Hello, Vivian.
- How do I look?
- You said the details are important, right?
- Mm-hmm.
- Here.
- Wear this.
- Are you okay?
- Well, shouldn't I be the one that goes into the woods?
- Chuck: Absolutely not.
- You should stay here with me, where it's safe.
- Everything's going to be fine. Trust me, Sarah's had years of training.
- And Casey will be watching my every move.
- I'm at the north gate.
- If Boris attacks, he'll do it here.
- This is it.
- Are you sure she'll be all right?
- Chuck: She always is.
- (wind whistling)
- Everything looks clear.
- I've got a mile until the gate.
- I'll be waiting.
- It's time. whoa.
- (wood cracking)
- Casey, something's wrong.
- I'm coming to you.
- (electronic whirring)
- (horse whinnying)
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Whoa!
- Coming, Walker.
- Casey: Sarah?
- What's happening? Casey, what's wrong?
- Is everything okay? You stay inside.
- You shouldn't be out here. It's too dangerous.
- Where's Sarah? Casey, where are you?
- 60 seconds out.
- Stay with Vivian. I'm on my way.
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm not doing this anymore.
- I'm not letting anyone die for me.
- I have spent my whole life hiding, Charles.
- It ends today.
- All right, let's do this.
- It's not Vivian.
- Then k\*ll her and find Vivian.
- She's the only one who has what we want.
- (r\*fle cocks)
- Walker.
- Walker? (groans)
- Sarah: There's too many of them.
- Go and get Chuck. okay? Shut up.
- You know I'm not leaving you here.
- Let's get you undercover.
- The road's just up ahead. You okay back there?
- Yeah-- yeah, yeah.
- We got company.
- I didn't spend ten years in equestrian school for nothing.
- Hi-yah!
- Hi-yah!
- Vivian: Do you think we lost them?
- I don't know.
- I know. No, we haven't!
- Hi-yah!
- Go, Artemis, go.
- Chuck: They're gaining on us.
- Come on, come on.
- Chuck: Listen, it's only a matter of time till they catch us.
- We're carrying too much weight.
- Well, what do you suggest?
- Plan B.
- Don't stop for anything.
- That was kind of cool.
- Sarah, Casey, where are you?
- (groans)
- (panting): Hey.
- Sarah...
- Where's Vivian?
- Chuck, I've reached the stables.
- We're on our way. Good. Stay there.
- Boris: Vivian.
- What do you know, Alexei Volkoff has a daughter.
- Must have taken a lot of work for them to keep you under wraps.
- Now just give me the key and I'll make it painless, I promise.
- My father never gave me any key.
- Yes, sweetheart, he did.
- When you were young.
- A token of his affection.
- Think hard, Vivian.
- Where is it?
- I don't know. None of this makes any sense.
- My father-- he didn't want me to be involved in any of this.
- Really? You were skeet sh\*\*ting at age seven, had your black belt at 13 and by the time you graduated from the London School of Economics, you were fluent in five languages.
- Your whole life your father's been grooming you.
- You are his succession plan.
- But he was wrong about you.
- See, he couldn't recognize what you really are-- an indecisive, weak little girl.
- (whinnying)
- Boris would have k\*ll you.
- Chuck: But now he's gone.
- And the rest of the lieutenants are dead.
- There's no one left to put the pieces of Volkoff Industries back together.
- What happens to it now?
- Without a leader, your father's empire is just an empty office building in Moscow.
- Chuck: Uh, Vivian, did Boris tell you anything about the key?
- What he was looking for?
- No, he didn't.
- Sorry.
- Casey: Time to go.
- You sure you'll be all right?
- Yeah. I can't thank you enough.
- For your advice, everything, Charles.
- I think it's time I figured out what to do with the rest of my life.
- Well, I'm sure you'll think of something.
- Bye.
- So this is, uh...
- This is it, huh?
- (sighs) Yeah.
- Yeah, this is it.
- Buddy, I know you're committed to moving out, and I get it, but I can't tell you enough how much Sarah and I love you.
- And love having you here.
- I love being here.
- It would be easy to leave if things sucked, or you know...
- And I need to grow up.
- Maybe that means leaving behind something that's great, too.
- The end of an era.
- It is indeed.
- Obviously, we'll still have game night, though.
- Every Monday.
- So what's going to happen with Han and Chewie, huh?
- Where are they? Did you sell them already?
- Well, I mean, Chewie's Han's first mate and constant companion.
- It just didn't seem right to separate them.
- More importantly, I thought they should stay in the family.
- You moved her into the nursery?
- You think she's ready for that?
- Honey, she's three months old.
- It's time for Clara to be in her own room.
- Besides, she's not alone in there.
- Which means, uh, we can be all alone.
- I am way ahead of you.
- I already have our outfits laid out and ready to go.
- I've been waiting for this since Clara was born.
- Casey: I want you to let you know, I'm not leaving my team.
- What I have here is good.
- Of course it is, but you've been here for four years.
- Longer than any other assignment you've had.
- These people mean a lot to you.
- For God's sake, you saved Agent Walker's life today.
- But you're not going to spend the rest of your career with this team, and you know it.
- Sooner or later, you're going to have to move on, Colonel.
- Why not today, when you can go out on top?
- I'm not leaving Burbank.
- You won't have to.
- The mission's right here.
- Huh.
