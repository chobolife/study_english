# Chuck Versus the Last Details

- Elle, you know that Intersect project that Dad was working on?
- I've been trying to figure it out for weeks. It's in my head.
- Ellie: From what I can piece together from his files,
- Dad used this program to input a new identity into an operative.
- But once he went undercover, something went wrong.
- The program took over. He became his cover identity.
- Chuck: Agent X is Alexei Volkoff?
- I have a company to run and I need leverage to run it.
- Victoria: And Norseman's the most dangerous w\*apon in the world.
- Rebuild the device as quickly as possible.
- That way, no one can touch me... ever.
- (door clangs open in distance, footfalls)
- Right this way, Miss Volkoff.
- Again, I'm sorry it's taken so long to reassemble The Norseman, but we've finally done it.
- I should hope so.
- Miss Volkoff's patience has worn very thin.
- Whoever's been trying to sabotage the operation certainly won't find their way down here.
- (w\*apon clicks)
- (w\*apon beeping)
- (chuckling)
- (w\*apon beeps loudly, then chirps a few times)
- (Riley sighs)
- Riley: Let me, Vivian.
- (w\*apon briefly whirs)
- If-if I may ask, who is the first subject going to be?
- (w\*apon clicks, whirs)
- Ow!
- Scientist: God! Ow!
- God! That noise!
- (whirring stops) Amazing!
- It located the correct DNA.
- It works! You know, dear, you really should try to do some of this dirty work yourself.
- You know, the head of Volkoff Industries needs a public face that spreads fear... and respect.
- Thank you.
- I appreciate your guidance.
- Riley: Of course, dear.
- After you.
- (door slams shut)
- (control line zips up, clanks ceiling)
- (door bursts open, g\*n cocking)
- I think the proper word right now would be "freeze. "
- Hello, Riley.
- Vivian, meet the woman who betrayed... your father for 20 years.
- Frost, welcome back!
- (g\*n smacks Mary, body hits floor)
- Good morning.
- You know what we have to do today?
- Mmm.
- Hunt someone? No.
- Blow something up? No, again.
- M-mm. Crawl through... sewers or... rat holes or underground lairs filled with sewage and/or rats?
- No, no, and no.
- Today we have a day off from the CIA.
- Today is about you and me and our wedding.
- (whispers): God, that's good.
- Mmm.
- (grunts)
- I'm sorry my bridesmaids couldn't help out more.
- Staging that coup is taking longer than expected.
- No. That's totally understandable.
- I mean, you know, coups take time.
- Anyway, uh, Awesome and Morgan and Ellie have basically taken over every chore we had, so...
- Your family is so sweet.
- They're bending over backwards to protect us from anything that's stressful.
- I know.
- Of course there is that one little thing I have to do that you don't get to know about, because I am adorable.
- (giggling): Yes, you are.
- Everything is perfect. Nothing can go wrong.
- Oh, Sarah, you didn't.
- (clang, crash)
- Morgan: Chuck!
- What? Why would you say that?
- Do you not watch movies?
- Well, I finally watched Mannequin.
- Oh, yeah? Did you like it?
- Morgan: Not good. Little help.
- Oh, my God!
- Ellie: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Honey, get him down. I got him.
- Yo!
- Captain: Okay, bud.
- Uh, just go limp; Fall into my arms. Go limp! You go limp. Chuck!
- Good morning. Everything...
- Everything fine here.
- Nothing to worry about.
- Morgan: Chuck! Do something!
- All right, everybody calm down. I got this.
- Whoo!
- (Chuck grunts)
- All right, here we go. Here.
- Here we go.
- Chuck: You all right? Yeah, all good.
- Your face is a little flush.
- Well, so... Coming down!
- Awesome! Impressive, isn't it?
- You seriously don't do any core work?
- Oh, just sitting up to reach the remote.
- Bitchin', dude. Right?
- Oh, okay? You know what?
- Chuck, Sarah, that was great, but seriously, back inside. I don't want you doing any work today. Go do something romantic, okay?
- Chuck: Right. Romantic, got it. Thank you.
- Morgan? Yes, ma'am.
- We have more twinkle lights, don't we? Yes, ma'am.
- Because this place has to be magical.
- Yes, ma'am. Magical! Morgan...
- Yes, ma'am.
- Honey, you're scaring me.
- Just keep it moving.
- I hear you, honey. I'll...
- I'll take care of it, I promise.
- Thank you, Dad.
- Guys, guys, I'm so sorry.
- But, uh, I need a little help here.
- I just told Ellie that I have all these extra twinkle lights, And I don't have actual twinkle lights, and she could yell at me.
- Oh, do you want me to just go out and get some for you?
- Can you do that?
- Yeah. - Really?
- Of course. You're the best.
- You are wonderful. Come here.
- And did I tell you... how very excited I am to have you as my very, very hot date to Chuck's wedding?
- See, I was figuring when this day came, I would be taking my mother.
- Yes, so... Well, your mom's gonna have to get her own date, because you are mine. Oh.
- (growls)
- (cell phone buzzes)
- Castle. Oh, no.
- "Oh, no, " what?
- What? Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-what? Do we have a mission? Today?
- I have a mission. Oh.
- Morgan: I'll just tell Ellie she's gonna have to do without us.
- No, no. Not you.
- (door opens)
- What's that about? (door shuts)
- Buon giorno...
- No. No. Casey, no way.
- We have the week off.
- You'd better be here to talk mimosas or wedding.
- I am.
- Your mom might not be able to make it.
- Why? What happened?
- She's been taken... by Vivian Volkoff.
- (tires screeching)
- ♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪
♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪
♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪
♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪
- (whimpers)
- Why was she even working on Volkoff?
- That was our case. She must be trying to protect us.
- Taking Vivian off our plate so we could focus on the wedding.
- Yeah, but look how she went in-- no backup, no contingency...
- Have you even spoken to her lately? No. I haven't even gotten a chance to ask her about my Dad and Agent X; find out if she knew about it.
- Where is she, Sarah?
- Well, this is her last communiqué.
- This is a mine in Colombia.
- Lot of bad guy traffic there for some reason.
- Okay, good. So we start there. It's a quick flight, and we'll have your mom back for the rehearsal dinner. - Sarah...
- I need my best man.
- You need your best man!
- Come on! Let's go get your mom, dude!
- Time to save the day.
- No, uh, Morgan, Morgan, uh... I actually I need you to save the day in a different way... by... creating a very romantic video montage of me and Sarah for our rehearsal dinner.
- Oh. Hmm.
- Hmm, not quite as Superman as I'd like, but, uh, of course, man, anything you need.
- Thank you so much. Um...
- Just a little problem...
- Sarah doesn't have any old pictures.
- So I was thinking maybe we could just Photoshop her into some of the different places that she's lived, something kind of cute.
- Totally cute. Okay.
- I get it. I got it. I'm on it.
- Done. I'm on it. Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah, of course. My best man.
- Means a lot to me. You know... Yeah.
- Best man. Nah...
- You are the best man. Come on! I am, aren't I.
- Jeffrey, our time has come.
- Need some footage of Sarah, do you?
- Why?
- You don't have any, do you?
- We have over 1, 250 hours of Sarah-related footage.
- My clients have been exploring their options as filmmakers ever since realizing that Jeffster! may not be as... lucrative as expected. No way.
- I've had a camera running for years.
- Jeff: We have voyeur, we have candid, we have nip slips of Chuck.
- Okay, all right, good, great. Listen, all right...
- (groans) Cannot express to you the rage that is actually building up...
- On the other hand...
- I really could use that footage to complete this present for Chuck, so... (clears throat)
- May I have this footage?
- Lester: Grimes, I am a montage... artist.
- I am gonna need first and... final cut. I am fairly certain it'll turn out terrible...
- I can hear you... But I do need the footage. So...
- You may have first cut, then he will hand it over to me, and then I will make it good.
- Yes. Uh, my clients will attach themselves under those terms. Agreed.
- Morgan: Casey!
- Good news.
- Best man chores are off the plate, so I am fully avail for the mission.
- Let's go save Chuck's mom!
- Howitzer.
- All right!
- (imitates b\*ll\*ts firing): Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na, na, na... nah... I don't know.
- I kind of like the ones that make me look big,  you know? You're not coming.
- Can't believe how much you worry.
- Casey, listen to me.
- All the wedding stuff is going to get taken care of.
- Ellie is on it.
- And I need to be here for my team.
- You're not part of any team. I don't see...
- How could you say that?
- I've have been doing a ton of really, like, big-time stuff lately.
- You're not coming, so why don't you just... focus on your twinkle lights.
- My twinkle lights.
- Ouch.
- (explosions booming)
- (indistinct chatter)
- Oh, God.
- Uh...
- (Sarah sighs)
- Lot of chickens and stray dogs, and not a lot of top-secret holding cells.
- Where do we even start looking?
- How many mines have security like that?
- Let's find out what these guards are up to, huh?
- (speaking Spanish)
- Hope you boys are hungry.
- Casey: Looks like there's two entrances to the mine.
- The miners go in one; guards go in the other.
- Bet you Volkoff's down in that one.
- Well, if your mom is still in the area, she's probably being held down there.
- All right. What are we waiting for? Let's do this.
- (speaking Spanish)
- (chuckling)
- Ugh.
- Casey: The guards are leaving.
- We got to move. Yeah, well, we can't just waltz in after them. Look at the traffic going in and out. We might be way outmanned.
- I have an idea. Why don't we leave the table before this thing attacks us?
- Yeah. Agreed.
- Gracias.
- (chuckles)
- (grunting and groaning, loud body blows)
- Move it along, Chewie.
- Chewie?
- Why are you calling him Chewie?
- He didn't even eat anything off that disgusting platter.
- Honey, it's a reference to Star...
- Oh, I love you.
- I got a bad feeling about this.
- Prisoner transfer from Pueblo facility.
- Do you have documentation for that?
- Sarah: It was a verbal.
- So if you just tell us which cell is available, we'll take our man back there.
- I don't know how you ran things in Pueblo, but you're not getting back there without the proper paperwork.
- Casey (whispering): This is what happens when you draw your plans from Star Wars.
- Got to get bloody now.
- Just hang on. Hang on a minute.
- Hang on.
- Chuck: Uh, excuse me, sir.
- Uh, look, I don't mean to... I don't mean to bug you, but can you look at the cute little number that came in with me?
- Not the large man.
- Real pretty one-- blonde.
- Girls like that are pretty few and far between in Pueblo, if you know what I mean.
- The two of us have kind of had this will they/won't they, burgeoning office romance going.
- I'm really trying to impress her, so could you help me out a little bit?
- b\*at your man.
- Sorry?
- Once, I snapped a guy's neck for a girl.
- She melted all over me.
- Chuck: Is that right?
- I can kind of see that.
- Okay. Locking that one away.
- Oh, now. Right now.
- You want me to do that now.
- Okay, yeah. Now would be the appropriate... time.
- (grunts)
- Really?
- Do you want to die alone?
- (Chuck grunts)
- Okay!
- I did that! Wasn't that sexy?
- Uh, so sexy.
- Mm. All right. You two crazy kids take him back to cell 24.
- But, uh, I think this girl's already been to cell 24.
- Oh, she looks like a dirty one.
- (chuckling)
- (laughs)
- Oh, I get it. Yeah, like cell 24. Dirty one.
- (grunts)
- (sighs)
- Hey, that's so sweet. You defended my honor.
- Well, you know, we're getting married in a week, sweetheart.
- Now, let's get rid of this body, huh?
- I'll get rid of it. You go find your mom.
- I'll be right there as soon as I get this guy's pants off.
- Oh, shut up. Move.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Looks like your mom's in cell 13.
- (beeping)
- (computer trilling)
- Mom. Chuck!
- You're about to get married.
- What are you doing here?
- Yes, exactly-- we're about to get married, which is why we're getting you out of here right now.
- Oh, no, honey.
- I'm sorry. I can't leave yet.
- But you should go. I can handle myself.
- No offense, Mary, but that's the attitude that got you captured in the first place.
- Vivian's team has reassembled The Norseman down here.
- I can't leave without it.
- I'll just endure a couple of rounds of torture, and then I'll find a way to break out and get it. - Uh, no.
- We're not leaving you here to get tortured.
- We have a wedding to get you to.
- Casey: Hey, come on, we got to move.
- Let's go. Sweetheart, I know the wedding is important, but so is the nation's safety.
- If I leave now, they will move the w\*apon and we'll never get it.
- Sarah: Mary, don't be stubborn.
- We're just here to extract you, not finish a failed mission.
- Failed? Stubborn?
- Okay, okay, okay. Look, here's the plan-- I'm gonna go with Casey to get The Norseman; Sarah, you're gonna stay with Mom, make sure she doesn't get tortured. I don't need backup.
- Why can't Casey stay here with your mom?
- Hell, no. I'm going with Chuck.
- Okay, great, that's the plan. See you soon.
- I'll be outside.
- (exhales sharply)
- Casey: Interesting choice-- choosing your mom over your fianceé.
- Oh, come on, man, I was just trying to make everyone feel...
- Wait a minute, wait, wait, is that really how it looked?
- Just remember, Bartowski, Sarah's the one you're gonna be sleeping next to at the end of every day.
- She's the one you protect.
- (kicks down door)
- Where's The Norseman?
- Mary: I don't know why Chuck felt it was necessary to come and get me.
- I think Chuck wouldn't have felt it necessary if you had any backup.
- Chuck knows that I can take care of myself.
- Maybe, but now Chuck and the rest of his family are in harm's way two days before his wedding.
- The food here is really ghastly.
- Where's the guard?
- It's been moved, but I don't know where.
- Vivian's planning a meet to sell it to the highest bidder.
- We got to get to that meet. And we got to get out of here before Vivian finds out we know about it and calls it off.
- Come on, let's go before your girls k\*ll each other.
- You don't have to tell me twice.
- Vivian: Everything's still locked down.
- (whispers): Hold your fire.
- They'll never k\*ll me. You don't know that.
- No interruptions, guard.
- (chuckles)
- Riley: Hello again, Frost.
- Chuck: Sarah, the w\*apon's been moved; Vivian's selling it.
- If she turns up, keep her alive so the meet still happens.
- What do you want with me?
- I really just want to see you dead.
- And I've been waiting for my young friend here to be ready to do it.
- Vivian, surely this is one trigger that you'd like to pull yourself.
- Mary: Vivian, I know you won't do this.
- Riley: Do it, Vivian.
- Don't.
- Sarah: Everybody against the wall right now.
- Move it. Now.
- Vivian: Sarah!
- I'm sorry, Frost has somewhere to be.
- Hey.
- Mom, it's time to go.
- Mom?
- The woman who betrayed my father is the mother of the man who's betrayed me? Well, that makes sense.
- Vivian, there is still so much that you don't know and we need to talk about.
- No, I'm done talking to you.
- Casey: Guards could be here any second.
- Come on, we got to move.
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- Vivian: Guards? Guards!
- Okay, well... since we're not on a long plane ride home with my mom now, maybe we should talk about what what happened in the mine.
- Okay. Talk.
- All right, so, first of all, I know I messed up, but I was just trying to get all of us out of there safely.
- I mean, the places was crawling with bad guys.
- I know-- but sometimes it feels like you can protect me from anything... except your mom.
- No, you're right.
- You're right, but I-I can protect you, even from my mom, I promise.
- (phone buzzing)
- Beckman needs us at Castle.
- No need to unpack.
- Beckman: Team, it looks like Vivian Volkoff is indeed planning to auction off The Norseman device in Moscow in 12 hours.
- It's up to you. We must strike now.
- Uh, but can't someone else go?
- I mean, our rehearsal dinner is tomorrow.
- I'm afraid we don't have time to train a new team.
- Oh, and thanks for the invite.
- Oh...
- N-No, um...
- I'm not serious.
- General, Vivian knows all of our faces, so how are we supposed to get in?
- Agent Bartowski, if you don't mind?
- An agent will impersonate one of the buyers.
- They'll outbid all of the others for The Norseman device, and walk out the front door; no bloodshed.
- Okay, except, like Sarah just said, Vivian knows all of our faces.
- So not sure exactly how to avoid the bloodshed.
- Luckily, one of the buyers Vivian invited was just detained by Interpol: Italian arms smuggler Etorre La Barba.
- Remind you of anyone we know? Morgan?
- General, Grimes is not prepared for an operation like this.
- We don't have time to argue. He fits the profile.
- You have your orders. Good luck, Team.
- (computer chimes)
- Etoray La barbah, huh?
- Ciaobella!
- Eh, spaghetti pizza.
- Eh, mamamia!
- It's a-me, Mario.
- I sell-a the arms to-a the bad guys.
- This is a horrible idea.
- Buddy, are you absolutely sure that you feel comfortable doing this?
- Sí, sí, si. Don't a-you worry about-a me, huh?
- I take care of everything. I am-a you Best-a Man!
- Whatever you need-- bada-boom!
- You have to stop that.
- Morgan will be fine.
- Casey, you and I will provide plenty of backup.
- (groans)
- And you two will just stay here and get ready for the wedding.
- Stay here? What? You're taking us off our own mission?
- I-I appreciate you trying to protect us, Mom, I do, but Morgan is my best friend, and we've been on Vivian Volkoff for months.
- In which time she's gone from harmless coed to one of the world's top w\*apon dealers.
- Which is why I had to step in in the first place, to fix your mistake, sweetheart.
- Our mistake? Um...
- I don't mean to be critical, but obviously, you've been very busy getting ready for the wedding, and your minds are elsewhere.
- Yeah, like maybe on the fact that Dad turned an innocent man into Alexei Volkoff.
- Mom, did you know about Agent X?
- Chuck, I could not afford to let the CIA know that I knew about Agent X.
- And neither should you, which is obviously something else we have to clean up.
- We don't have time for this right now. The point is, Chuck and I are going on our mission, you're providing backup, and that's the way it's gonna be.
- I don't think so. I agree with Sarah.
- Thank you.
- That is...
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, guys, I need to borrow the big guy for one second.
- Just best man stuff that just dawned on me.
- I have to...
- Thanks, buddy, it was getting kind of tense in there.
- No problem, but you know the errand you gave me to take care of-- obviously I can't get to it right now, but not a problem.
- Got my top people on it, so not to worry.
- Couldn't we have just watched this at home? I have, like, a million things to do today.
- Captain: Yeah, I love popcorn and massages as much as the next guy, but can we just get this started?
- Moviemaking is a collaborative art, even for an auteur.
- I have many people I'd like to thank-- my rep Big Mike, Jeffrey, my parents-ish, and, uh... my main man upstairs.
- Anything is possible.
- Let's get this puppy started, shall we, Jeffrey?
- (romantic theme plays)
- Heart.
- Pancreas.
- Cockle.
- My cockle.
- (Lester gibbering on video)
- (screeches)
- America.
- Ellie: Stop, stop, stop.
- Please, make it stop, make it stop.
- God. Dude, dude, that is just unholy.
- Thank you. Okay, I am going to need the footage from your clients.
- I'm gonna be taking over from here.
- W-Wait, does that mean Big Mike doesn't get his ten percent?
- We weren't even paying them.
- What?
- Then what was I doing all day?
- How do you guys feel that went?
- Hey, what do you think?
- I finally got the accent down.
- (in bad accent): Don't move or I will k\*ll you whereas you stand and not even your madre will recognize your corpse.
- (spits)
- Yeah.
- If I had my druthers, you'd stay topside selling microwaves.
- That's great, that's great.
- Let's, let's, let's figure this out 'cause I thought we were past all this.
- We're roomies, you've been training me really hard, I've been in danger a ton of times, and not to mention you love the little snack packs I bring on missions.
- So, why suddenly are you being this big jerk to me?
- It's Alex.
- She's worried about you.
- Oh.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, okay, okay, you're telling me you are being a jerk because you care?
- (grunts)
- Yeah.
- Fat load of good it's done me, too.
- I promised Alex I'd keep you safe.
- There are times on every mission when things go sideways.
- That happens, I can't protect you, and I've broken a promise to my daughter.
- I see your dilemma.
- Yeah.
- Everything's gonna be fine, everything will be fine.
- Trust me, nothing will go wrong.
- Why did I just say that?
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, you can wait in the van if you want. No, it's all right.
- I think I'll give Chuck and Sarah a little space on this one.
- It's hard to have kids.
- You can't always protect 'em.
- Yeah, or their idiot boyfriends.
- (chuckles)
- Casey: We're in position.
- Is Grimes ready?
- Chuck: Just a second, Casey.
- I-I don't know if I can do this, uh, guys.
- I've been thinking about it, and, um-- you know, what do I know about being a bad guy?
- Plenty, buddy, plenty.
- Look at that suit-- part Goldfinger, part Drax, right?
- You noticed.
- Come on, seriously, you got nothing to worry about.
- We're going to be with you the whole time on the comms, not to mention the fact that we will be monitoring the video feed through these glasses.
- And Casey will be on the opposite rooftop with a sn\*per r\*fle.
- You know how he likes to sh\*\*t things from far away.
- I do, yeah. (chuckles)
- Chuck: You can do this, Morgan, you can totally be a bad guy.
- Okay, yeah, it's going to be great.
- (exhales)
- (humming "Darth Vader's Theme")
- (Morgan hums along with Chuck)
- (humming intensifies)
- This'd better not take long.
- I already tried to k\*ll three people at this table.
- (in Italian accent): Yes.
- What do you mean?
- No, you heard me the first time.
- sh\*\*t the puppy.
- I am so sick of feeding him.
- k\*ll the puppy.
- Ciao.
- So hard to get good henchmen nowadays, hmm?
- Si, si.
- Thorium signature detected.
- Looks like they're bringing in the Norseman. Casey?
- Vivian: Welcome, gentlemen, I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.
- You're all here for the same reason: a chance to purchase one of the deadliest w\*apon ever created-- the Norseman device.
- By locking onto a target's DNA, it can k\*ll a single person in the middle of a crowd with 100% accuracy.
- Perfecto.
- There's no way to run from it, even on the other side of the world.
- Whoever ends up with it has an enormous advantage, but, truth is... it's an advantage I intend to keep.
- (groans with pain)
- (men groaning in agony)
- Morgan: What do I do, guys?
- Casey: Morgan, Morgan, you have to die, or they're going to k\*ll you. Do it.
- Oh, no!
- Aah!
- (body hits floor)
- Morgan, whatever you do, stay calm.
- Mom, Casey, tell me you got a line on him.
- I got him in my sights.
- If it gets hot, I'll take 'em all out.
- Riley: Don't feel bad, Vivian.
- Every man in this room would have k\*ll you without a second thought.
- That's why we collected their DNA.
- This one-- he k\*ll all the families of his rivals.
- Sick.
- And this one... he gassed an entire village of innocents just to eliminate... one enemy.
- Sicker.
- And this one right here with the beard...
- Stop.
- These are dangerous men-- I get it.
- Riley: Vivian, I'm not trying to turn you into someone you're not.
- I'm trying to turn you into who you need to be.
- And you may still get your chance.
- What do you mean?
- There is a man in this room who isn't actually dead-- someone who has infiltrated our organization by pretending to be someone we invited here today.
- He's merely feigning death.
- Casey: Riley left my scope.
- I do not have Riley.
- Morgan, Morgan, don't move.
- So, friend, are you going to get up?
- The name's Carlisle.
- Sebastian Carlisle.
- Carl to my friends, which you are not.
- I take it you're MI6?
- I've been tracking you since Munich.
- It was actually rather clever.
- You see, first I cr...
- Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
- Next one's yours, promise.
- Casey: Chuck, Sarah, Norseman's on the move.
- You're on it, go.
- Copy that.
- Looks like they're taking it out of the building.
- I'm going to help them secure the w\*apon.
- You stay here and keep Alex's boyfriend safe.
- Roger that.
- w\*apon's leaving the building.
- You ready? Yeah.
- Always wanted to say this-- fasten your seat belt.
- Literally, you should fasten your seat belt right now.
- Oh, okay, sure.
- (whispering): Guys...
- I haven't heard anything in a while.
- Please tell me it's okay to move.
- Casey: Wait, wa-wa-wait.
- Okay, okay, go quick.
- I'll cover you.
- (door opens)
- (stammering)
- Somebody-somebody-somebody's coming, somebody's coming.
- Oh, Casey, they got acid, just like in that really disgusting scene from Breaking Bad.
- I've never seen Breaking Bad.
- You'd love it, it's great. What?
- It's like the perfect counterprogramming to... the curtains. I can't see you. Morgan, shut up! They closed I can't protect you if I can't see the targets.
- Run!
- Okay.
- What the... ? Oh. Who's that?
- Hey. Hey, just one sec...
- Did it!
- Use your glasses.
- Show me the targets with your glasses, Morgan.
- And try not to move.
- (groans)
- (grunts)
- (g\*n, man groans)
- Morgan?
- Morgan, can you hear me? !
- (body hits floor)
- Morgan, can you hear me?
- Morgan!
- Yeah. Yeah.
- (grunts)
- Oh...
- Casey, I think you sh\*t me.
- What about the rest?
- Yeah, they're all dead.
- Casey, that was amazing!
- Oh, Lord, I feel faint.
- Just breathe.
- Get to the elevator.
- I'll meet you outside.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Looks like they're leaving the building.
- (tires squealing)
- (tires squealing)
- (sensor beeps)
- The w\*apon's in the trunk.
- I'm going to get something to open it.
- You all right?
- Don't pretend to care.
- Vivian, I am truly sorry for everything that's happened, but there is so much that you don't know.
- I know enough. I know that you're Agent X.
- No, Vivian, I'm not.
- Agent X... is your father.
- He was an MI6 agent.
- He was going undercover.
- He let the CIA perform an experiment on him-- one that changed him into the man we know now as Alexei Volkoff.
- But before that, he wasn't evil, and neither are you.
- This... This is crazy.
- Don't move.
- Riley, is this true?
- Yes, I'm afraid it is.
- But, first, are you going to tell her who turned her father into Alexei Volkoff, huh?
- It was Stephen J. Bartowski.
- Chuck's father.
- He and Frost manipulated your father to give up his own identity so they could further their CIA careers.
- That's a lie!
- No, it's the truth!
- And I will not have you lie to Vivian anymore.
- No!
- (Sarah gasps)
- Chuck.
- You saved me.
- Always.
- Where's Vivian?
- We have to find her.
- Mary: No.
- We should go.
- You two have somewhere to be.
- Honey, I totally dropped the ball on Chuck's present to Sarah.
- I fell asleep right in the middle of cutting it.
- You did what you could.
- It'll be okay.
- Look. There they are right now.
- Guys, wow!
- The courtyard-- it looks unbelievable.
- I can't believe you did all this for us, Ellie.
- Thank you so much, sis.
- I promised myself that I wasn't gonna cry.
- Mascara!
- (laughing)
- You ready for this?
- Absolutely.
- (camera shutter clicking)
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Man, does Big Mike need this brandy Alexander.
- Had another deal blow up in my face.
- Huh.
- But I do love the game.
- What happened to your arm?
- Wii Tennis.
- Son, it's amazing you're not single. Mm.
- (chuckles)
- Casey.
- How's the Sunshine Band, buddy?
- (chuckles) It's KC and the Sunshine...
- No one's ever used that on you, huh?
- Really?
- Seriously, um, there is one more thing I wanted to talk about. You're right.
- I shouldn't be out there in the field.
- Nah, not if it's making the woman I love worry, so you tell Alex I'm done, I am out.
- Why don't you stand tall and tell her yourself?
- Nah, it's better coming from you, I think.
- No, no, why don't you tell her yourself?
- Okay.
- Hi.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Is he watching? No.
- Should I walk away?

- Mary: Many of you might not know me, but I am Chuck's and Ellie's mom.
- (sighs) Truth be told, I was gone for a long time, and now that I'm back in their lives, I sometimes overcompensate.
- But lucky for me, my soon-to-be daughter-in-law is very forgiving.
- She's never heard me say it, but Sarah is one of the strongest and one of the most amazing women that I have ever met.
- So I would like to propose this toast to her.
- Sarah, thank you for taking care of my Chuck.
- May you have many more adventures together, and may you always keep each other safe.
- All: Oh.
- (clinking) Thank you.

- Love you.

- To make you feel pain, the way I feel right now.
- I've lost everyone important to me, and I have you and your family to thank for it.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. We can talk about this.
- Or how about you look around the room at all your family and friends, and ask yourself, which one am I going to take from you?
- You see, I still have another Norseman device.
- Ple-Please, please.

- Okay, you don't do things like this.
