# Chuck Versus the Muuurder

- Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know.
- I'm putting together a new team, and I want you to lead them.
- So this was your idea? Use my father's program to make your own Intersects?
- Vicki, no! Don't sh\*\*t!
- (beeping) Chuck, are you about to disarm a nuclear b\*mb using fruit juice?
- Agent Bartowski, you will oversee all aspects of the Intersect project from here on out.
- Mrs. Woodcomb? Yes?
- I believe that I have something of yours.
- Ellie: Great news.
- I found my dad's computer.
- (typing)
- Wow, Dad.
- (computer beeps)
- Still at it, babe?
- Yeah.
- Did you get Clara down?
- Um...
- Hon? What?
- ELLIE (laughing): Oh, my God.
- I'm so sleep deprived, I...
- I'm not tired, although I feel...
- I feel totally awake, you know?
- You're in the zone. How's it going?
- My dad's work is so amazing. I've never seen such creative experimentation in neuroplasticity before.
- His mind is... incredible.
- That's probably where Clara gets it.
- She said "arthroscopic" yesterday.
- Honey, if Clara can say "arthroscopic" she needs to stop pooping her pants.
- You sure you should be digging around on your dad's computer?
- I mean, like you said, what if it's... dangerous?
- Well, I don't know.
- But I've never seen anything like this before, Devon.
- I think that he was working on getting the neural circuitry in the brain to reorganize itself. It's...
- It's fascinating.
- Don't worry, honey.
- What's the worst that could happen?
- Beckman: Good morning, team.
- As you know, today begins the agency's new agenda: find Intersect candidates who are as similar to Agent Bartowski as possible.
- Thank you for joining us, Director.
- The Intersect clearly works better in Chuck than in anyone Director Bentley was able to find.
- Ouch. So sorry.
- Beckman: This time our search will be led by the only man who really knows what it's like to be an Intersect.
- Chuck, we need you to find more Chucks.
- Well, it's going to be tough, you know... broke the mold, etcetera.
- Beckman: Just a reminder... you are all to provide support to Agent Bartowski in any way he requires.
- Chuck, you're in charge.
- Thank you, General.
- (computer screen beeps)
- Morgan: In charge. Well, man, I'm-I'm-I'm moved, here.
- I'm so proud of you. Well, thanks. I-I appreciate the sentiment, Morgan. But it's really not that big a deal.
- Although it does seem like it's been four years in the making.
- Glad it hasn't gone to your head. I'm just saying, I may have saved the city by disarming a nuclear b\*mb using a juice box... Yes, you did.
- But, be careful, 'cause remember last time you were in charge, you led our party of D and D adventurers to their fiery deaths.
- (Chuck laughs, clears his throat)
- We've been over this, Morgan, okay?
- If Tom had cast the spell of confusion, then we would have been out of that situation...
- (mutters) Well anyway... that's neither here nor there!
- But I do want to address the elephant in the room, which is, you know, "reporting to me, " which can be a little weird or awkward for some of you...
- (groans)
- But I think you're all very important.
- I hope you enjoy this.
- I'll be back in charge as soon as you and your... stupid pocket protector screw it up.
- Um, excuse me.
- Pocket protectors are not only very practical, they are required Buy More attire, lady.
- Okay! Well, using my own personality as a guide, I've created an extensive psychological profile.
- Langley culled their database for matches and sent me four spies that are perfect candidates.
- They're going to be here in an hour.
- Good Lord. Four more Chucks.
- All right. First up is Lewis.
- Tech-ops specialist.
- Star hacker by the age of 14.
- His Warcraft Guild took down Deathwing, World First.
- No. Yes.
- And the coolest part...
- (British accent): Good afternoon.
- Chuck: He spent some time in England.
- (British accent): So he has a delightful English accent.
- (growls) CHUCK (normal voice): Josie.
- Psy-ops genius.
- A real feeler and emoter, with a scary sense of intuition, which makes her great in the interrogation room.
- Casey: I get it.
- You had to get a girl to find someone as feely as you.
- (screaming)
- Bogie. Get down!
- N- n-no. No, no, no.
- Not a bogie, guys. Not a bogie.
- This is Damian.
- Former Navy Seal. Marksman award.
- But because of his appearance, he's been typecast by the Agency.
- Spent the last ten years embedded in and he's really sick of the desert.
- Which kind of reminded me of... when I was stuck in the Buy More.
- I think he could really shine in an opportunity like this.
- And last, but the opposite of least...
- Wow.
- Chuck: Brody. The Brodster.
- Nerdy. Emotional.
- Into his family and friends.
- Disarmingly attractive.
- Dear God, there's another one.
- Okay. Let's get to work, huh?
- Chuck: Casey, you'll be handling physical testing.
- Chuck: Sarah, you'll handle psychological evaluations.
- So. You're in the field and you have a conflict with your partner.
- What do you do? You want me to say that I'd talk about it right away.
- But what I'd really do is manipulate my partner into doing what I want.
- Chuck: And Morgan... you're in charge of evaluating the candidates' cultural knowledge.
- Quick: Rush's best album.
- Ah!
- Caress of Steel.
- (imitates a buzzer) No. Next! if everyone can just be civil.
- Charlton Heston sci-fi question for you.
- What's cooler: Soylent Green or Omega Man?
- Trick question: POTA.
- Wow.
- (grunts)
- Hwah! Hwah! Hwah! Hwah!
- (thud)
- (grunts, thud)
- (groans)
- Can somebody bring Lewis an icepack?
- Morgan: Favorite Bond: Connery excluded.
- I have no opinion about any of this.
- Why do men care so much about these things?
- Nothing you're asking me matters at all.
- What on earth is she talking about?
- I'd talk about it, right away, for as long as it takes.
- Nothing should ever wait or be left unsaid.
- Sometimes it's best to say things two or three times, even.
- Most important graphic novelist: Grant Morrison or Moore/Gibbons?
- Kind of a Brian Vaughn man, myself.
- Chuck: Actually...
- I've always secretly felt that way.
- So, time to pick a new Intersect.
- You ready, Chuck?
- (Casey grunts)
- (clears throat) Yes.
- Yes. I'm ready.
- I was, uh, I was honestly feeling... kind of nervous earlier.
- But I went upstairs, got a little fresh air, and now I am ready.
- I just feel bad for the others, though, you know? I mean...
- We've really started to become friends through all this.
- I'm the "cool boss. " Yes, you are incredibly cool.
- Now, who are you going to choose?
- Well, what's your vote?
- I mean, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I don't value your opinion.
- My opinion is, you're going to screw it up.
- What is the diff...
- Man, she hates me.
- Well, you did steal her job.
- You're her nemesis.
- I hate being a nemesis.
- Maybe I should take her out to coffee.
- Casey: Bentley's no joke.
- You should stop trying to befriend her and watch your back.
- The only thing that's going to make her look worse than this whole Greta debacle is you succeeding where she and I couldn't.
- Now... who's the new Intersect?
- (ringtone plays)
- Brody: Nice!
- (rattling) What are you doing?
- (gasps)
- (tires screeching)
- ♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪
♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪
♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪
♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪
♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪
♪ Na-na na-na na-na ♪
- (whimpers)
- Wow, really? Is it big BM day?
- That's the best kind of day there is.
- Now hand me some of them flyers, and let's sell some TVs.
- I'm-I'm sorry, Big Mike.
- Why are you wearing the big B. M. ?
- I thought that we retired it.
- It's for the new LED flat-screen TV sale.
- The Large Mart has the same promotion going on today.
- Those bastards!
- They don't respect us.
- I mean, the last five promotions that we've had, Large Mart has had the same ones!
- If we don't do something special they are going to hand us our head in a handbasket, just like always.
- I don't know if that's... quite the expression.
- But, l-l-let me tell you something.
- You do not have to sell yourself like this.
- Say what?
- Other men wear collared shirts all day, while I get to wear a... a great big B. M. on my chest!
- That's job satisfaction.
- If you say so.
- You know, son, as leader of the Buy More, you set the tone.
- Look, I know you got a lot going on here.
- But remember, the Buy More is a special place.
- It can be fun here!
- Okay. Okay. You're right.
- You know what?
- Let's have some fun, huh?
- All right. That a boy. (laughs)
- (car tires screech)
- Hey! Hey! No!
- Aah... Hey!
- Hey! (shouts indistinctly)
- (tires screech)
- (panting)
- Hey, gang.
- Say, uh, has anyone seen Brody?
- No.
- No.
- Haven't seen him.
- Huh. All right.
- Josie: Well, I guess Chuck has made his choice. Nobody ever picks me.
- (cell phone vibrates)
- Hey, Devon, what's up?
- I think I have some bad news.
- Ellie's been working on your dad's computer.
- What? !
- That was supposed to be under lock and key. How did she get it back?
- She said some woman brought it over.
- Told her that the Buy More tech dudes gave it to her by mistake. No, no, no, no, no.
- Chuck, I would have told you sooner, but I didn't think she'd find anything.
- But Chuck, she's making progress.
- Okay, look, it is very important... imperative even... that we stop that work immediately.
- You should see how happy she's been.
- I think the work is making her feel close to your dad again.
- Listen, I'm stuck here for a little bit.
- So I need you to take care of this right away.
- Just replace the computer's hard drive with a blank one when Ellie's not looking.
- She'll think it just broke again.
- And-and I'll take care of the rest.
- Bye.
- Director Bentley? Director Bentley, I need to ask you, did you give the Orion computer to my sister Ellie? No.
- Well, I don't mean to offend, but I don't believe you.
- You shouldn't.
- I gave it to her.
- I knew it! I knew it, I knew it.
- Okay, maybe you were unaware that I feel very strongly about keeping my sister away from the CIA, but now that you know that, I hope that you respect it, because I'm in charge.
- The problem is, I don't respect you.
- Hey, hey, you can resent me all you want... whether you like it or not, this is my project for a reason.
- I'm going to tell Brody he's the new Intersect.
- A choice I feel very confident... (grunts)
- What the... ?
- It's bl\*od.
- Ew.
- And there's so much of it.
- It's coming from over there.
- (gasping)
- Well, there goes your first choice.
- Dear Lord!
- There's been a m\*rder!
- So, Large Mart claims that this kidnapping is in retaliation.
- See, I know no one here would break a two-year prank detente with the Large Mart because, I as your leader, have forbid it.
- Why? Because it's just that important.
- But there you have it.
- They claim we kidnapped Kevin Bacon.
- What did you two do?
- Oh, you put Kevin Bacon in a closet?
- Really?
- Listen, we had to.
- Otherwise, they would have dominated us just like always, right? (all agreeing)
- 'Cause weirdly, an adorable little pig attracts more customers than a large man wearing a big yellow and green B. M.
- Call me crazy.
- (grunts)
- Ah.
- All: Ah. Sweet.
- I'm buying whatever he's selling.
- (grunts)
- I can't believe he's dead.
- How could this happen on my watch to my top recruit? Who would do this?
- Well, nobody's been in Castle for a week besides us, Bentley and the recruits.
- That means the k\*ll is still among us.
- That's it, all of them.
- Uh-uh.
- (with British accent): And the one in your skivvies, mate.
- It's like D and D all over again.
- Okay, you are still in charge.
- You need to be calm and confident.
- But just remember, we need to figure this out, okay?
- Right.
- Calm... confident.
- Okay.
- Okay, here's the situation, people.
- Castle is officially in lockdown.
- Which means all cell phone use is blocked.
- We will be going over all of the surveillance footage and interrogating each and every one of you.
- Now, Casey, Sarah, a little sidebar.
- Looks like some of us are above suspicion.
- Yes. Why do they get to keep their w\*apon?
- Yeah, who the hell are they?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, enough of that.
- Casey here has been a part of Team Bartowski proudly, for years now, and has saved my life countless times.
- Oh, I get it now.
- You're the Intersect's brainless heavy.
- Colonel Casey would never k\*ll anyone... who didn't deserve it.
- What about her?
- Uh, I think I can safely say that my fiancee here would never k\*ll anyone... who didn't deserve it.
- Your fiancee, huh?
- Now I see it. What is that supposed to mean?
- Wait, ba-ba-ba-ba, okay, okay.
- You go back over there. You go back over there.
- You come over here.
- As I was saying, it is not Casey, nor is it Sarah.
- So therefore, the k\*ll must be one of you.
- Right. Let's blame the swarthy, bearded guy.
- No, no.
- Lewis: I have lots of friends who are t\*rrorists.
- This is just what my face looks like!
- I didn't spend the last ten years in a cave for my country to have to deal with this.
- I'm totally out of here.
- Oh, and by the way, I'm Greek.
- Greek? I wouldn't have guessed that.
- Damian, wait!
- Don't sh\*\*t anyone, Casey.
- Damian, wait.
- Wait.
- Damian, halt. Please halt.
- No, just, no! Please, just... I'm leaving now.
- Damian...
- (beeping)
- Damian, no!
- Just get me out h here.
- 'He's losing a lot of bl\*od.
- I need a doctor!
- I'm grabbing some bandages.
- Let's just put some pressure on the wou. .
- (groans)
- Sarah, everything is off-line.
- We can't access the surveillance videos anymore, and all communication channels with CIA are dark.
- Good job getting the emergency lights back up.
- The b\*mb was linked to the three others.
- The main power grid is out.
- Since the doors were already on lockdown, we're in here without any support. We're trapped?
- This is not going well.
- Listen to me, Chuck, the most important thing about leadership is to convince everybody that you have everything under control.
- What if instead Casey was in charge, yeah?
- Or maybe you could be in charge. It doesn't work like that.
- I had my sh\*t.
- Almost nuked the Inland Empire.
- These people have been following you for a week.
- Chuck, look, you're not in charge by accident.
- You did disarm a nuclear b\*mb containing fruit juice.
- Okay, you can do this.
- We're right behind you.
- Thanks.
- Okay, so... so here's the thing.
- We are officially checked in, now, with a k\*ll, but not to worry... I have everything under control.
- (yells) (electrical crackling)
- I feel calm.
- Bloody hell, we're sitting here disarmed and the meat head has all the g\*n.
- Casey, listen, you need to swallow this, okay? What's most important now is to support Chuck. He needs to look like the boss. Fine.
- I still don't trust an American operative with a British accent.
- Well, it's not my fault.
- It's from my semester abroad.
- Wait, one semester? You got an accent from four months in England?
- Yeah, that's really annoying, dude.
- Well, it's not that bad.
- Morgan: First off, I'd like to thank all of the Large Mart representatives for coming.
- Sincerely, I cannot apologize enough...
- Just give us Kevin Bacon, and peace can be restored.
- Fine. Fine.
- I would like proof of life.
- See, you have a certain human being of ours, and, uh, I'd like to speak with him.
- (sighs)
- You won't be able to track the signal, so don't bother.
- Morgan: Big Mike? Hello, son.
- Thank God.
- Big Mike, it's so good to hear your voice.
- I was sick. I can't go a whole day without my number two.
- How are you doing? I'm fine.
- Whatever you do, don't give in to Large Mart's demands.
- Of course I'm going to give in to their demands.
- I got to get you out of there, okay?
- Do you want me just to call the police?
- Uh, the police have no jurisdiction here.
- This isn't anything that can't be handled within the confines of the shopping center.
- And anyway, I'm having a nice time.
- They brought in Subway flat bread breakfast sandwiches.
- The steak, egg and cheese ones? With chipotle southwest sauce.
- It reminds me of your mama.
- Muy caliente. I've heard enough.
- He has heard enough.
- Okay, Marvin, here we are.
- Take your pig and...
- This some kind of joke?
- Where is Kevin Bacon?
- I don't... I don't know.
- Okay, Marvin, you have my word.
- I will get to the bottom of this.
- But you need to give me till midnight, and I will find your pig.
- Yeah, well, if you don't, I can't promise your friend's safety.
- But I can promise you this... a big flaming B. M. on your doorstep.
- Devon, I had a breakthrough.
- What's going on?
- Well, I had an epiphany between baby yoga and music.
- I was trying to figure out how my dad's research added up, and then I thought about Clara, and about how she's learning stuff so fast.
- My dad was trying to figure out a way to input knowledge into the human brain without having to learn it.
- Wow. Yeah.
- I mean, think about the implications, Devon.
- He left that knowledge for me for a reason, and I... and I figured it out, but why?
- I just... I don't know what he wanted me to do with it.
- I just wish... I wish he was here.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- We do.
- Chuck: So, Director, the way I see it, you've got more motive than anyone.
- You hate that I'm in charge.
- You want my program to fail.
- And you've said very mean things to me all day.
- I would never do anything like this.
- Oh, wouldn't you?
- I mean, you've already gone after my sister, so clearly you are willing to do anything to benefit your own project.
- Including m\*rder.
- And you're the only one who knew that Brody was my first choice. Brody made you light up like a 13-year-old girl.
- Everyone knew he was your first choice.
- What? Really?
- I don't know what else you want me to say.
- I didn't do it!
- I'm not buying this whole weepy thing. It doesn't fit your profile.
- You're not the only one who's trained in psy-ops, you know.
- You've been hiding something from us all week and you've been highly emotional.
- For your information, I'm emotional because I got dumped last week by my boyfriend for being... too emotional! (sobbing)
- (whispers): Look, I don't do too well with girls and crying.
- You know what I mean?
- Maybe we should be a little easier on her.
- She's trained to do this, Chuck.
- Do not let her manipulate you.
- (sobbing continues)
- Okay, fine, I won't, I won't.
- (groans) This is torture!
- You're torturing me!
- No, we're not! No, we're not torturing you!
- There's no torture going on in here!
- Although there is no clear definition.
- (quietly): Sarah...
- Look, we're gonna get you some more k\*ll very soon.
- But first, you're gonna answer a few more questions, okay?
- For example, why is your bag covered in sand, huh?
- Which happens to be a great way to throw off our X-ray equipment. Mighty convenient.
- Or it's because everything I have is covered in sand!
- Because the CIA won't send me anywhere where there isn't any sand!
- (groans)
- Old school. I like it.
- It doesn't even work... because there's sand in it.
- (groans)
- Lewis, my tech guy... and suspiciously, an elite b\*mb specialist.
- You knew I had high hopes for you.
- Maybe that was your motivation.
- I mean, you knew that Brody was my first choice and that you were my second.
- No, I didn't know that, but thanks for not choosing me.
- You didn't, you didn't know that?
- Oh, looky what we have here!
- Sharp! Can you explain this?
- Uh, it's my kn\*fe.
- Yes, but why do you have a kn\*fe used by an IRA b\*mb maker in your bag?
- Because I k\*ll an IRA b\*mb maker and I took it from him.
- Casey: Walker, Bartowski, you figure out who the k\*ll is yet?
- No luck. It could be any one of them.
- All we know is that whoever the k\*ll is, they were sitting in that chair.
- I'm not even sure that we know that much.
- (device trills) Actually, Sarah, I'm pretty certain, as there is a b\*mb strapped to the bottom of the chair.
- We gotta go right now!
- Did you feel that?
- I haven't felt anything for years.
- (Chuck coughs)
- Chuck: What's happening?
- My ears are ringing! I can't hear anything!
- Are you okay?
- (coughing)
- (g\*n hammer cocks)
- Walker, glad you're still alive.
- Yeah, I'm good, too. Thanks, buddy.
- (Sarah coughs)
- Damian caught another piece of shrapnel, this time in the back.
- Oh, my God, we gotta get him to a doctor!
- We will.
- Unless we die here.
- Then he'll have to wait.
- Everyone's here except Lewis.
- Sarah: Yeah, of course, the b\*mb expert.
- He must have set up the b\*mb so he could get away, which means...
- Lewis is the k\*ll.
- Seriously?
- He was my second choice.
- This is not just Car BM we're talking about here.
- This is our Big Mike.
- He's in real danger here, fellas. Real danger.
- Think about it: what if these men were to take away his sandwiches, hmm?
- He is not built for that.
- So I have to ask you one more time, okay: Where is Kevin Bacon?
- I don't know what to say, my friend. It's a... it's a mystery.
- It's an unsolvable mystery.
- It is not a mystery! In fact, it is quite obvious what has happened.
- You stole Kevin Bacon, and therefore you two hid him, hmm?
- Or... did we?
- Okay, Damian's unconscious, but he's still alive, for now.
- (electrical whirring)
- Look, the good news is we can trust each other again.
- Lewis is clearly the one who planted the b\*mb and k\*ll Brody, who probably caught him in the process.
- Brody!
- (gasps)
- We're gonna need all hands on deck.
- Lewis is in Castle with nowhere to go.
- That guy can build a b\*mb out of anything.
- Watch for trip wires, booby-traps.
- Yeah, also remember it's important that we capture this guy alive.
- Okay? We need to find out who he's working for.
- Why he would have sabotaged Castle.
- You just gonna stand around and talk about it, leader?
- No, I'm gonna find Lewis and I'm gonna take that bastard down.
- (g\*n cock)
- Listen, Director, I just wanted to apologize for accusing you of m\*rder.
- And if you promise to stay away from my sister, I think we can get past it.
- Maybe even become friends.
- Do you know what your problem is?
- You want people to like you too much.
- A good leader shouldn't care about that.
- Sector Two clear.
- You don't understand, six years we were together.
- I mean, how did you get the Intersect to commit?
- Sector One clear.
- Chuck: Clearly, you feel that way, as you haven't made even the slightest of attempts to be liked.
- Bentley: That's not important to me.
- Really? Not even a little bit? What, are you made of stone?
- Shh! Did you hear that?
- (thudding steps)
- Guys, I hear movement in the ducts.
- (thudding continues)
- Yeah, I hear it too, Chuck. It's Lewis.
- Crap. I lost him.
- Casey, you got anything?
- (clattering)
- (quietly): I'm right underneath him.
- Freeze, Limey, if you want to keep your balls.
- What the hell?
- What is it?
- It's a pig.
- (grunts)
- (Casey grunts)
- Sarah: A pig?
- You hid Kevin Bacon in the air ducts?
- If you love something, let it go.
- If it comes back, you can eat it.
- He lives by a strange philosophy of karma and diet.
- It combines the two.
- But it works for him.
- A pig? Did he really just say... ?
- That means Lewis is still out there.
- And all I've got is you. Whoa! Where you going?
- I'm going to the Intersect room.
- It's b\*mb and it's the safest place in Castle.
- Don't you... ?
- Director, stop! I command you!
- Hey, hey! I don't wanna pull rank here, but you can't just walk away from me like that.
- Ooh, you don't want to pull rank 'cause I may not like you?
- Chuck: What is that?
- That is none of your concern.
- It is absolutely my concern.
- It's my father's research. It's government property!
- It's my sister using the computer... ! It's a matter of national security!
- National security? ! You're putting my family in danger!
- I am protecting my country and saving my project from you!
- Do you see him?
- I see him.
- Mm-hmm.
- We got you, Lewis.
- There's nowhere left to go.
- (hydraulic whirring)
- I think we can safely say that Lewis is not the k\*ll.
- Brilliant deduction, Sherlock.
- It was bad. I mean I've seen bad, but this was grizzly.
- That means the k\*ll's still out there.
- Leaves just the ladies. Figures.
- All right, let's finish this.
- It's not me, so that leaves you.
- My sentiments exactly.
- All right, everybody shut up and put your w\*apon down.
- Unless it's one of them.
- Whoa-whoa-whoa! Drop your g\*n.
- You drop your g\*n! I want this to be over!
- This is a mess. Okay, leader, whatcha got?
- Who's the k\*ll?
- There's been a m\*rder!
- I know who did it.
- What?
- At first, I thought Brody's k\*ll had to be Lewis, since it made sense that my second choice would want to k\*ll my first choice.
- So I'm not your first or second choice. That's good to know.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, look, look, I loved all of you guys.
- Really. It's just that there can only be one number one and one number two, but they're both dead now.
- And if it makes you feel any better, I did suspect you of being the k\*ll for a little while, mainly because of your...
- volatile emotional state.
- (gasps) Sorry.
- But you're not a m\*rder.
- While going through your things, I found the pregnancy stick.
- You're expecting.
- Congratulations. I hope you're blessed with a boy.
- So, which brings me to where my suspicions have been pointing the entire time.
- You must be joking.
- Only one person was unaccounted for during Brody's and Lewis's m\*rder...
- My opinion is you're going to screw it up.
- ... and who has unique access to Castle's infrastructure.
- (whirring)
- I'd be very careful.
- (whispers): I know it isn't you.
- Casey: What?
- She had ample opportunity to k\*ll me, and she didn't take it, okay?
- I just wanted everyone on this side of the room so I could quietly tell you: it's Damien.
- He's the k\*ll, and he's probably armed.
- Let's do it.
- I'll flank him on the left.
- I got your right.
- I got your back, Chuck.
- Damien: How about we go with Plan "B", Chuck?
- You're going to let me out of here.
- You're going to get me to a doctor, or... I'm going to blow us all up.
- The boombox? Really?
- I- I guess actually I should've expected that.
- Look, be rational, okay? You want to get out of here just as much as we do.
- How do you know what I want?
- I wasn't even one of your choices.
- 'Cause you don't want to die.
- You've wanted out of here all along.
- Brody caught you planting the expl\*sives in Castle.
- What are you doing?
- Chuck: That's why you k\*ll him, and had to cover your tracks.
- (groans)
- But when we locked this place down, you knew it was only a matter of time before we knew that you were the k\*ll.
- And that's when you really committed.
- By blowing yourself up.
- Chuck: Knowing where the expl\*sives were placed, you used the door to shield yourself from the blast.
- Bold move.
- I had no choice.
- But the b\*mb locked all the doors.
- So you tried a new method.
- Thinking that if we had a k\*ll in mind, we'd get you out. So, you planted a b\*mb under your chair, during your interrogation.
- Ah! This is torture!
- You're torturing me!
- When the b\*mb went off, you used the chaos as cover to k\*ll and hide Lewis.
- But unfortunately for you, we found him.
- So now we know what happened, but we don't know why.
- Who are you working for, Damian?
- What are they after?
- I came here for you, Chuck.
- Now, you're going to get me out of here.
- Bentley: Chuck...
- You know what you have to do.
- We can't let you leave.
- You know that.
- So just put the b\*mb down.
- No, thanks.
- It's your choice, boss.
- (g\*n)
- (groans)
- Sarah, the b\*mb's been activated.
- It's okay, Chuck, you can do this.
- I can, normally, yes, but not this fast. There are so many security measures, I just can't defuse it in that amount of time.
- Chuck, keep everybody as far away from the Intersect room as possible. No, Bentley!
- Bentley!
- Chuck: What are you doing?
- The Intersect room is the only room that can contain this blast.
- The power's out, the doors won't shut!
- There's a manual release.
- No. No, no, no, no, there's got to be another way.
- (g\*n hammer cocks)
- This is what a leader does.
- Hey.
- I hotwired the control panel, using my stupid pocket protector, thank you very much.
- Okay, come on. We don't have time.
- (beeping)
- (squealing)
- Oh! (squeals)
- (grunts)
- Congratulations on solving the m\*rder mystery and for saving Castle from destruction.
- And a special commendation to you, Chuck.
- You were a true leader.
- Thank you, General.
- But I'm only as strong as the team that surrounds me, and, as always, Sarah and Casey were my eyes, ears, and more today.
- I'm glad you feel that way, because this is the team we're sticking with.
- Following the security breach, it has been deemed too dangerous to put the Intersect into a new recruit.
- At least for the foreseeable future, Chuck, you are to remain the only Intersect.
- Director Bentley, you will await reassignment in Washington.
- General, if I could just add something quickly.
- Director Bentley was invaluable today.
- Noted.
- Well done, team.
- So this is it, huh?
- You're a good spy, Chuck Bartowski.
- I'm sorry for underestimating you.
- Thank you.
- It's good to not have a nemesis anymore.
- You know... your sister is incredibly smart.
- If anybody can figure out the Intersect, it's her.
- You might want to reconsider keeping her away from her path.
- We are not going to let Big Mike just sit there and rot.
- Employees: No! Who knows what those Large Mart heathens could be doing to him? So I'll tell you what we're going to do.
- We're going to break him out.
- Employees: Yeah!
- Morgan: Let's do this.
- Look! He's alive!
- It was easy, they had a couple of nerds watching me.
- My shift was over.
- I ain't staying late!
- (employees laugh)
- I'm glad you're okay.
- Lester: Yeah, we're all glad.
- We're all glad you're okay.
- (banging on door)
- (hollering)
- Large Mart rules!
- Our B. M.
- Big Mike: It's okay, son.
- It was worth it to have some Large Mart fun again.
- We can make another B. M.
- Hey. Is this a Large Mart pig?
- Yeah, of course it is.
- (pig grunting) Oh, hey.
- Chuck: Let me guess.
- Jeff and Lester stole the porcine v\*ctim, Large Mart snatched Big Mike in retaliation, he was able to liberate himself, but they still torched the big B. M. on your doorstep.
- You, you left out, uh... nothing, no, that's right, that's exactly right. I figured as much.
- Yeah, pretty much. What happened to you?
- It's been a long day.
- Yeah. To say the least, yeah.
- I'll just leave it at that. Here you go, here's Kevin Bacon. (oinking)
- Oh, come on, buddy. Come on... Oh, hey.
- He also ate a lot, so... just...
- Oh! No, no, that's good, I could kinda...
- Oh, God...
- Oh, no... No!
- Hey.
- Hey.
- So I took care of things on my end.
- Ellie won't be bothered again.
- How's everything going here?
- It's done.
- The computer's taken care of?
- Kaput.
- (clears throat) It's for the best.
- Right?
- Totally. Yeah.
- So... we're still not telling Chuck, right?
- No. We don't want him to worry.
- Well, guys...
- I want to apologize for all the grief you had to swallow to support me.
- Chuck, that's not necessary.
- I think it is, though. I... I do.
- I would've fallen apart today if it weren't for the two of you.
- It's not just the computer, or the man.
- The Intersect is all of us.
- It's the three of us, working together.
- That's why it works.
- Don't ever forget that.
- (computer beeps)
- Beckman: Good. You're all here.
- I wanted to get in touch with you right away.
- We've interrogated Damian, and he wasn't trying to obtain the Intersect.
- He was simply hired to b\*mb Castle.
- Have we figured out who he was working for?
- It turns out Damian was wired $10 million by none other than Vivian Volkoff.
- It appears she's going after the man who took down her father.
- Wait! Wait, wait, Vivian Volkoff is trying to k\*ll me?
- Your team will be contacted should any more information surface. For now, remain on high alert.
- I'm someone's nemesis?
- For real, this time.
