# Chuck Versus the Cubic Z

- Chuck: I'm Chuck. Here's a couple things you might need to know, or forgot.
- We spared no expense re-creating the Buy More.
- It's now a full-fledged CIA-NSA substation.
- New Buy More rules.
- Slides, trapdoors and the new superspy/Nerd Herder, Greta?
- Be still, my heart.
- I think you have earned this. The keys to the Buy More.
- I'm making you store manager, Mr. Grimes.
- Chuck: Maybe Awesome's right.
- Marriage, baby...
- Who knows? Maybe we're next.
- Man: When's food? I'm hungry.
- Shut it, convict.
- You're talking my ear off.
- [ENGINE SPUTTERING]
- We can get 10 miles, max, but no way we'll make Yucca Mountain.
- We're being redirected. New top-secret facility.
- We're going where?
- MORGAN [OVER PA]: Attention. Your patience is appreciated.
- Release of "Spy Attack" is less than two hours away.
- Somebody restack these DVD players. And I need a lot more blank CDs.
- No. Get these consoles out of there. Guys, I need a lane going through here.
- All right? I vlogged about listening k*ll last night.
- Did anybody watch? No.
- And it shows.
- I don't think you're taking this seriously.
- Oh, I'm serious. I'm De Niro serious.
- Listen, the Buy More is CIA... and as the manager, I am the front line.
- Things don't run smoothly, it's a security issue.
- I need a sidearm. A Desert Eagle or something big.
- You're beyond De Niro. This is Russell Crowe serious.
- Okay, listen. Biggest game of the year drops tonight.
- Fans have been camped out for a week.
- A week without consoles and simulated k*ll.
- You can cut their bloodlust with a kn*fe.
- Weren't you camped out last year?
- Yeah. But that means I know what they're thinking.
- And they expect a full-blown, hi-tech launch presentation.
- All right, look, with just me at the helm... this is it, dude, my managerial Bushido test.
- And I'm ready. I want it. And I don't need any help.
- But if something was to go down, there is a CIA presence, John Casey.
- Oh, and the new Greta.
- The new Greta?
- Hello, Greta.
- We're all set for the game launch.
- Perfect.
- Any further tasks?
- Uh...
- Filter. Filter.
- Nope. Nope. Carry on. Well done.
- Lovely to meet you.
- [WHISPERS] Yes.
- [WHISPERS] What?
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] Where was I? I'm the manager.
- Manager, national security. All that. Yada yada.
- As much as I wish I could stay and see how this plays out... I have to catch a flight.
- Uh, you don't say?
- Private jet to Monaco.
- Wow.
- Good for you. A whole week chasing some lazy oligarch... down the French Riviera with your stunning girlfriend.
- Did I mention that too?
- It's gonna be the mission...
- Of a lifetime. I think you mentioned that as well.
- But hold on one second here.
- What is with the unbridled enthusiasm? Where's the Chuck relationship neurosis?
- Where's the handwringing and the mishegas?
- Well, I'd never speak for Sarah, but if forced to... l'd say that she's finally starting to settle down with me.
- Wow.
- Let's pause. Be very still. You are in a happy relationship... l'm peaking professionally. Let's savor it.
- [SIGHS]
- Smells like victory.
- [GRUNTING]
- [PANTING]
- What's eating you, Walker?
- Fighting like a pit bull, huh?
- Has it changed anything... finding out you had a kid?
- What?
- They say priorities change.
- Priorities are the same: God, country, duty, Corps.
- [GRUNTING]
- All right. Yeah. Sometimes I think about calling... but Alex has her own life.
- I still don't know what my role is. What's with the interrogation?
- Chuck let something slip last night about the future.
- [GRUNTS]
- Oh, yeah? What?
- Kids? With you?
- Huh. Bartowski's the king of cool, huh?
- [GRUNTING]
- I'm a spy.
- I can't even process the idea of having kids.
- I need to say something to him before he runs away with the idea.
- Probably already measuring for drapes.
- We're going on this trip to Monaco. He's gonna know something's wrong.
- He's gonna keep digging at you too, till you give it up... then spend the rest of the trip moping.
- [MONITOR BEEPS]
- [GRUNTING]
- Harness your fury, Agent Walker.
- Your mission to Monaco with Agent Bartowski has been canceled.
- Oh. Oh.
- Subtle.
- Beckman: A prisoner transport... headed to our Yucca Mountain supermax was redirected to Castle.
- The prisoners are ours... until the transport is repaired or a chopper frees up.
- Whoa, wait, wait, wait, what? Canceled? Monaco canceled?
- It was supposed to be the mission...
- Of a lifetime. I know.
- But there is a silver lining.
- We get to stay in and have a quiet night and, um... And chat.
- I don't know if I'd call that lining silver... as much as copper or zinc or manganese.
- We were supposed to be in St. -Tropez... as Lord and Lady Carmichael, all expenses...
- Unless there's something we needed to talk about.
- Lock and load, Chuck.
- Lock and...
- Sarah, hang on. This chat.
- [g*n COCKS]
- I mean, are we talking about like a chit-chat... or, you know, an FDR fireside chat?
- Everything is fine. I just thought a night in might be nice.
- A night in at the Buy More.
- Well, there's nothing I love more than a night together with you.
- [ALARM BUZZES]
- Gentlemen.
- Sir.
- Carmichael.
- Aah!
- Guard: Back off him!
- Hugo: Yeah.
- [IN STRAINED VOICE] Yeah. Nice, quiet evening.
- At least it can't get any worse.
- Heather: Well, well. Jenny Burton.
- My old high school punching bag.
- Love your dungeon. Can't wait to catch up.
- [PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
- Morgan: Guys, 40 minutes to the game launch.
- Time to move some units.
- Now, in the meantime, please, do me a favor, fix this.
- You know, shower, shave, toothpaste, hair gel, anything.
- Okay? Just try not to embarrass me.
- Ha.
- You talk like you got a lot of brass in your pants.
- For a dead man.
- He's here.
- Who?
- Lester: The man whose job you stole.
- Big Mike.
- Oopsies.
- Ugh.
- Move.
- I knew this day would come.
- I avoided my mother's house so I didn't have to see him.
- But I can handle this.
- I can handle anything.
- I am a cobra.
- Son, I'm bursting.
- With pride, seeing you in that suit.
- I never wanted anyone else to wear it.
- But if it's family, it's okay by me.
- So, Mr. Panzer. Hugo.
- You on a new diet? New workout?
- Regimen?
- You're looking pretty fit.
- Heather: Can I just... ?
- No.
- Just one thing.
- Not interested.
- Well, you're acting awful bitchy, Burton.
- Or whatever it is you go by.
- Sarah Walker.
- And don't forget it.
- [DOOR BEEPS]
- Guard: All set.
- You done with that newspaper?
- Look who thinks he can read.
- Chuck: Sudoku fan, huh?
- Go ahead.
- Well, enjoy your new accommodations.
- [DOOR BEEPS]
- Mike: There's no room in my heart for anger.
- Love, though? I'm full up.
- I spent the past few months out on the sea... hunted with my bow, looking for my...
- My inner Big Mike, my happiness.
- I discovered the source of it.
- Good.
- Your mama.
- Ha, ha.
- And I wanna do right by her.
- I want to make her an honest woman.
- Let's stop talking. All right?
- It was good seeing you. I'm really glad you came by.
- And, you know, we'll... What is that?
- Mike: That's a full half-karat... pear-cut cubic zirconium.
- I came by here to ask your permission... to marry Bologna Garcia Bougainvillea Grimes.
- Oh, wow.
- Think on it. Give it back to me when you think I'm worthy of your mother's love.
- Keep it on your person. I don't trust the scoundrels working the store.
- Nor should you.
- But on that note, actually, I should probably get back to work.
- You and me both. Ha, ha. Know what I mean?
- I intend to support your mama as best I can.
- But, man to man, I'm between gigs.
- Hear there's a game launch.
- You can always use an extra hand there.
- Especially when it's a close relative asking?
- [PHONE RINGING]
- Yeah, I... It's...
- I won't let you down, son... Ah!
- Boss.
- Hey, ha, ha. All right.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Grimes. Manager. Speak.
- Mm-hm.
- What? What do you mean we're only getting six copies of "Spy Attack"?
- I got 300 customers waiting for this ga...
- Yes, I'll hold.
- So chat time?
- Sure.
- Here?
- Yeah, okay.
- Look, it's not a big deal.
- I mean, well, it is.
- Maybe.
- It is a big deal? Sarah, what is?
- I love you, Chuck, that's the first thing.
- I love being with you.
- Ditto, right back at you.
- It's just, um... Can we please... just for a second... ?
- Did you just flash?
- Heather Chandler is in the Intersect 2. 0.
- She was connected to Frost.
- I think she knows my mom.
- I have to talk to her now. Transport will be here soon.
- You want Beckman to know we're looking for your mom?
- We don't have the authority to interrogate Chandler.
- We don't have the authority to use the closet... for what it is we use it for, but we do it anyway.
- She knows my mom.
- Fine, but you can't just whip questions out... to somebody like Heather Chandler. It's not gonna work.
- This needs to be a real interrogation.
- Good Cop, Bad Cop.
- How about Tough Cop, Silent Cop?
- Okey-dokey. Which one am I? Right.
- Right, got it. Oh, hey, uh, real quick, though.
- Time machine. In case things go south... use "time machine" in a sentence. That'll be code to back off and regroup.
- Just remember, Tough Cop, Silent Cop.
- Of course.
- [DOOR BEEPS]
- We need information on an arms deal you were involved in... with Alexei Volkoff, and an agent whose code name is Frost.
- And coming my way is?
- Optimal placement at Yucca Mountain and favorable parole review.
- How about a unicorn too?
- I'm as likely to get that as the crap you just offered up.
- Sarcasm is the lowest form...
- Sorry.
- Heather: You wanna offer me something?
- Witness protection.
- For that, I'll spew on Volkoff and Frosty the Snow Bitch.
- But we both know that's handled by WitSec, who I'd be happy to talk with.
- Not some man-boy and a bottle blond with a daddy complex.
- You got a lot of nerve, talking to her like that.
- Burton can handle a little ribbing from a pal.
- You're her partner, Chuck, not her boyfriend.
- Wait.
- You two are actually together?
- Us? We? No.
- We're not.
- Oh, get out.
- You kids are an item. He's not just your partner.
- Isn't spy sex great?
- Heather, we were discussing...
- Heather: So how deep are you? Shacking up?
- Doing the dog thing first or straight to babies?
- One? Five?
- Time machine.
- Time machine? Really?
- Right... ? Okay.
- When I said use it in a sentence, I was thinking more along the lines of: "You wanna relive your past? Then get a time machine. "
- We need to take this slow.
- Sorry I lost it in there.
- If you let her get under your skin... about living together and the other thing she mentioned... we're not gonna get anywhere.
- What other thing?
- Remember, tough, silent. Do not let her get under your skin.
- She's not. She won't... What? Hey.
- Are you okay?
- Guard: Food, Panzer.
- [GUARD GRUNTING]
- We can contact WitSec.
- When did you start dating for reals?
- But first we need a good-faith offering.
- You know why she won't talk about this, Chuck? It makes her edgy.
- I get it. You met my so-called husband/con v*ctim, right?
- I toyed with normal life... played happy homemaker a while.
- And as soon as he got serious, I robbed him blind.
- My advice? Pull the ripcord before you get fried.
- Only thing getting pulled is a rope...
- Look at my time machine. Appointment.
- [CROWD CHATTERING]
- Morgan: I'm gonna handle this.
- I can handle multiple stressors at once.
- Angry mob? Of course.
- A lifetime of calling Big Mike "Dad"? No.
- I really do not like that woman.
- Yeah, that's clear.
- What's not is why this topic of you and me is such a hot button.
- Uh, we have a problem.
- Is that what you wanted to chat about?
- I thought we were en fuego.
- No, we have a serious problem.
- [SHOUTING]
- If he's trying to escape, why doesn't he run?
- This might be about me.
- I kicked his ass on a plane once.
- Hey, Chandler, Mr. Volkoff says hello.
- You send her out, no one else dies.
- Don't open that door.
- What is this about Volkoff?
- I got a transfer to Yucca Mountain, out of the blue.
- In the transport, that monster is in the cage.
- Volkoff engineered the transfer?
- He's capable of it.
- Why would he want to? What did you do?
- Nothing. He's being petty.
- I blew a half-a-billion-dollar deal.
- The F-22 plans were for him. I guess he's mad.
- Come on, Casey. Pick up.
- Morgan: Come on, Casey. Real fast, you know?
- Just inform the anxious horde... the distributor made an error and there's a delay in delivery.
- [PHONE RINGING]
- Two weeks.
- Sounds like a job for the manager.
- No games.
- Casey.
- A prisoner has escaped in Castle... and we're trapped in Cell 6.
- On my way.
- [RINGS]
- Colonel, I know I'm supposed to be upstairs.
- Doc Bollywood was staring down my shirt... and those losers in line are freaking me out.
- Casey: Yeah. Just get to the cell block, neutralize the prisoner.
- [GRUNTING]
- Casey: Greta. Greta, what's happening?
- She's indisposed.
- Chuck: Uh... Uh...
- Panzer's on the computer now. I can't see what he's doing.
- Buying patio umbrellas. He's trying to get to us, you dope.
- Boy, you're a charmer.
- [ALARM WAILING]
- You're gonna have to override the Castle lockdown. Can't get in.
- I didn't put the system into lockdown. I just locked the door to Cell 6.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Panzer locked us in? This is not good, people, okay?
- I've been locked in with this guy before. I handled it fine, but he got very agitated.
- Uh, he's using the mainframe to open each cell door.
- There's a fire override. I'm gonna have to access it. Hold on.
- Come on, come on.
- Door 2 is open.
- Computer: Hello, Colonel Casey.
- Welcome to the new Castle override mainframe.
- How can I help?
- You're kidding.
- Computer: I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?
- And Door 3.
- Location of fire emergency override.
- Computer: Did you say, "Hire nursery overhige"?
- Why would I? It's not even a real word.
- Computer: I'm sorry, I didn't get that.
- [DOOR OPENS]
- Chuck: Door 5.
- [g*n COCKS]
- Fire emergency override. Where is it? Or you die.
- Computer: The fire emergency override is behind my monitor.
- Just press control, escape.
- I didn't get that.
- Thank you, Casey.
- Okay, let's go. Move out.
- You go first, scare the rats.
- You go, so I can keep an eye on you.
- Sarah, you, me, go, now. Come on.
- Jeff: We're totally screwed.
- No. No. This is a positive, okay? Today, we get to be challenged.
- I'm gonna make a phone call and get us the games we were promised.
- Now, you will handle the launch presentation.
- At midnight, we settle the crowd, you will read from the script.
- And you'll read from the script slowly.
- You don't just drop a role in a man's lap and say, "Go, seal, clap for your fish. "
- I must make this my own... if I am to undertake it.
- Whatever.
- No big deal. I can handle this. I can handle multiple stressors.
- Ugh.
- What monkey flung this? No.
- Chuck: You know, I was thinking... about how some of my favorite movies wind up in air ducts.
- Like Aliens and Die Hard.
- Although, generally, it doesn't wind up well for the duct-crawlers.
- Thanks for that, movie dork.
- I bet you have, like, a Tron poster.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Keep crawling, sister.
- [LAUGHS]
- [ALARM WAILING]
- Walker, where are you?
- We're just passing Coupling Duct 5A.
- [WHISPERS] Come on, come on, come on.
- Ten feet, turn left, into the junction room.
- Heading there to unlock it.
- Any sign of Panzer?
- Not in Castle. But he's after you... so watch your back.
- That's fantastic.
- You hear that, Chuck? Stay alert. Don't distract yourself staring at my tail.
- Looking at your... ? No, no, thank you, no.
- I'm kidding. Jenny-Sarah, how did you end up with such a goofball?
- Masculine goofball, thank you very much.
- Oh, you're sweet. I did the sweet-guy thing too.
- I know how it is.
- Mm.
- Sorry, foot slipped.
- Whoo, touchy. I must be hitting home.
- Of course I am.
- Sarah: We're almost at the junction room.
- Crowd: Three, two, one, zero!
- Man: Yeah!
- Nice and orderly.
- You are in for the night of your lives.
- Ugh.
- Don't get your hopes up. There's not enough games.
- Don't say that. Everything's fine. Everything is great. Go get your...
- Listen, stretch it out just a bit longer. We are almost out of the woods.
- Easy, sister. We've got this covered.
- Okay.
- We've got this covered.
- [PHONE RINGS]
- Talk to me here. Oh, yes. Here we go.
- Jerry, what's going on? What did you score me?
- How many you got? What do you got? How many games? Yeah. Yeah.
- Two! Two games. That's... I... That's not enough, Jerry.
- I got to have more games, brother. Hello? Jerry? Jerry? Oh.
- [PHONE BEEPS]
- Son, your crowd is surly... and you got no product.
- I don't wanna tell you how to do your business, but the sheep need a shepherd.
- Yeah. They sure do. Sheep, huh? Those sweet little sheep.
- [CHATTERING]
- [GRUNTING]
- Okay. Casey's gonna have to unlock this for us.
- Till then...
- I'll finish what I was saying.
- Running your mouth isn't gonna get you witness protection.
- You were never gonna call Witness Protection, so let's just call this payback.
- Chuck: What do you mean, "payback"?
- I got hitched to a dork just like you.
- Sweet, dumb... loyal, a mutt. And that was attractive.
- I thought, "This schmuck is gonna make me a better person. "
- And for 10 minutes, I convinced myself I didn't mind movie night or dinner at 6.
- Then my true nature kicked in.
- And the reason this conversation has Burton so upset... is because it's doing the same for her.
- We're the same.
- Not gonna dignify this.
- Right. Yeah. Because we are professionals.
- We cannot hear a word you are saying.
- She's all spy.
- White weddings, rug rats in a minivan? It's not in our wiring.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Heather, guess what. You talk too much.
- Burton, be kind to him. He's too sick in love to see the truth.
- Just remember, she keeps secrets for a living.
- Why are we saving your life again?
- Because of my connection with Frost. And my time with her in Burma.
- Casey?
- Heather: I'm right and she can't face it.
- That's why she's upset.
- She's not upset, Heather. I know what she looks like when she's upset.
- And it's more...
- Sarah: Look out! Oh!
- [GRUNTING]
- [YELLING]
- Chuck: Let go of me!
- Hugo: Unh!
- Help me.
- Sorry, kitten. You're on your own.
- You know you'd do the same.
- Hugo: You're coming down with me.
- Sarah: Unh!
- [GRUNTING]
- No, no, no. Not the tie, not the tie.
- [GRUNTING]
- Hugo: Unh! Come here.
- Chuck: Uh!
- Chuck: Sarah!
- Hugo: Unh!
- Chuck: Sarah, help me!
- Hugo: Come on, you coward.
- Chuck: Sarah! Unh!
- Carmichael!
- [GRUNTING]
- Aah! Sarah, help me!
- Sarah: Chuck! Come on.
- Up. Up.
- [PANTING]
- That felt good.
- You know... they wanted me to read you this trash.
- But you deserve better. We, as a people, deserve better.
- Crowd: Yeah!
- So... brace yourselves for a free-form, no-holds-barred poetry slam.
- [CROWD GROANS]
- And a kung fu demonstration of moves in the game "Spy Attack. "
- Can we just buy the dumb game?
- Crowd: Yeah!
- No... you cannot.
- [CROWD GROANS]
- Sarah: How far down did he go?
- Could you see the bottom of the duct?
- Chuck: It was too dark.
- And I was kind of concentrating on his fists flying at me.
- Heather: You're a real tough guy, Chuck.
- Chuck: Hey, this morning... I was going to Monte Carlo.
- But instead, I spent the night as a canned good.
- It's funny the way life can suck.
- [g*n COCKS]
- Move and you die, tunnel rat.
- All right, I got him.
- Transport on the roof in two minutes.
- About Frost, last chance to deal.
- Heather: You're just a dog with a bone.
- No dice.
- Good luck. I'm rooting for you.
- But I'm certainly not betting on you.
- Shut it.
- You're not letting Heather get to you, are you?
- No, of course not. I'm all good.
- I know your all-goods, and that was not a real all-good.
- It was a fake all-good.
- I'm just curious why what she said got under your skin like that.
- Well, once we get rid of these guys, we will have our chat.
- Ah.
- What are you smiling at?
- This doesn't smell right.
- They're not CIA. They're Volkoff's men.
- Down. Down, down, down!
- Volkoff must have intercepted our transport.
- [GRUNTS]
- Chuck, we'll handle the g*n.
- Go after the prisoner.
- Ooh!
- [g*n]
- Go for the exit. I got you covered.
- Agh!
- Casey!
- [GROANING]
- I'm all right. Unh!
- Your man's wounded, pinned down.
- Give us Chandler and you'll both live.
- Hand me over.
- Save your ass.
- We both know what you're gonna do, so just do it.
- You kept me alive for information, but it's not worth dying over.
- I know you, Walker. I know what you're going to do.
- You don't know who I am, what I want, or the thoughts in my head.
- We have nothing in common.
- On the count of three, two, one.
- [GRUNTS]
- Oof!
- That was my last b*llet.
- [SIGHS]
- The flea-ridden masses infest my house Do I cry? Perchance to die?
- No, McFly This game launch will not be televised Enough. Just give us the game.
- Man: Yeah.
- We want the game!
- ALL [CHANTING]: We want the game! We want the game!
- We want the game! We want the game! We want the game!
- Jeff: Guys!
- Guys!
- The games didn't show.
- Man: What?
- Shut up... and let the poetry slam you.
- Thank you.
- [ALL SHOUTING]
- Freeze, Panzer.
- Look awful shaky with that sh**t, boy.
- How's your aim in tight quarters?
- Perfect.
- Because that's the gas line.
- Hit that instead of me, this whole building goes.
- So it is. But that doesn't matter, because you're trapped.
- [CREAKING]
- I don't think these air ducts were meant to hold 400 pounds.
- And since most of that is you, I need you to back up now.
- You're losing them, son. They're going to rampage.
- Right. Right. Hey! Hey! No!
- No! Halt! Halt!
- Halt! Everybody just go... Whoa!
- [ALL SCREAMING INDISTINCTLY]
- Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, Morgan. Morgan!
- Back up.
- You back up.
- You back up.
- [SHOUTING]
- [BOTH GRUNTING]
- The engagement ring!
- No, no, no.
- Ah.
- [GRUNTING]
- Look, this is a call to arms.
- I brought my black case for such an occasion.
- It's in my car. Go get it for me.
- I don't work for you.
- Hey.
- I do work for you.
- Ha, ha.
- [LAUGHS]
- Get on your feet, son.
- No, I can't... I can't... The, uh...
- There's a riot going on.
- Right. Right. I need to tell you.
- Your ring, it fell out of my pocket.
- I looked everywhere. I can't find it. I screwed up. I need your help.
- You find the ring, I'll take care of the riot.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
- Yeah!
- Excuse me, fools!
- [SHOUTS] I said, excuse me, fools!
- [GRUNTING]
- [IN STRAINED VOICE] That's not fair.
- What is this madness?
- Yes... we promised something we couldn't deliver.
- Yes, had we delivered, you would have been overcharged.
- Is that any reason to behave like this?
- You got to ditch your lives... and spend a full week with your dorky friends... talking video games... which no sane person would have ever done with you.
- And because we came up a little short on supply... there's a riot?
- Hell, no.
- This ain't no video game.
- It's not.
- This is real life.
- Lester: It's the truth of life.
- Mike: This violence ends... now.
- Not later.
- Peacefully.
- With peace.
- Quietly.
- With a whisper.
- All civil-like.
- Lester: Like you're civilians.
- Hugo: Move it. Move it. Get out of the way.
- Excuse me, son.
- Move.
- Mike: You best stop.
- Or I will come down there and make an example of you.
- Try and stop me, fat man.
- What? Who's this... ?
- Give me the Disco Stick.
- That boy is family.
- What the... ?
- Mike: And my name... is Mike.
- [SHOUTING]
- [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]
- [CROWD GASPS]
- [GROANS]
- Big Mike.
- Mr. Big Mike.
- All right?
- Well done.
- Another Purple Heart, Casey.
- Unh.
- I'm fine.
- Gonna be laid up for a while.
- Paid vacation.
- Ugh.
- Can't stand the silence.
- Well, maybe you could use the time to meet up with Alex.
- Figure out what your role is in her life.
- Hmm.
- You should do the same for Bartowski.
- So we can get back to normal around here, hmm?
- Whatever that means.
- Operation Beacon.
- That's where I met Frost.
- What's Beacon?
- It was an underground arms pipeline, but I lit out before it was active.
- Frost was always around Volkoff.
- Doing what exactly? What does that mean?
- I couldn't get the full gist of their relationship, but she was there.
- Maybe she had to be.
- That's all I know.
- Sarah: Hugo's ready to roll.
- Chuck: Let's go.
- Thank you.
- Maybe you're right. Maybe we aren't alike at all.
- Maybe you are capable of love, affection and vulnerability.
- I hope so.
- Chuck seems like a really nice guy.
- And he's really in love.
- Are you?
- Goodbye, Heather.
- I looked everywhere, Big Mike.
- I couldn't find your ring. But I did find this.
- Don't give me this because you think I'm upset.
- The assistant manager's vest is a sacred vestment.
- No, I know. Believe me. But you're the best.
- You can handle anything.
- I would be proud to have you as assistant manager.
- Although I understand if you couldn't.
- You haven't quite forgiven me yet.
- I want you to know I'm sorry about the ring.
- Marriage isn't about a ring.
- It's a lifelong commitment of compassion and understanding... especially for your spouse's idiot relations.
- All is forgiven.
- Here. This is yours.
- And, for what it's worth, you have my permission... to marry my mom.
- Son.
- Unh...
- So Beacon.
- That's, uh, a place to start.
- Bringing us to the long-delayed... and much-anticipated chat.
- The other night, when you repeated what Awesome said... about us being next having kids... it scared me.
- Okay.
- And I wanted to tell you earlier... but, um, I didn't. And I've been thinking about it all day long.
- And Heather kept poking the topic with a needle.
- You're nothing like her.
- For a long time, I was exactly like her.
- It took a night in the guts of the building... to realize I'm not anymore.
- At all.
- And I don't wanna be.
- But I do need to take things slow.
- I'm not ready for parenthood either.
- One day, hopefully.
- But not now. Not yet, anyway.
- Who are we kidding? I'm barely on solid food myself, so...
- [CHUCKLES]
- Okay.
- So, slow.
- Super slow. Really slow.
- Let's start small.
- You tell me ready or not ready.
- Okay.
- We're on a trip, one of us forgets our toothbrush.
- Do we share?
- I am ready to share your toothbrush.
- Oh, oh, using the bathroom, door open or shut?
- Door shut. Always.
- Preferably with the sink running or the radio on.
- Sarah: Yes.
- Chuck: Yeah.
- Uh...
- Oh! Whoa!
- Whoa! Uh...
- Wow.
- Wow, wow.
- Uh... Ahem.
- Oh.
