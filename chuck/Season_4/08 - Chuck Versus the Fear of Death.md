# Chuck Versus the Fear of Death

- Chuck: I'm Chuck. Here are a few things you might need to know.
- I'm not gonna fight you on this anymore. If you trust her, that's enough for me.
- Mary: Your father never wanted you to see this.
- See what?
- Flash, come on.
- My mom did something to me with that device.
- You mom gave us a way out.
- Chuck: Sarah, I can't flash. The Intersect is gone.
- We're in a real mess, Agent Bartowski.
- Your trust in Agent Frost proved a colossal error.
- Chuck: I know I screwed up, general.
- If she weren't my mom, I would have shown much better judgment.
- Beckman: Which is why you haven't been ejected from the agency.
- But Agent Frost is extremely dangerous.
- She and Alexei Volkoff are now top priorities for capture.
- Agent Walker, Interpol reported a sighting of them in Istanbul.
- Move out immediately.
- What about me?
- Beckman: Until the Intersect is working... you're Chuck's shadow, in Burbank.
- [GROWLS]
- Uh, general? I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, but are you saying that the Intersect can, in fact, be fixed?
- Our scientists think your mother used a suppression device.
- There could be countermeasures.
- So it's only been suppressed. It's not gone, like "gone" gone?
- I'm not a scientist, Chuck.
- But you're about to meet a lot. You can ask them.
- This is pretty snug.
- The Intersect is an implanted collection of memories.
- A suppression device hides those memories... under what you might call a psychological rock.
- We need to find that rock and remove it.
- Here we go.
- [CHUCKLES]
- Ooh.
- [LAUGHING]
- [BEEPING]
- What was the point of the water? I was just wondering.
- Mm-mm.
- [SCREAMS]
- [CHUCK GROANING]
- All right.
- And that's day 31.
- Great session, fellas.
- [THUDS]
- [SIGHS]
- The file you requested, Mr. Bartowski.
- Thanks, Greta.
- Is it strange that all of the new employees have been named Greta?
- Strange? What's strange about it?
- Doesn't seem strange to me at all.
- Who cares?
- As long as they're spicy.
- That's strange that you don't find that strange.
- But speaking of strange. You've been giving off some real sad sack vibes lately.
- Bit of a whiny wuss, if you ask me.
- Do you ever wonder if this is all life is gonna be?
- You know, Buy More? Burbank? Are the best years behind us?
- Whoa, whoa.
- Wow.
- That sounds like candor.
- Yeah, no.
- Yes. No. Yeah, no. I mean, I can handle candor.
- I'm an emotional man. But candor from you?
- No-ski, Bartowski. No interest.
- You knew that.
- I must be worse off than I thought.
- I don't know why.
- My life would be a never-ending Cialis commercial if I had her.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You look gorgeous.
- How was, uh?
- Russia this time?
- I wish I had good news.
- There's no sign of your mom or Volkoff anywhere.
- What about his headquarters?
- Boarded up.
- For the last month, every trail has gone cold.
- They're underground. Any luck with... ?
- Tests?
- You'd have heard.
- And by that I mean you'd have heard my giant sigh of relief, even in Moscow.
- Ha, ha.
- You'll get it back soon enough.
- When? What's the timeline?
- I'm hoping very soon.
- Because I haven't been on a mission in a month.
- I wake up with my trigger finger twitching.
- It's itchy. Literally, it itches.
- Um, all the scientists who were checking me out, they hit a wall.
- But they're sending a specialist in. Should be here any minute.
- Better be good.
- Casey... nobody wants to put the team back together on missions more than me.
- [GRUNTS]
- He's not being fair.
- Hey.
- Don't let anybody pressure you.
- Hey, hey, no pressure, buddy, but, uh, Casey is a disaster.
- Morgan.
- No, I'm worried about the guy, okay?
- I was talking to Alex. He went over to move furniture.
- He stood there, staring at her fish t\*nk, muttering about an itchy trigger finger.
- I need the Intersect back. I get it.
- He gets it.
- Okay.
- Look, the specialist is probably here right now, so wish me luck.
- Really, really, really good luck.
- Hello?
- [NINJA GRUNTS]
- [GRUNTS]
- [GRUNTS]
- [GROANS]
- Stop! Oh!
- Whoa, ho, ho. Whoo!
- Amazing work, Agent Carmichael.
- You've got the stones of a bull.
- Thanks. And who might you be?
- Agent Rye. Jim.
- CIA psyops division, Langley. Forgive the dramatic introduction... but I need to know what kind of man I was working with.
- And you, taking on three ninjas without the Intersect?
- Lmpressive.
- Thanks. Ha.
- You're, uh, different than the other scientists.
- I don't believe the psychological rock can be hoisted off the Intersect... by watching kittens play with yarn.
- Huh.
- My method is physical... psychological, painful... brutal.
- Brutal? Can't wait to get started.
- Chuck, if you're serious about restoring the Intersect... then I promise you, at the end of this process you will be a spy again.
- Now what do you say?
- You with me?
- Let's get physical.
- Visualize for me the rock sitting on the Intersect.
- Done. It's, uh, granite, I guess.
- Ooh. With specks of marble. The kind of...
- Talk to me about size. Is it large, small?
- Large-y small? I don't know, it's... Ow.
- What was that for?
- We're starting with pain therapy.
- That was the required dose to lift a small psychological rock.
- Great, great. Got it.
- Small psychological rock. Okay, good. Got it. Ow.
- Why?
- That was the shock for a medium.
- I need to know what I'm dealing with.
- Oh, so if it's a boulder... are you gonna hit him with a t\*nk?
- I have to do this.
- We are digging deep into my mind.
- It looks like he's hitting you.
- Agent Walker, how long has it been since you've done kempo karate?
- Not since spy candidate school.
- Naihanchi one!
- Unh.
- Naihanchi two! Bear kata.
- Unh.
- [YELLS]
- Old man kata. Hyah, hyah.
- [GRUNTING]
- Well executed.
- And you smell delightfully of grapefruit.
- Once we determine the proper method of treatment... be it fear, pain, anxiety... this will happen with the Intersect, like her memory of kempo.
- We just have to find the right stimulus to reactivate.
- Agent Walker, no more interruptions.
- Yes. Thank you for coming in today. Next time, buy something.
- [LAUGHING]
- That's all I'm...
- Dude, dude, listen to me.
- That new Greta just disappeared into thin air.
- I've seen her do that before.
- Mm-hm.
- I thought it was in my head.
- No.
- She also has a tail.
- That is in your head. But this disappearing... isn't that highly suspicious?
- I'll answer for you. Yes, beautiful Lester, it is.
- [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
- Follow moi.
- Black forest ham on honey oat with chipotle sauce... banana peppers and jalape√±os?
- See?
- No Buy More employee is that sophisticated.
- [SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]
- Sarah: Oh.
- God, you got b\*at to a pulp.
- Yeah, well, neuroscience hurts.
- You know, I don't know about Agent Rye's method.
- He seems a little unorthodox.
- Well, yes, granted. No question about that. But he's doing his best.
- And I'm willing to endure pain if it means getting the Intersect back.
- Chuck, your physical and mental health are important too.
- Ah, ah, ah.
- Why are my earlobes sore?
- Okay, I think I know how to fix this.
- Oh. Ahem.
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.
- I should get b\*at up more often.
- Chuck, this, um, treatment, the experiments... promise me you're not doing it for me or us.
- No. No, I'm doing it for the team.
- No, I just...
- I've never been a spy without the Intersect. And I quite like being a spy.
- [SIGHS]
- Doing great things, doing them with you. I want that back.
- You don't need the Intersect to do great things. You're great on your own.
- [SIGHS]
- But am I a spy?
- Yes. Yes, but you're Chuck Bartowski... and you do that all on your own.
- Massage oil should be warm. I'll be right back.
- [GROANS]
- [SIGHS]
- I think we should start with some top half.
- Aah!
- Honey, we have company.
- Rye: What happened? Did you flash?
- What the hell is going on?
- What the hell is going on?
- Did you flash?
- Yes or no?
- What are you doing in our bedroom?
- Since our pain experiments failed, your fault, not mine... I think the key to restarting the Intersect is fear.
- What are you doing in our home?
- The castle's a safety zone. And apparently this place is too.
- Chuck feels protected by you. We need to up the ante, again.
- PFOD.
- P-F?
- Pfod?
- Pure fear of death.
- We need uncut, pure, adrenalized fear... rocketing through your plasma right now.
- This was close, but, hey, that could be the cure.
- Holy... ! Ha-ha.
- Boy, you scared me half to death. L...
- Two civilian employees have been watching me.
- I'm getting annoyed by this.
- I have a way of dealing with annoying things.
- It's pleasant. But only for me.
- Oh, I see.
- And, uh, could you tell me which two civilians... might, uh, that be?
- Why'd I even bother? Of course, I will keep an eye on them.
- Okay.
- Go home. Go home.
- You go home.
- Get out of here.
- This way.
- Chuck can't go on a mission without Intersect. That's insane.
- As well as being an expert psyops operative and neurological Ph. D... Agent Rye is a fully trained field operative.
- If he thinks the Intersect will be restored on a mission, he's going.
- And a mission just hit our radar, Agent Rye. I think it fits your bill.
- Is it dangerous?
- Beckman: Incredibly.
- Chance of violence?
- Guaranteed.
- Great.
- This is not great. This is crazy.
- Agent Walker, this is what Chuck wants.
- Right, Chuck?
- Whatever it takes to get the Intersect back.
- Beckman: Chuck and Agent Rye will be going to a chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland... for the auction of a 100-carat diamond... the Cane Volto.
- Our intelligence indicates leaders of criminal and t\*rror1st organizations... plan to attend the auction.
- This stone is more than it seems.
- Method for money laundering, payment for illegal w\*apon.
- Yeah, we've done this before.
- Thanks.
- Ooh.
- Chuck, your job is to win the auction and bring the stone back to the U. S.
- A room full of underworld k\*ll. Sounds great, right?
- Casey and I will be there as a backup?
- No.
- No. With them in Gstaad, Chuck will never reach maximum fear.
- Walker, you and Casey will monitor the mission from Castle.
- What?
- Chuck is going alone with Agent Rye?
- I'll be able to flash if there's no safety net.
- Yes, Chuck, but then there's no safety net.
- We got a plane to catch. Let's move out.
- Wish me luck?
- Chuck, don't.
- Don't be a hero.
- Just come home safe to me, okay?
- Quite a tableau.
- Sometimes the scenery makes me cry.
- Isn't it amazing being a spy?
- I wish Sarah was here.
- Not in, uh, an official capacity, of course.
- The only way in or out of the chalet is the gondola.
- Things go south, we're trapped.
- You'll produce enough adrenalized fear to lift a car, let alone restart the Intersect.
- [SIGHS]
- He's a big boy, Walker.
- Yeah, Chuck's never been on a mission without the Intersect.
- Tell me, honestly, if things go wrong, do you think that he can handle himself?
- I don't know. But I know he'll try.
- Which is exactly what worries me.
- I'm just gonna just check in again.
- For the sixth time.
- [PHONE RINGS]
- Sarah: Chuck, are you there yet?
- Yeah, we're here.
- Sarah, Switzerland is amazing.
- Other than the fact that this place is populated... with a crowd of international psychopaths... the air is so fresh, and the chocolate, so milky.
- Uh, Chuck, listen, listen. If you get cornered and you still can't flash... just don't do anything crazy.
- Don't worry. Everything's gonna be just fine. I'll talk to you soon, okay?
- Hey, are you sure I don't need a disguise?
- Hmm.
- Someone could recognize you as CIA and come after you with a kn\*fe.
- Ha, ha. That would be great.
- Auctioneer: Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll take your seats, we will begin the auction.
- Thank you.
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- The seller, Aldebert De Smet.
- Better known as the Belgian.
- Chuck: Oh.
- I bet I know how he likes his waffles.
- Belgian. Yes, yes.
- I love your humor. So disarming.
- Oh.
- De Smet is known for industrial espionage not precious gems... which is another reason this auction seems odd... aside from the crowd.
- We've got underworld players from Russia, Serbia, Montenegro.
- Wow, you really know your Euro baddies, don't you?
- Focus. When you win the bidding, your competition is not gonna be happy.
- If you're lucky, they'll follow you and try and k\*ll you.
- Fingers crossed.
- Good luck.
- No, wait.
- You're going? I'm alone on this?
- It's your best chance to flash.
- Okay.
- The Cane Volto diamond.
- Very rare, 100 carats... D colored, internally flawless.
- Bidding starts at 25 million Swiss francs.
- Do I see 30 million? Thirty million.
- Do I see 40?
- Forty. Do I see 50?
- Sir, you're already the high bidder.
- Do I see? Fifty.
- Sixty?
- Sixty million Swiss francs?
- MAN [IN RUSSIAN ACCENT]: Bid again, get b\*llet in back.
- Auctioneer: Holding at 50 million? Fifty million going once?
- Nice try, Rye, but I'm not falling for it.
- Going twice.
- Sixty million Swiss francs.
- I'm not afraid of your phony Russian accent or your finger g\*n, okay?
- Man: Bid again and die.
- Do I hear 65?
- Ooh, let's get crazy. Eighty million Swiss francs.
- Auctioneer: Eighty million to bidder number three.
- Oh, I didn't die. What a shocker.
- Stop fooling around, okay? We got a job to do.
- Do not bid.
- Auctioneer: Eighty then, going once...
- One hundred million Swiss francs.
- Auctioneer: One hundred million, ladies and gentleman.
- Going once... twice... sold.
- Man: You can go.
- I blew it.
- You absolutely blew it. And no flash, huh?
- Have you had this chocolate?
- Yes, it's so milky.
- So good. Thought that Russian would get your bl\*od pumping.
- I thought it was you.
- The Russian? It was such a horrible accent. It sounded so phony.
- What kind of a spy am I? I can't even be scared properly.
- But listen, I had a thought.
- Who carries around a hundred million Swiss francs on them? Nobody.
- The diamond is gonna be here until the money is transferred.
- Until then, we can get a better look at the thing.
- You're good, Chuck. Genius minds think alike.
- But I say we do more than just look at it.
- Let's steal it.
- You all know of this new Greta.
- She's beautiful, yes. And efficient, sure.
- But why all the suspicious behavior?
- We're forming a fact-finding mob and we want you, my friends, involved.
- We are calling it Operation Get-A-Greta.
- The objective is to root out why such a nefarious individual... is working here at the Buy More.
- Oh, crap. They're onto Greta.
- What do we do?
- Tell Greta. She'll handle it.
- Right, she'll... Wait a minute.
- What do you mean, "She'll handle it"? Hey.
- Who is she?
- Assassin.
- No, she'll chop them up into a bunch of pieces.
- Are you kidding me? I mean, these are our sort-of friends.
- Colleagues?
- Hmm.
- No, huh? It doesn't matter. No assassins. We have to handle this.
- We don't have to do anything. You're on your own.
- Come on, I thought we were a team, you and I? A damn good one.
- The team is DOA without the Intersect working.
- So why protect something that's going up in smoke, hmm?
- You wanna waste time with these idiots? You're on your own.
- [SCOFFS]
- Hey, Chuck, hold on a second.
- Do you happen to have the time?
- Amazing. Where did you learn that?
- Star Trek.
- Star Trek? Really?
- No, not really. Bangladesh.
- Meditative trancing.
- The secret is mind over matter.
- But I love the show.
- Well, who doesn't.
- [CHUCKLES]
- There is nothing in here.
- Well, what are we supposed to do now?
- Now you flash.
- How can I? I don't exactly fear death.
- WOMAN [ON PA]: Security measures will activate in four, three... two, one.
- Security measures?
- I've heard of this thing.
- The temp drops about 150 degrees in 30 seconds.
- So unless you wanna become a Chucksicle... I suggest you flash.
- [BREATHING HEAVILY]
- [BEEPING]
- It's not happening.
- Concentrate. Feel the fear lifting the rock.
- Chuck: No flash, no flash.
- Maybe Sarah can help us. Yeah, Sarah can help us.
- I got no service. What are we gonna do? My teeth are freezing.
- Chuck, can you flash?
- It's not happening.
- How about now?
- [STAMMERING] Nothing.
- How about now?
- All right. Move out of the way.
- I honestly thought you would flash.
- You knew the combination this whole time?
- We have a mission to complete. I came prepared.
- But I honestly wasn't prepared for this.
- There's more than one diamond.
- What is going on? This has gotta be worth billions of dollars.
- They can't just be diamonds. On my missions, it's never just diamonds.
- Yeah, you're right. They're working some angle.
- Do you always carry a loupe?
- Yeah, well, when I heard the mission was diamond-related... I took the liberty of grabbing a loupe out of Castle's closet.
- I took an online gemology class on the flight here.
- It was very convenient.
- Like I thought, fake. It's made of glass. But there's something embedded inside.
- Microdot.
- Replace it with our phony.
- This is a fake too.
- Great work, Bartowski.
- Now we gotta figure out what the story is on these phony diamonds.
- Chuck: Rye, I don't understand.
- A minute ago, I was truly fearing for my life. Why isn't this working?
- We need to explore a more sophisticated level of fear therapy.
- The psychological rock has keyed onto a deeper anxiety... a person... a relationship.
- With whom?
- Ah. What are you... ?
- With her.
- Well, this has been a quiet lunch.
- Uh. I should let you get back to your books.
- And you back to work.
- How is that going by the way?
- What have you heard?
- Just what Morgan's told me.
- That he's about ready to have an intervention on you.
- Look, we both know you haven't been on a mission in a while... but I think there's a little more to this than just an itchy trigger finger.
- What gives?
- I'm preparing myself psychologically... in case I get sent back to Afghanistan or Iraq.
- I got soft. I made friends here.
- Well, you know Morgan is scared of the team being broken up too.
- And if you are transferred, which might not even happen... don't you think it'd be better to be nice to your friends... than drive them away?
- Just a thought.
- [SIGHS]
- Hey, fellas.
- What are you doing? Can you tell me what this is?
- Not a lure for the new Greta.
- Do me a favor. You need to back off this Greta thing. For your own good.
- The operation is underway. You can't stop this pit bull.
- He's got a taste for meat.
- Who's gonna be meat? You guys.
- You don't scare us.
- Lester: Yeah.
- We won't be stopped. And we can't be stopped.
- And we won't be stopped.
- [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
- Lester: I think I see her. Move.
- Move.
- Hey, what are you... ?
- Hey, now! Wow, ha-ha.
- You have to stop that. I have a bad ticker.
- This is absolutely the last straw.
- They put a webcam in my locker, bugged my price g\*n.
- The psychotic one follows me, narrating, "The tracking of the Greta marmot. "
- What does that even mean?
- Which one do you think is the psychotic one? Doesn't matter.
- If they discover my identity, it'll breach national security... and a CIA facility will be at risk.
- It's time to neutralize the risk.
- Oh, hold on a second, please. They don't know anything, okay?
- You... Trust me, they have the mental capacity of field mice.
- They bother me again, they meet my favorite friend.
- Understood.
- Rye: I'm magnifying the microdot.
- God only knows what's on it.
- But it can't be good.
- We'll start the analysis and send it back to the team at Castle.
- Do you really think that Sarah is the emotional rock sitting on the Intersect?
- Why do you always call for her before you flash?
- You did it in the bedroom and in the vault.
- Yeah, well, you know, I was...
- Scared.
- Perfectly normal.
- For a Nerd Herder.
- But a spy, Chuck, handles his fear on his own.
- Or her own.
- Ask yourself a question.
- Are you a spy or are you a guy with a spy girlfriend?
- I'm a spy.
- The microdot is heavily encrypted... but it appears to contain photographs and blueprints for CIA assets.
- Belgian is selling our intel to the highest bidder.
- CHUCK [OVER MONITOR]: And there are a dozen other fake diamonds.
- Colonel Casey, Agent Walker, finish decoding the intel.
- Bartowski and Rye, capture the Belgian and recover the fake stones.
- Until we know what's on those microdots... this is code red and could likely get very ugly.
- I feel it's essential I go with Chuck and Rye to Switzerland.
- Um, I think Sarah should let us handle this... seeing as this is the only way I will get the Intersect back working.
- We're talking about real danger now.
- I can only handle fake danger?
- I know Intersect is important but none of Rye's therapies have worked.
- The microdot contains highly sensitive information the wrong people will k\*ll for.
- I can take care of these people without you holding my hand.
- Why does it make sense to risk your life?
- It's what I do, I'm a spy.
- No, Chuck, you're not.
- Not right now.
- The mission is best accomplished with the proper manpower.
- Agent Walker, get to Gstaad.
- A supersonic jet will have me there in five hours. We'll talk.
- Okay? I'm sorry Chuck. I just can't let you risk your own life.
- Greta to the cage. Greta to the cage, please.
- Greta to the cage.
- A delicious, though complicated, footlong sub... with black forest ham... honey oat...
- No, no, no.
- ... chipotle sauce and banana peppers...
- What are you doing?
- Lf she doesn't k\*ll you, I will. ... and jalape√±os... has been found with your name on it.
- So come to the cage.
- Now we wait.
- [LESTER LAUGHS]
- So I see our little lure worked, eh, Greta?
- If that is your name.
- Come, sit.
- What the hell are you doing, moron?
- Listen to me. Mm-hm.
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- We can do this the hard way or we can do this... the way... that's very difficult.
- Whoa, whoa, stop, guys. Greta, guys... quit this now.
- Lester: No.
- I have had it. This stops here and now.
- Who are you, Greta? And what do you know?
- [GASPS]
- Okay, there it is.
- There it is. We are prepared for the kn\*fe eventuality.
- Jeffrey, please disarm her.
- No.
- Whoa, mama.
- The only question is, do you wanna die with your wig on or off?
- Are you talking about my hair?
- Wait, no. Whatever you're thinking, do not do it.
- It is not worth it.
- Stand down. Now.
- Stand down.
- What is going on here?
- Her locker was full of credit card slips.
- And she was making off with the head massagers.
- She's been sneaking around because she's a thief.
- [GASPS]
- You swine. How could you do that to me after I trusted you?
- Let's go. Let's go. Come on.
- Thank you. Well, done.
- Casey, thank you.
- Mm.
- Okay, you're going downtown.
- Thief?
- How does a thief disappear into thin air?
- There's an old walkway behind the walls in the HTR for electrical repairs.
- Should have been boarded up after the fire, but she found it.
- Why did she transmogrify into a woodland creature?
- Shh.
- Why does she have a tail?
- Consider that ignored. You fellas did a great job.
- Buy More thanks you.
- That was intense. We caught a thief.
- And I need a change of trousers.
- Rye: Hey, hey, hey, Chuck, I think we got a visitor. Yep.
- The Belgian just entered the vault.
- Belgian: There's no microdot.
- Evidently, we, uh, had a security breach?
- Belgian: Get surveillance footage of the vault and the hallway.
- And meet me at the gondola.
- But the Russian buyer...
- No time for that. Pack up the diamonds. We're leaving now.
- Gondola.
- Perfect. Enclosed space, no escape.
- We'll arrest them there.
- Uh, Sarah's plane is almost here.
- Well, we can wait for her and lose him.
- Or go be heroes.
- Let's be heroes.
- Thattaboy.
- Yes.
- CHUCK [ON RECORDING]: Hey, it's Chuck. You know what to do.
- It's me again. Why aren't you getting my calls? Call me, okay?
- I love you.
- Colonel Casey, I've admired your work for years... but this outpost and its personnel... are unprofessional.
- And I'm disappointed in you.
- Well, listen, Agent Greta.
- I don't know who you've worked with or what crew you were on.
- This is the best damn spy team in the world.
- We are strong. So do us a favor, don't let the door hit you in the ass.
- [BOTH GROWL]
- [SIGHS]
- We are strong, aren't we?
- Mm.
- Yeah, even if we are missing a few pieces.
- Doesn't it feel better being part of a team... than always suffering alone.
- Right. I always forget the no-touch thing. Point taken.
- [MONITOR BEEPING]
- Oh, man. Speaking of missing pieces.
- Casey, why is Chuck on that monitor?
- This isn't good.
- [PHONE RINGS]
- Hey.
- Chuck's on the microdot.
- The Belgian knows he's the Intersect.
- Sarah: What?
- Come on, Chuck, pick up the phone.
- [PHONE RINGS]
- SARAH [OVER PHONE]: Chuck.
- Sarah.
- Where are you?
- We're about to arrest the Belgian.
- Lf anything happens, I know I'll flash.
- The Belgian knows...
- Walker, we can handle it from here.
- No, wait!
- All right, just follow my lead.
- If we get into real trouble, you'll get us out of it. You don't need Sarah.
- This is all you.
- Last chance, Chuck.
- On or off?
- On.
- Aldebert De Smet, you're coming with us.
- No, no, no. Agent Carmichael is coming with me.
- The assets in your head is worth far more... than the entire list embedded in these microchips.
- Surrender or die.
- They know I'm the Intersect.
- Scared?
- Me too.
- [SIGHS]
- Drop your w\*apon.
- No tether, no Sarah.
- We're in it up to our chins.
- How we feeling, Chuck?
- Not great.
- I sort of flashed, but I'm not sure.
- All right. Well, let's find out.
- [ALL GRUNTING]
- [GRUNTS]
- Rye.
- Rye!
- Two hundred feet to the rocks below.
- Talk about some serious danger, huh?
- Ow.
- Anything?
- No. No, nothing yet.
- Believe me, I'm plenty terrified. Help me up.
- Sorry, Chuck, not gonna happen.
- What? No. My hands are slipping.
- Rye, I may actually die right now.
- Fantastic. This is your final test. The wind's picking up.
- You're looking death in the face. Only thing that can save you is Intersect.
- Focus, Chuck. You can do this.
- [CHUCK GROANING]
- No, this is crazy. It's not coming back.
- But you know the rock is Sarah.
- Tell yourself you don't need her and give in to the fear.
- But I do need her. I love her.
- I'd rather love Sarah than have the Intersect. Help me up.
- The CIA didn't send me out here to affirm your love, Bartowski.
- You need the Intersect up and running. Now, get that rock off your chest... and be a real spy like me.
- Did I just get sh\*t?
- No, no, no.
- I certainly did.
- Grab my hand or die.
- Come on.
- [PHONE RINGS]
- What's going on? Where are you?
- Pursue Agent Carmichael and we will k\*ll him.
- Slowly.
- There will be no further warning.
- No. Please wait.
- General, I want immediate authorization to hunt down this son of a bitch.
- I would grant if there was indication De Smet was in Belgium.
- There's no indication of his whereabouts.
- They were at Gstaad Airport.
- I have a witness who saw them board a private jet, tail number CLM...
- CLM1211. I know, Agent Walker.
- The plane didn't just disappear. It had to have landed somewhere.
- We put a code red out to every clandestine agency on the planet.
- The moment there's a sign of Chuck, we'll mobilize every resource.
- Colonel Casey, you've got your mission. You're running point.
- And me?
- Sarah, he's out there. We'll find him.
- But until there's intel, go home and get some rest.
- You'll be informed of any developments.
- I'm staying right here.
- You're going home. That's an order.
- [SIGHS]
- Bartowski's smart. Intersect or no, he'll be fine.
- This is all my fault.
- He did this to prove to me that he could be a spy.
- [CHUCK BREATHING HEAVILY]
- [GRUNTS]
- What do you want?
- I want the Intersect.
- What are you doing, Walker?
- [SIGHS]
- I'm gonna go find Chuck.
- We'll go together.
- Wherever he is, we will find him and we'll bring him back.
- Thank you.
- I don't have it, Mr. Belgian... De Smet.
- It's gone. I lost it.
- Please, Agent Carmichael, don't take me for a fool.
- The less you resist, the less painful this will be.
