# Chuck Versus the Suitcase

- Chuck: Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things you might need to know.
- We spared no expense recreating the Buy More.
- It's now a full-fledged CIA-NSA substation.
- I'm pregnant. Ha, ha.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Alex, I'm your father.
- If Volkoff has any intel on my mom, we need to try and find it.
- Marko: Someone's looking for you.
- Who?
- Your family.
- Have you told Volkoff anything?
- I told him nothing.
- That's good.
- Devon: Okay, we're a man down.
- You step it up while Ellie's out of commission.
- Devon, I'm 13 weeks pregnant.
- Exactly. We've already lost 13 weeks.
- A lot of decisions need to be made.
- Natural or water birth? Ergo or Baby BjÃ♪rn?
- Spanish or French as a second language?
- Are we gonna blow it wide open and go Japanese?
- Baby's not due for another six months.
- You still have time.
- Exactly. Thank you.
- And besides, tomorrow is Chuck's first day back at Buy More.
- Ahem.
- Oh, and Morgan's.
- Thank you. Little acknowledgement goes a long way.
- Not that big a deal. Morgan and I have worked for the Buy More before.
- Well, it's still exciting. And it's safe.
- [YAWNING] It's safe and exciting.
- You tired, babe, huh? I know you haven't been sleeping well.
- Is the baby resting on your spleen?
- Okay, you have to relax.
- The baby is the size of a walnut.
- Hey, hey. Watch your tone.
- Eardrums develop in week 12.
- Little walnut can hear everything you say.
- What is happening?
- I have no idea.
- You should be taking some notes. You could be next.
- Ho, ho! Whoa. Oh, I don't...
- Oh, I...
- I'm...
- Morgan: I don't know.
- Sarah would have to unpack first for them to think about starting a family.
- Snow pea?
- Do you think it's weird I haven't unpacked yet?
- What? No. No, no, no. Of course not. I mean, it's only been eight months.
- Right, and, uh, and I've been on missions practically the entire time... and I have to go away again soon.
- Totally. I get it. You know I get it.
- Don't listen to Morgan. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
- Guy eats cereal with a fork.
- So you're okay with it.
- You're here. That's all that matters to me.
- Okay?
- It's not weird at all.
- Chuck: It's totally weird, right?
- Morgan: Of course it is.
- I mean, she won't put one thing in her side of the closet. Not a thing.
- It's like she'd rather be on a mission than back home with me.
- Well, it's just when everything seems great, that's usually when you find it, man.
- Find... Find... Find what?
- The Achilles heel. Every relationship has one.
- A singular problem that can't be overcome... even in the greatest romances.
- Romeo and Juliet, Tristan and Isolde... Anakin and Padmé.
- Are you saying, then, that Sarah not unpacking is our Achilles Heel?
- Keep your feelings to yourself, okay? You don't wanna give her reason to bolt.
- BECKMAN [ON PA]: Chuck Bartowski, please report to the manager's office.
- Duty calls. Thanks for the talk, buddy.
- Of course.
- [MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
- Roger that. Gentlemen.
- Customer: It is on sale?
- How you guys doing?
- So, uh, I'm Agent Grimes.
- [WHISPERS] Special Ops.
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] I know you're all undercover spies, but I'm familiar with the Buy More.
- If you have any questions, feel free ask, take a break, we'll...
- We're working. We don't take breaks.
- You're a very tiny man, aren't you?
- Uh, you looked in a mirror lately?
- You're, um...
- Just quite impressive, to be honest.
- It's really just... A physical specimen.
- I used to be like that... Oh. Gonna pick... ? Gonna one-arm that thing?
- Okay, that's, uh...
- I used to do that myself, but I forgot my weight belt.
- One of our agents was k\*ll in Milan last night... while he was tracking this woman.
- Sofia Stefanova.
- Hiyo.
- Who do we have taking our surveillance pics? Because those are tremendous.
- Can you see the way... ?
- Uh. What? No. No, no, no.
- I'm just saying, clearly... In a bathing suit? I didn't notice that.
- We can all acknowledge that Miss Stefanova is quite fetching.
- Mm.
- But don't be fooled by her appearance.
- We believe she's the executor... of Volkoff's most important w\*apon deals.
- Uses her cover as a runway model to travel the world... get access to the most powerful people... and deliver w\*apon like this.
- Stefanova stole an amm\*nit\*on clip containing smart b\*ll\*ts... from a w\*apon development facility outside Paris.
- Mr. Bartowski.
- Uh, what are smart b\*ll\*ts?
- [BUZZES]
- Microchip-controlled. They have a built-in GPS.
- The b\*llet guides itself to the target.
- Yeah. Something a good spy would never need.
- You should get some.
- Beckman: That's exactly what I need you to do.
- Stefanova plans to sell the w\*apon at a party during Milan Fashion Week.
- I'm sending you two to intercept them.
- Colonel Casey... after the Yves St. Laurent incident... you will have to sit this one out.
- Stab one guy with a stiletto.
- Beckman: Bartowski, Walker... you leave immediately.
- Packed and ready to go, general.
- [WHISPERS] Now, there's a woman in love.
- Hmm.
- No one loves a mission more than Walker.
- [CLICKS]
- Casey: You be on your guard out there.
- Volkoff and his people... they're serious.
- Yeah, yeah. No, I, uh, I got it.
- But, uh, the closer I get to finding Volkoff, the closer I get to finding my mom.
- Well, I won't be able to rescue your ass. I'll be stuck here.
- Stuck here. Come on, Casey.
- You know you like Burbank a little.
- Okay, granted.
- We'd rather be on the Amalfi Coast or Bora-Bora.
- But don't you feel a bit at home here?
- Yeah, I guess.
- As much as Darfur... or that cave in Afghanistan.
- Unh, okay, but then, supposing there was someone...
- Could there be someone... who makes you feel even a little more at home?
- Like Alex. You see her a lot, right?
- No.
- No? She's your daughter.
- Spies don't put down roots.
- That's the rule.
- [SCOFFS]
- Rule. That's not a rule. It's a notion or a suggestion or guideline.
- It's about that Achilles heel thing.
- Achilles... ? How do you know... ?
- Grimes told me.
- That pipsqueak will talk to anyone he thinks is listening.
- [g\*n CLICKS]
- Chuck, beautiful women have a lot of baggage.
- You should be happy Walker's is just a suitcase.
- Any sign of Sofia?
- No. Not yet. Strapless Versace, huh?
- Very daring, Agent Walker.
- How much Project Runway have you been watching?
- There she is.
- Gotta be in the purse.
- Chuck: Smart b\*ll\*ts?
- All right. I got this one.
- Ah.
- Excuse me?
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm nobody. This is nothing.
- No, I wasn't trying to do that. Put my hand on your bottom.
- Your hand is still touching my perfection.
- So it is.
- So sorry. That was an accident.
- Happy accident. Kind of. Not really.
- Uh, but I'm not a weirdo pervert by any stretch.
- Then what are you doing here?
- I'm here with, uh...
- Oh, I see.
- Oh.
- No harm done.
- [SIGHS]
- You get it?
- Not exactly.
- I had a little awkward moment there.
- What happened?
- Went for the purse, she turned then my hand was very...
- I mean, it was very lightly on her... Kind of...
- Really not that important.
- Ugh. She's still at the bar.
- No. She's going.
- He's taking her purse.
- What? Who is?
- The bartender.
- She's already made the drop.
- Hand it over.
- [IN ITALIAN]
- Okay.
- Uh, Sarah.
- She knew we were coming.
- Let's go.
- Okay, remain calm. Remain calm.
- Should I throw it?
- [b\*mb CLICKS]
- Why did it click? Clicks are bad.
- A pressure sensor. If you let go, it'll explode.
- [LAUGHS]
- Go, quick, quick, quick. Quick.
- Do what you do. Ahem.
- [b\*mb TICKING QUICKLY]
- Sarah, listen.
- I can't die without you knowing that I accept you for who you are.
- Your unpacking, it doesn't matter to me.
- Nothing matters. I still love you.
- [SIGHS]
- [CHUCKLES]
- You still love me?
- Sorry, what? What?
- Did I... ?
- Those weren't the best last words, were they?
- Top three things you can do with a Roomba. Number three, go.
- This new Buy More has changed a lot, and I don't think it's for the better.
- Casey: Shut up, Grimes.
- Ha, ha.
- Dude, what is up with the Buy More? Everyone is, like, scary efficient.
- Hadn't noticed.
- Hadn't noticed, either.
- Man: Bull's-eye.
- Oh.
- Twenty-five feet. I can do better.
- Okay. Tell me not everyone in here is a spy.
- Chuck promised Ellie he's not working for the CIA anymore.
- I'm worried. She's not sleeping as it is. If she even thought Chuck was still a spy...
- Bartowski is out.
- Buy More is still my cover.
- Sadly, that hasn't changed.
- I don't know.
- Something about this place still seems...
- Off?
- Thirty feet.
- That's more like it.
- Devon: So where is Chuck?
- We make a great team, you and I.
- You are such a day-saver. I am super proud of you. I really am.
- Proud of us, really. How well we work together.
- Sarah: Any sign of Sofia?
- Uh, no. Are you mad at me?
- If the w\*apon wasn't in her purse, she didn't have it with her at the party... because that dress didn't conceal much.
- I wasn't... I wasn't looking.
- I wasn't looking, first of all. It's a very stressful situation... watching one's life flash before one's eyes like that.
- And at the end of the day, you have to admit, I did say I love you.
- That's what should matter.
- Lf we hadn't have stopped that b\*mb... your last words would've been about my weird unpacking thing.
- Sorry. I should never have done that.
- I don't even care. I don't. Spies pack light. I get it.
- Yes. We do pack light.
- We have to be prepared for the next mission.
- And right now we really need to focus on this mission.
- Let's go, Chuck.
- [KNOCKING ON DOOR]
- Can I help you, Mr. Grimes?
- Yes. I'd like to talk to you... about how well things are going here at the Buy More.
- Things do seem to be running quite smoothly.
- Exactly. Yeah, uh, that seems to be the problem to me.
- It's too right that it's wrong.
- And tell me, Mr. Grimes... what do you know about running a CIA base?
- Nothing.
- But I do know how to run a Buy More.
- And, with all due respect, general, this is no longer a Buy More.
- You have five minutes.
- Only need two. Walk with me.
- One of the characteristics of old Buy More was inattention to detail.
- For example: Take this generic yet tasty chocolate drink, right?
- Now, a year ago, this would have sat...
- Oh. For about a week until Jeff came and lapped it up off the floor.
- Here, this one's fresher. Enjoy.
- My people were trained to be observant and efficient. It's the CIA way.
- Aah, but it's not the Buy More way. You see?
- If customers don't have hazardous spills, mislabeled products... surly employees to distract them, they may start to enjoy their time.
- Let's continue.
- I don't wanna be an astronaut anymore, Mommy.
- I wanna work at the Buy More.
- First you gotta stay in school, little man.
- No one should ever, ever want to work here.
- You have to look at the big picture.
- A pleased customer will wanna stay in the store longer... wanna bring his friends, his family, tying up valuable CIA resources.
- Not to mention, encouraging them to look a little deeper.
- What happens? What happens when they do look a little deeper?
- Maybe just one customer discovers... what's really going on here.
- [GRUNTS]
- General, look... if even I can see through this cover... what's an enemy spy gonna think?
- What do you propose?
- You look really pretty right now.
- Hmm, just saying, with the bl\*od rushing to your head... it brings out the color in your cheeks.
- Hey. Spider-Man kiss?
- No.
- Okay. Maybe later. Hmm.
- Unh, if I could just... Here we go.
- And down.
- I see Sofia stays in the presidential suite.
- And they say crime doesn't pay.
- Hmm.
- Sarah: Hmm?
- Huh? What?
- Uh, it's nothing. Nothing.
- No, please. Say it, Chuck.
- It's not a spy thing per se.
- What's not a spy thing?
- Unpacking. Not a spy thing.
- I mean, not every spy has issue with it, like some spies do, you know.
- Clearly, because Sofia felt comfortable enough to settle herself in... and it's only a hotel room. Just thinking out loud.
- Hmm. Thank you for that.
- There's a safe in the corner here.
- Oh, nice. Good eye.
- [DOOR OPENS]
- Gerard: Everything looks secure here, ma'am.
- Miss Sofia, can we have a moment to talk?
- Just stand guard. That's what you're here for.
- [BEEPING]
- [WHISPERS] What do we do now?
- [WHISPERS] We cant leave without the w\*apon.
- Can you see anything?
- Are you serious?
- No, I'm serious.
- What, are you kidd... ? Who do you think I am?
- If we can't see anything, then she cant see anything either, right?
- Right. Okay. Well... l'll get the guard, you get the safe.
- Break.
- Miss Sofia.
- Don't turn around.
- I have something I need to tell you, Miss Sofia. I love you.
- [g\*n COCKS]
- Sofia: Don't move.
- [MUMBLES]
- Look at me.
- Okay, you should know that I have a girlfriend.
- Gerard: For so many years, I've been your muscle.
- But you know, the strongest muscle in my body... is my heart.
- And now it belongs to you.
- Sorry.
- Ugh!
- Who do you work for? How'd you find me?
- I'd love to get into this. Is it possible to cover yourself with maybe a towel?
- Ha... ! Hey.
- Hmm.
- Is she naked?
- Who?
- Yes. Yes, she is.
- Sofia: Unh!
- Sarah: Chuck, run!
- Chuck: Move!
- [CHUCK GRUNTS]
- You get the w\*apon?
- You bet.
- Stop!
- Put some clothes on.
- Chuck: Whoa.
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
- Right, understood. I will put a team on it tomorrow.
- Yes. And thank you for shopping at the Buy More.
- Everything going well upstairs?
- Too well.
- Unfortunately, I can't say the same for things down here.
- Your work in Milan was excellent.
- But we've analyzed the chips you brought back.
- They're not functional.
- What do you mean, not functional?
- They're fakes.
- Sofia was one step ahead of us.
- Must've hidden the real chips somewhere else.
- Interpol and FSB are looking for her now... so all we can do is sit tight until she pops back up on the radar.
- [COMPUTER BEEPS]
- Sorry to disturb you, but there's a man from the Better Business Bureau... here to bestow the Buy More with an Award for Excellence.
- He needs the manager to accept it.
- I'll be right there.
- We need new bl\*od upstairs.
- Hopefully your woolly friend, Mr. Grimes, will come through.
- Wha... ? Um, come... What? Come through with what?
- Let's just say he's recruiting.
- Day 184... still running from the po-po.
- Oh, sweet Buy More... why and how did we ever burn you?
- It's been, uh, dark days.
- We've been taking gigs at the Whisper Lounge... in exchange for scraps of tapas which...
- And we live here now... in the wild.
- With my van.
- Where no one can find us.
- It's not all bad.
- Expanding my understanding of Universal Mind.
- Jeff has a new pet rock named Bruce.
- I asked him, "Why Bruce? " He said when he hits it, doesn't bruise.
- [CASEY GRUNTS]
- Why do you bother with these idiots?
- They may be idiots, but they're my idiots.
- Buy More's my home for eight years. Without Jeff and Lester... it would just feel like another electronics store.
- Do you ever miss Ace of Base?
- Always.
- [SQUEALS]
- Lester: Jeffrey, we've been made.
- The su1c1de pills. Go down like Thelma and Louise.
- Like we practiced. Thelma and/or Louise.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- They're everywhere.
- Wait, wait. I got this.
- We're not the boys you're looking for.
- Not the boys...
- Cut it out. Listen to me.
- We just came here to give you your jobs back.
- What job?
- Your old jobs. Buy More's been rebuilt.
- Nobody thinks that you b\*rned it down.
- What? Cars have been following us for months.
- How do you know they weren't just driving behind you?
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- You came all this way... just to offer us our jobs back?
- You're seven minutes from Burbank.
- No, no, no. No, no, no. I see what's happening here, Jeffrey.
- For some unknown reason, they need us.
- We have leverage.
- Lester: It's time to negotiate.
- All right, if we take our jobs back... we want a raise... and perks.
- The company car and three kilos...
- Ha-ha-ha! Free biscotti.
- I think my water just broke.
- [MOANS]
- Truly one of the most degrading things I've ever done.
- You'd rather be on a mission, but your life doesn't have to be missions.
- I was talking to Alex. She hadn't heard from you in a while.
- Why are you talking to my daughter?
- More importantly, why aren't you talking to her?
- Well, she has her mom, friends.
- A whole life, I just don't fit in.
- You're not gonna if you don't try.
- [GROANS]
- Hey, Devon. Need some help?
- No. No, no, no. I'm good.
- Just shopping. But I was in the Buy More.
- Everyone there was super attractive and highly k\*ll.
- It was like I work there.
- But why would I work in the Buy More?
- Hmm?
- Unless I was a spy.
- Um, you know Casey and I are still spies and the Buy More is still a cover.
- Chuck has nothing to do with it.
- Exactly.
- I'm out, bro.
- I know. I know, man. I'm sorry I questioned you.
- And I know I've been going a little overboard lately.
- But it's just really important for Ellie, you know... to know that everyone who is here is really here for her now.
- That everything is normal.
- Yeah, to...
- Totally normal.
- [IN SPANISH ACCENT] "Normal. "
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] As the Spanish would say. Ha.
- [IN SPANISH ACCENT] Not irregular.
- Thank you. All right.
- Oh, let me help.
- No, babe, I got it. You don't lift a finger.
- What is all this?
- Oh, just, uh, a few sleep machines.
- You know, rainforest sounds, white noise, dolphin chatter. The ushe.
- Uh, that's very sweet of you, but you've done so much already.
- Look at the apartment. You have two bassinets.
- We have a kitchen full of baby vegan food.
- Sweetheart, we are not vegan.
- But we could be.
- I just wanna know what's really going on here.
- We both know that you're not good at letting people help you.
- You've practically raised Chuck on your own since your mom...
- This is about my mom?
- No. What?
- No.
- Devon... you are the worst liar in the world.
- Just tell me. Is this about my mom?
- Yes.
- I don't want you to feel anyone or anything missing.
- Well, I don't want you to be worried. I don't feel like anything is missing.
- I didn't need my mom when I was a teenager.
- I didn't need her in med school and I don't need her now, okay?
- You and Chuck are the only family that I need.
- Okay.
- Okay. So let's make a deal.
- I will let you help me, but you have to let me pitch in too.
- We're better as a team.
- Don't do that.
- What?
- Don't unpack, please.
- If you do it now it's only because we were talking about it.
- I don't want it because of that. Do it when you feel comfortable here.
- I do feel comfortable here. It just...
- It doesn't come naturally to me, putting roots down.
- I know.
- You were always on the run and being a spy doesn't make it easy... to make a home anywhere. I understand.
- It's just what you're used to.
- But I love you... because we're different.
- And one dress... is not going to make or break us.
- One dress.
- What?
- Sofia unpacked everything except for that one sequin dress.
- Right. She put it in a suitcase. Haven't we seen that dress before?
- Security cam footage.
- Why wear the same dress twice when she has a closet full of options?
- Because maybe it's not just a dress.
- The technology's in the microchip, not the b\*llet.
- The chips...
- Hidden in the dress.
- The sequins.
- Fashion Week ends... slip the dress through Customs.
- The collections. She's still in Milan.
- Closing night is tomorrow night. We need to get back there now.
- It's a good thing we're already packed.
- [STATIC REVENGER'S "I LIKE THAT" PLAYING]
- Sofia is hiding the dress in one of those collections.
- It should be in one of the backstage areas.
- I'm gonna guess it's that one.
- Those look like our men.
- Sarah: Think this will work?
- Absolutely. Watch me.
- [CHUCKLES]
- [SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]
- It's a pleasure to meet you. It's a pleasure, pleasure.
- My name is Charles Carmichael... and I know that's gotta be confusing right now. Let me explain.
- I'm actually the guy that you're looking for.
- I'm gonna need the dress behind that door.
- And good night.
- Went better than I thought it would.
- What? You don't have any faith in my tranq gloves? Come on.
- I'm pretty proud of them.
- Okay, you take that side.
- The right... Okay. Then you go... Okay.
- Excuse, me.
- We need to be quick, remember.
- Going as fast as I can. A lot of dresses here.
- None of those.
- Oh, bingo. Bingo. Hey, check it out.
- Found it.
- Good.
- Okay.
- Whoa. Hiyo.
- I just gotta say, this was a great idea.
- I mean, as far as missions, best ever. Ha, ha.
- Zip.
- Ahem. Of course, yes. You hold... and I zip: Slip back into this and Bob's your uncle.
- Bra.
- Of course, strapless.
- What was I thinking?
- Okay.
- Let's go home.
- Shall we?
- Guard: Try here!
- [BANGING ON DOOR]
- Okay. Slight problem.
- Sarah: Uh, there. Go.
- [MAN SHOUTS IN ITALIAN]
- Stop! Stop!
- Chuck: Unh.
- I love you, Sarah.
- Chuck!
- [g\*n]
- [g\*n COCKS]
- I think you've got something of mine.
- [GRUNTING]
- Drop it.
- Unh!
- Whoa.
- Five on one, five on one. Yeah, not the greatest odds.
- I get it. I get it.
- [ALL GRUNTING]
- You messed things up with Miss Sofia.
- No... I didn't mess up anything. You really didn't stand a chance.
- She's cold and distant and ris...
- Here we go.
- That's no... Here, could you hold that just for a second?
- Thanks.
- What I'm looking for.
- You slapped me.
- Well... Agh!
- [GRUNTING]
- [PANTING]
- Sofia: Red is a good look for you.
- It distracts from your face.
- [BOTH GRUNTING]
- [PEOPLE SCREAMING]
- [CROWD GASPS]
- [SHOUTS IN ITALIAN]
- I assure you, general, my cover is still intact.
- I know. The two of you acted quickly and intelligently.
- Because of your efforts, we recovered the guidance chips... and put one of Volkoff's key sellers behind bars.
- Feels good to be back at work.
- Feels good to be home.
- Hey. I made you a protein shake with a baby boost, babe.
- Thanks, honey. I'm actually headed out, though.
- My husband bought sleep machines in excess the other day.
- I'm headed to Buy More to return them.
- No.
- I mean, it was my fault. I should return them.
- I think I can handle it.
- Hey... we're a team, remember?
- Oh, ha, ha. Mm, right, absolutely.
- Yeah. Okay.
- Well, don't feel like you gotta spend a ton of time there, huh? Ha, ha. Hurry home.
- All right.
- [PHONE RINGS]
- Hey, Devon.
- Dude, the hen has left the nest.
- The hen... What?
- Ellie is en route to the Buy More.
- Okay.
- Bro, I know you're not a spy... but is Ellie gonna believe that when she sees the new Buy More?
- Electronics, roll left. Entertainment, right.
- Okay.
- I'll get this for you. Mm-hm.
- Oh, thank you.
- Woman: Absolutely.
- Is this what you're looking for?
- Oh, this is perfect.
- [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
- EI, hey.
- Hi.
- Welcome to the new Buy More.
- Yeah, what... ? What's going on? This place seems so strange.
- You know, it could be the, uh... the current corporate restructuring going on. Everybody is just...
- Yeah, well, the... Excuse me. Sorry.
- Uh, the restructuring has actually been restructured.
- So although it may appear a bit off... I can assure you that Buy More is, well, the Buy More.
- [GRUNTING]
- Hi. Can one of you help me?
- No.
- We're on break.
- Rumor has it you're pregnant.
- Is there room in that womb for two?
- Chuck: Run along, Jeff.
- Let me know.
- Some things will never change.
- Well, I'm still here to help.
- Told you. Just like normal.
- [SIGHS]
- Mr. Grimes.
- Diane.
- Ahem. General.
- My superiors have been monitoring the Buy More.
- And they believe your additions have made for an airtight cover.
- I think you have earned this.
- Thank you so much. Yeah.
- What have I earned exactly?
- The keys to the Buy More.
- Aah.
- I'm making you store manager, Mr. Grimes.
- I'm sorry. I think what you meant to say was Assistant Store Manager.
- Don't make me regret this.
- I'm manager?
- I'm manager?
- Beckman: Congratulations, Grimes.
- Guys.
- What, Morgan? I'm trying to relax here.
- Drinks on me tonight.
- [CHEERING]
- Thank you, buddy. Thank you.
- Well drinks. And happy hour.
- Same old Morgan.
- Wanna come get a drink with us, big guy?
- No, I have some mission prep I have to take care of.
- Uh, Casey.
- How's Burbank ever gonna feel like home if you don't give it a chance?
- Yeah. The Buy More may be your home, but it's not mine.
- Alex. Hi, it's me.
- Dad.
- Good to hear your voice too.
- I'm mixing it up a bit tonight and we're going sparkling.
- It's official.
- What's official?
- Oh, you didn't have...
- I wanted to.
- I've never had a real home and I wanted this to feel like one.
- Let me help you.
- [GASPS]
- What's this?
- Uh, that's just something that I like to keep in my suitcase... at all times.
- Whether I'm in Portugal... or Russia... or Burbank.
- This, uh, makes me feel comfortable.
- Safe.
- Look, I know that it's probably taken me longer than a normal girl.
- But you should know that you're my home, Chuck.
- You always have been.
- Ooh!
- Ha-ha-ha.
- What?
- Nothing.
- Nothing. It's just some...
- Some stupid thing that Morgan said, that's all. Ahem.
- What did he say?
- You can tell me.
- He said just when you think your relationship is perfect... then you find your Achilles heel, the thing that's going to destroy it.
- You thought ours was the suitcase?
- It's a stupid theory. It's nonsense. It's Morgan, who are we kidding?
- We don't have an Achilles heel.
- We have a real future... ahead of us.
- Mm.
- [SIGHS]
- Maybe Awesome is right.
- You know, marriage, a baby.
- Who knows, maybe we're next?
