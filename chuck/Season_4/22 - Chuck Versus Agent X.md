# Chuck Versus Agent X

- Hi I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know.
- El, I need to talk to you about Dad's computer.
- Yeah, I thought that I uncovered some secret files. Turned out just to be cheats on some video game that he was developing.
- My sister just lied to me.
- She's never lied to me.
- Vivian: There was only one man my father was ever afraid of.
- He went by the name Agent X.
- I'm going to track him down and k*ll him.
- Then no one can touch me, ever.
- (g*n cocks)
- Man: Freeze!
- Take it easy, Tiger, I'm-I'm here to help.
- DS&T picked up some chatter of a possible break-in attempt.
- Not likely.
- It's always a ghost town down here.
- Oh, damn it.
- I'm sorry, I haven't had my morning coffee yet.
- Let me, um... help.
- (giggles)
- Who says chivalry is dead?
- (giggles)
- (groans)
- Good work.
- I knew there was a reason I brought you, outside of the obvious, of course.
- (sighs)
- (sighs)
- (whirr, latch clanks)
- Riley: Mm...
- That's the computer with all the Agent X files?
- (soft beep) No, it's a tracker.
- Somebody must be using the computer.
- But it looks as if the CIA is keeping tabs.
- Locate this signal, and we'll have exactly what Miss Volkoff wants.
- This was too easy.
- Have to imagine the CIA is being way more careful with the actual computer.
- Oh, sh**t.
- Ellie, come on.
- Hey, babe, doing a little last-minute prep for Chuck's bachelor party.
- Can you give me a little sunscreen pre-coat?
- Sure...
- Uh, make sure you lube up the lats.
- Gonna be sunny in Vegas.
- Captain: What's with the old house?
- That? I figured out a cyclomatic complexity that ran through all the conditionals in my dad's research-- that's the end of the loop.
- Awesome. All paths seem to end at that photo.
- I don't understand-- why would my dad want me to have this picture of an old house?
- What are you doing, El?
- Aren't you supposed to be getting ready for Sarah's bachelorette party?
- Honey, don't worry.
- Clara's already at your parents' house, I am all packed for our girls' day trip; I promise I will turn it off as soon as the festivities begin.
- Okay? Fair enough.
- Gonna finish packing for the dude trip.
- Vegas, baby. Vegas... !
- ♪ ♪
- Lester: Yo.
- May I ask the best man what casino we're going to be hitting first?
- I got a fat stack burning a hole in my crotch.
- I-I don't think that's, uh...
- Oh, no; it's burning.
- Uh, no-no idea, actually.
- I put Awesome in charge of everything.
- Apparently, he's the Vegas expert.
- Nice. Yeah.
- What about you, Casey?
- Any casino preferences?
- No. Forget the casinos.
- Best thing about Vegas are the g*n ranges.
- Brought some of my fancytargets.
- Well, I got some bad news.
- See you guys on Monday.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hang on, Big Michael.
- You're not coming?
- Bologna Grimes says I couldn't go.
- She knows I tapped Vegas dry back when I was with Earth, Wind, Fire, and Rain.
- You want me to call this Baloney lady, give her the what for?
- Big Mike: Nah.
- Once Bologna has made a decision, there's no going back on it.
- You guys enjoy.
- No!
- No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no.
- Hold on a second. Hold on a second.
- Y-You are my future stepfather.
- This will not stand.
- Now, come on... We're men!
- Men who take what's theirs!
- You have to march into that house, slam your fist on the counter, and then you look at my mother in the eye, and you say, "Bologna, I am so sorry, woman... "
- "... but I have to work at the Buy More all weekend. "
- You see, this way, when she asks me,
- I'll say, "Yeah, we got all this new inventory.
- We have to work around the clock. " Boom! Boom.
- Heh.
- That's the greatest thing... a white person's ever done for me.
- (sobbing)
- Let's go to Vegas!
- Chuck: Vegas, Vegas.
- What does a bachelor wear in Vegas?
- I can't believe you've never been to Vegas.
- And, by the way, a bachelor does not wear that.
- What? You're not digging the whole business up-top, party below-the-waist thing? I figured it covered all the Vegas activities with one fell swoop.
- Speaking of "looks, " you're sure doing an awful lot of maintenance over there.
- Oh, I'm just reminding you of what you'll be missing out on in Vegas.
- Oh, trust me, I'll remember.
- Where's Ellie taking you guys anyway?
- I'm not sure.
- Every time I do recon, she's on your dad's computer.
- She spends a lot of time on that thing.
- Yeah, well, Ellie's always been into puzzles; you know, logic puzzles, Sudoku, crosswords-- I mean, one of my earliest memories of my sister was when she solved the 12-sided Rubik's Cube before I even got mine out of the box.
- Have you spoken to Devon yet?
- Told him that you know that Ellie is still using the computer? No.
- Not yet.
- I'm planning on having a good man-to-man talk as soon as we get to Vegas.
- I mean, it's the perfect place to have a sincere, honest, heartfelt conversation.
- You really have never been to Vegas, have you?
- Chuck: Awesome... !
- (banging on door) Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Uh... just a minute, Chuck!
- Coming!
- (sighing): Hi.
- Hi.
- What's up? I was just, uh, I was reading a book.
- You don't have to lie to me, Ellie.
- I know you're planning Sarah's bachelorette party-- come on, we've all got some secrets.
- Don't we Awesome?
- You don't know the half of it, bro.
- Let me tell you something.
- This weekend...
- (whispers): I'm going to make a man out of you.
- Goody! Can't wait for that.
- Okay, well, you guys have fun. Be safe, and I'm just... I'm going to do stuff.
- Okay. Okay.
- Bye. Bye.
- Jasmine: We finally have a lock on the Orion computer signal.
- (beeping)
- Echo Park, Los Angeles.
- Perfect. Let's move.

Original Air Date on May 2, 2011
- Captain: All right, boys.
- I want you to get ready.
- Even if you've been to the City of Sin before, you've never been with me.
- Awesome, thank you so much for planning this trip.
- Dude, you kidding? I live for this.
- Captain: Okay, we need to think of this weekend like a w*r.
- Now you're talking my language.
- When we get there, we immediately take over The Strip.
- High rollin' on The Strip!
- Morgan: What the... Ow! Ow!
- What are you doing? ! I'm making it rain--
- Canadian style-- which is, technically, making it snow.
- (as Wu Tang): Dolla dolla coins, y'all!
- Boom!
- Casey: Save the Socialist funny money.
- Captain: And save your energy.
- Vegas is the land of excess.
- For those of you who like to chase tail, there is plenty of that, too.
- Rest up, boys...
- 'cause we might not sleep again for a long time.
- (all whooping, clapping)
- Ellie: bachelorette weekend. l
- Cheers.
- So, are you going to let me in on the big secret?
- What have you got planned for tomorrow?
- Okay, we are going to a spa in Santa Barbara, and we're not just doing massages we're doing body scrubs, too.
- Wow, uh...
- That sounds very... relaxing.
- Get ready for some hardcore aromatherapy.
- (tires screech)
- Captain: All right, boys!
- Let's tear this town a new one!
- Yeah! Woo-hoo! (indistinct shout)
- (shrieking): Whoo!
- Lester: Whoo! Whoo!
- (all laughing and cheering)
- Welcome to Las Vecas, boys!
- (laughs)
- Captain, what's, uh, what's-what's going on?
- This is not Las Vegas.
- Las Vecas, buddy. Look!
- So this whole time you've been saying "Las Ve-cas"?
- Of course! What else would I be saying?
- Las Vegas. Hold on a second, I heard you say we're going to the City of Sin.
- This is the City of Cinn... amon Falls.
- After the famous waterfall.
- The locals call it the "City of Cinn. "
- What about taking over The Strip?
- Yeah, the old mining strip. It's next to the campsite.
- I thought we were going to chase tail.
- There's a huge yellow-bellied marmot population.
- They love being chased.
- Long as I can set up a g*n range.
- Yeah, nature's g*n range-- the great outdoors.
- Hey. You okay, buddy?
- I know that you were looking forward to partying in Vegas most of all.
- What? I knew we were going to Vecas!
- Oh. This place is amazing!
- They grow some magic fungus up in them there hills.
- I'm going to go find some; maybe chase a little tail.
- That's the spirit, big guy!
- Yeah! Let's get unpacked.
- Sarah: Well, I better go unpack and rest up for the big day.
- Rest up? This is your bachelorette party.
- We have to get you tired before you can rest.
- Tired? Come on...
- Women: Surprise!
- ♪ ♪
- Yeah!
- Come on, you didn't think I was just going to take you to some lame spa, right?
- I tried to call the girls from the CAT squad, but they were away in Libya somewhere, so I invited a few of the Wienerlicious girls and some friends from the hospital.
- Thank you. This is a very nice surprise.
- I know it's not going to be like as crazy as Vegas, but, uh, we'll have a few drinks, see where the night takes us.
- Okay. Okay.
- (cell phone vibrates)
- Captain: All right, boys.
- Get ready for the bachelor party hike.
- I figure we can forage for our supper out there. (laughs)
- I do not forage.
- Okay, look, guys, I know this isn't exactly Las Vegas, but Awesome worked really hard putting this all together, you know?
- Got to admire the man for sticking to his strategy.
- Morgan: Sure, and you know what? A hike actually sounds pretty invigorating right now.
- I've never hiked in a tie. I know, right? Yeah.
- Get the bl*od pumping.
- I mean, it could be just as fun as Vegas.
- 'Cause this weekend is-is... it's about bonding after all, isn't it?
- No. No, it isn't.
- Big Mike: Not at all. It's about steaks and gambling and-and getting into in some weird stuff that just might haunt you the rest of your life.
- Amen. Michael, may I have a word with you over there by that crappy tree?
- Listen.
- I have a plan.
- Don't bother telling me-- I'm in.
- All right.
- You were the best, wiener girl.
- Hey, Chuck, listen, the secure CIA location has been compromised, and we need to bring in the Orion computer immediately.
- Can you please call me back and tell me where your sister keeps it, okay? Call me.
- Okay, game time!
- Let's give our bride-to-be a toilet paper dress!
- Oh, listen, Ellie, can we please talk? I want...
- Ellie, wait. We need to talk.
- Okay, Ellie, no, this...
- Listen, this can't wait. Okay, my...
- My employer knows about... about your father's computer, and... and I have to take it to a secure location right now!
- Why? Why? What happened?
- (sighs)
- (beep)
- The signal is coming from a mile up the road.
- Okay, there's nothing to be alarmed about.
- It's just, the CIA had a breach of security, and your dad's computer could be involved.
- Oh, I should have known something like this would happen.
- I'm so sorry, Sarah. I...
- I was accessing a lot of weird stuff on that computer.
- Something about an Agent X and an Intersect program. I hid it in here.
- This isn't my bag. This is Devon's bag.
- He must have taken it by mistake.
- You know, it's okay. There is nothing to worry about.
- Nobody is in any danger.
- Okay.
- (woman screaming)
- (quiet murmuring)
- Man: Sarah Walker?
- Lock and load!
- ♪ ♪
- (women screaming and cheering)
- Um...
- Oh, okay, uh, I mean, do you mind if I make a phone call?
- All right. Oh.
- Okay. Um...
- I'm sorry.
- I don't mean to look at...
- I'm sorry. Okay, um...
- (clears her throat) General, I need you to put me in touch with our agents in Las Vegas, please.
- (cheering and screaming continue)
- Ooh, um, is that a g*n? No.
- This way.
- CHUCK (sighs): Oh.
- That's a... That's a pretty fantastic hike. Thanks.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- I'm glad those other dudes found some stuff to do.
- Vecas has got a lot for everyone.
- Ah... right in the ribs.
- Uh...
- Listen, since it's, uh, just the two of us, you mind if we talk, man-to-man?
- Sure.
- I know that you didn't take the hard drive out of my dad's computer.
- I'm sorry, Chuck.
- It just made Ellie so happy.
- I couldn't do it to her.
- I get it. I-I get that.
- And I'm happy that she's happy.
- And I'm happy that she's continuing my father's work.
- It's just that these secrets-- they're...
- I feel like they're tearing my family apart.
- Down, down.
- k*ll that light.
- Ah!
- Devon, why would you bring that to my bachelor party?
- Oh, no. I must have grabbed Ellie's bag.
- Man: Ah.
- This is the device Miss Volkoff wants.
- It has all the Agent X files.
- Vivian Volkoff.
- Casey, we cannot let her access the information on that computer.
- Riley: Sweep the woods.
- Leave no witnesses.
- JEFF (laughing): Hey!
- You guys here for the bachelor party?
- Ooh...
- Awesome brought entertainment.
- Do you like this?
- 'Cause I got three more where that came from.
- Huh! Ooh!
- Who's this Vivian Volkoff?
- It's a long story.
- Actually, it's pretty easy. I mean, it's Chuck's nemesis.
- He put her old man behind bars, she sent an assassin to blow up Castle.
- What about Agent X?
- I think I might be Agent X.
- Chuck, I am so sorry that I let Ellie touch your dad's computer.
- Chuck, I'm so sorry I let this guy plan your bachelor party.
- This is so awful.
- Oh, yeah.
- (laughing)
- (laughing): Ooh!
- Let's get this party started!
- (laughs)
- (whispering): My sentiments exactly.
- (blipping)
- The CIA cracked the encryption.
- I'll upload the files to Miss Volkoff.
- Yeah, but first, find out how much he knows.
- If he doesn't talk, see that he never talks again.
- Welcome back.
- You know why I'm here, don't you?
- Is it because I've been a bad boy?
- (laughs)
- What's in the sh**t?
- Sodium pentathol-- truth serum.
- Freaky.
- I don't think that'll mix with what I'm on.
- (laughs)
- (Jeff guffawing)
- Guys-- Jeff-- they're torturing him.
- Lester and Big Mike can wander in at any second.
- We got to do something.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Casey, what's the plan?
- (grunting)
- Who was that? Mercenaries.
- Ex-Green Berets, judging by their tactics.
- I count three, including the leader in camp.
- Guys, did you see that clean break?
- Maybe I can save him.
- No, he's dead, and so are we, unless you three tighten up.
- What's this?
- You and Morgan are gonna find some good strong sticks and start sharpening.
- Morgan: Yes, sir.
- Perfect. Sharpening what?
- Toothpicks. Ah.
- Spears, you idiot.
- I'll draw the rest of the team out into the woods.
- I'm sorry. You want us to fight former Green Berets with spears?
- Not you. You're gonna go down to the camp and spring Jeff.
- Happy hunting, boys.
- Happy hunting?
- Big Mike: Looking. Looking. Looking.
- I'm showing the nearest casino's in Las Vegas, Nevada.
- Did you say Las Vecas?
- I Well, no. We have to stay local.
- There's got to be a nightclub or a bar or... a liquor store or... ?
- Vegas! Vegas, Vegas, Vegas.
- Are you saying Vecas... ?
- Don't play with me, boy.
- We are getting the hell out of here.
- This is not what I signed up for.
- Wait. No!
- We can't just leave them. They may die out there.
- Take the drama down a notch.
- I only care about Jeff.
- (sighs)
- Ooh!
- What? What is it?
- A splinter, I think.
- Let me take a look.
- Oh, please. Listen to me. There are men trying to k*ll us.
- I can handle a little splinter, all right?
- I mean... Ooh, it... it hurts!
- (grunts)
- Morgan, you ever k*ll a man?
- I'll tell you something.
- The first one... the first one's the hardest.
- There's no doubt about it. Wow. Really?
- No, not really. They don't even give me a g*n on missions.
- Are you kidding me?
- (grunts)
- Captain: I'm a doctor.
- I took an oath to preserve lives.
- What about your own life?
- Dude, you heard Casey. It's them, or it's us.
- Captain: What if we met these guys at a bar?
- You know, we could be frat brothers, for all I know.
- Frat brothers-- these are mercenaries, dude.
- (silenced g*n) Drinks? Beers?
- (body thuds)
- You hear something?
- No. You're having first "mish" jitters.
- It's not my first "mish. " I think it's your first "mish. "
- How are those spears coming?
- You are lucky we didn't k*ll you with these spears!
- They are really sharp. I feel so bad for those mercenaries right about now-- zah!
- You ought to. They're dead.
- Dead? Well, what are these for?
- They kept you out of my way.
- Men, what's your status?
- Oh, poor baby. you're fresh out of friends. Looks like Well, in that case, I'm just gonna have to come out there and k*ll you myself.
- The captive's unconscious. k*ll him.
- (laughs) I see you've had kn*fe training.
- Let me give you one final lesson.
- (grunting)
- (grunting)
- It's over.
- (grunting)
- (grunts) (panting)
- It's over.
- (sighs)
- (whimpers, grunts)
- (body thuds)
- Sorry to interrupt your little lap dance.
- (gasps)
- (whimpers)
- (mutters)
- If anyone's still alive, meet me at the extraction point.
- What the hell's going on?
- Jeff's having a bad trip. We've got to get out of Vecas now.
- Good thing you boys came to your senses.
- Best bachelor party ever.
- Vecas, baby! Yeah.
- Hey, where have you been?
- Beckman sent a team to Vegas.
- They've been looking for you.
- Yeah, wrong Vegas.
- So where is Orion's laptop?
- Beckman thought that--
- She was right-- Vivian Volkoff sent a team for it.
- They tried to k*ll us.
- I've got to tell Ellie what she got herself into.
- If I didn't grab the wrong bag, you girls would have been ambushed.
- I agree-- Ellie deserves to know.
- I'll tell her.
- I feel responsible that the CIA used her to find Agent X.
- No, I'll tell her.
- But then you'll have to tell her the truth about you.
- I know.
- What are you doing home?
- Uh, I had to cut the bachelor party short.
- There-There's something that's been on my mind.
- What is it?
- (sighs)
- We've always been able to tell each other anything, right?
- Lately I felt like...
- Like there's something in the way.
- Yes, exactly, our family is so full of secrets.
- Too many secrets.
- I mean, our parents alone...
- Yeah, and, and, d d I don't think there should be any secrets between the two of us.
- I've been working on something secret.
- I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want you to worry and...
- I know about Dad's laptop and his research-- Mom told me.
- So why are we here? (chuckles)
- You're still a spy.
- Wait, w-w-wait, wait, wait a second, I had a whole speech and you just figured that out.
- You can't figure that out by yourself.
- I think I just did.
- You just Rubik's Cubed me, sis.
- Of course you still work for the CIA.
- Sarah's a spy, you're clearly built for better things than the Buy More.
- (quiet laugh)
- You're not mad?
- I'm not mad that you did it.
- I'm mad that you didn't tell me.
- I mean, I get it-- it's the same reason that I kept Dad's computer a secret from you.
- (sighs)
- Us Bartowskis-- when we're good at something, we just jump right in, don't we?
- No more secrets, though.
- One more little secret.
- Wow, look at this place.
- What are you guys guarding down here that's so important?
- Uh, well... me.
- El, you know that Intersect project that Dad was working on?
- Yeah, I've been trying to figure it out for weeks.
- It's in my head.
- What?
- No...
- Uh, Morgan, Katana sword, please.
- Oh, yes, yes, Katana, all right.
- Uh, full speed or half speed?
- Full speed, thank you.
- Okay, okay.
- Banzai... !
- (grunting)
- (speaking Japanese): (speaks Japanese)
- Sleeveless.
- It's a bit '80s, but I like this look.
- Pretty cool, right?
- (sighs)
- Our dad was amazing.
- He did it.
- He actually figured out a way to program the human brain using...
- What happened?
- I was going to use this to find Agent X.
- Ellie, you found him.
- You're looking at the first human Intersect-- it's me.
- No, not unless he gave it to you before you were born.
- November 21, 1980.
- What, there was an Intersect before Chuck?
- From what I can piece together from his files, Dad used this program to input a new identity into an operative.
- So Agent X could go undercover.
- But once he went undercover, something went wrong.
- The program took over.
- He became his cover identity.
- Dad must have felt responsible for it and that's why he spent his whole life looking for him.
- Not that that's going to happen now.
- Ellie, I haven't spent ten years in the Nerd Herd for nothing.
- Morgan, get my tools.
- Yes, sir, of course.
- What tools?
- For fixing computers.
- Tools for fixing computers, coming up.
- Well, I might as well get started on this inventory.
- Somehow my cover story became the truth.
- Hold on a second.
- Let me ask you two a question.
- Who am I?
- You're Big Mike.
- No, I'm Rain... of Earth, Wind, Fire, and Rain.
- And Rain does not waste a free party pass.
- Neither does Thunder.
- Is that name taken?
- Okay, wait, wait-- are we going to go to the real Vegas? No.
- Well, then... Me and the boys had a standing engagement in a city that makes Vegas look like the Vatican.
- What is this mythical place?
- Go get my Corolla.
- We're going to The Big Dirty-- Reno.
- Got it. (sighs)
- Okay, here, uh, here are the files.
- Dad must have collected everything there was on Agent X, for what it's worth.
- Casey: His whole file's been redacted.
- Except for a name-Hartley.
- He did leave something else.
- I have no idea what it means or if it's some sort of clue.
- (gasps)
- I know where that is.
- What, how?
- The Intersect-- that's incredible.
- Yeah.
- (gasps)
- Ellie, look at that date.
- It's a week before Agent X went missing.
- Do you think maybe he took the photo as a keepsake before his final mission?
- This place must be special for him.
- Maybe it's his home.
- Or some kind of safe house.
- Sarah: You think Agent X has been hiding out there for 30 years?
- Hmm.
- What's going on?
- Uh, well, Ellie, we're not the only ones trying to find Agent X.
- The people who put that hole in Dad's laptop-- they're after him, too.
- Well, I'm coming with you.
- What, are you crazy?
- No, two words: Baby Clara.
- What about you?
- Don't worry about it.
- It's what I do.
- (kisses)
- Place hasn't change in 30 years.
- Looks like somebody's still living there.
- If this Agent X guy has been hiding from the CIA all these years, he might not take too well to being found.
- WOMAN (British accent): Oh, hello.
- May I help you?
- (weak laugh)
- Uh, so sorry to disturb you, ma'am, but our car has just broken down, and I was looking in the, in the boot-- the bonnet.
- (in British accent): Uh, long story short we're stranded.
- Could we please use your phone?
- Oh, of course, come in.
- I'll make some tea while you wait for the lorry.
- Thank you.
- That way.
- (in British accent): Cheers, lovely.
- What's taking her so long?
- Will you relax, Casey?
- You don't think she's Agent X, do you?
- I don't know who the hell she is.
- That old bird could be poisoning our tea as we speak.
- Woman: Here we are.
- Nice cup of tea.
- Now, get it while it's hot.
- And this one is for you.
- Thank you.
- Delicious, thank you.
- So where are you all from?
- Um, not far from here, actually.
- I was just showing my fiancé a bit of the countryside before the wedding.
- He's American, of course.
- Hmm.
- And this handsome young man?
- Chuck: He is-is a hitchhiker we picked up on the edge of town.
- Yeah, he had such a nice face, we figured, what the hell?
- Uh, I was just telling my fiancé that my father had a friend who lived here, actually.
- In this house?
- Oh, how interesting.
- Yes, I believe his name was Hartley.
- Any relation to you?
- Oh, no, I'm just an old spinster.
- But I do know the man you're referring to.
- He was the previous tenant.
- A bit of a recluse, judging by the way he left the place.
- Oh, do you know what happened to him?
- No, I'm afraid not.
- (clears throat) Thank you for the tea.
- Maybe we should go and wait for the tow truck.
- But he did leave behind a box of personal effects.
- Oh, I'd forgotten all about it.
- I mean, it has been 30 years.
- Oh, well, I'd hate to bother you.
- No, you're welcome to it-- well, if your fiancé would kindly give me a hand.
- I believe it's a bit heavy.
- I would love to.
- Oh, wait here while I grab a torch.
- Oh, delightful.
- Okay.
- (clears throat)
- (r*fle cocks)
- Woman: Tell me who you are, and what you want with my son-- before you make me go ruin my wallpaper.
- Please, please, ma'am, I'm-I'm here to help your son.
- I'm here to help Hartley. I'm with the CIA.
- So, you're saying you work for the people who took my son?
- Give me your sidearm.
- Ma'am, I actually don't carry a g*n.
- Hartley should never have been sent undercover.
- He was a scientist.
- When the CIA couldn't bring him in, they disavowed him.
- No one lifted a finger!
- They did, they did! My father, he spent his entire career trying to find Hartley.
- You're Stephen Bartowski's boy?
- You knew my dad?
- Of course.
- He and Hartley were quite close.
- (gasps)
- Are you gonna fix my son?
- This is the place.
- Looks like someone b*at us to it.
- Move out.
- Not bad.
- (g*n)
- (g*n continues)
- Great. We're g*n and outmanned.
- What are you waiting for, laddie?
- Lay down some fire.
- Who are these people?
- Mercenaries.
- Must have followed us. They're not after you.
- They're after the same thing you came for.
- Hartley's spy will.
- (g*n continues)
- Oh. Here.
- There's a vault in the cellar.
- You'll find the spy will down there.
- Go! We can handle this!
- Oh, put down that damn sh**t.
- There's a real g*n in the chest.
- There.
- I prepared for something like this.
- You know how to feed one of these things?
- Please! You're feeding me.
- Where would you put a spy will?
- (g*n continues)
- There go my primroses!
- Eat lead, you bastards!
- Bingo.
- We're out. Now what?
- We'll have to scuttle the house.
- (whispers): Go! Go!
- Go!
- You're like the mother I never had.
- Oh, and charming to boot.
- Come on, let's go find your team, so we can get out the back door.

- What's that over yonder?
- Boys, we're here.
- (sighs with relief)
- Let's make it snow!
- Remember, boys, the joker's worth 13.
- Are we waiting for a code from the CIA to open it or something?
- I was just waiting to open it with you.
- Ellie: So the identity of Agent X is inside that box.
- Our dad's obsession.
- The whole reason that our family fell apart.
- (beeping)
- (whirring)
- Wha... ?
- Volkoff?
- Chuck: Agent X is Alexei Volkoff?
- Ellie: I know this man.
- Mom brought him to the house for Thanksgiving.
- He's a spy right?
- No, not exactly.
- Sarah: He's locked up now, but Alexei Volkoff is a very powerful, very evil arms dealer.
- Yeah, but he wasn't. I mean, that's the thing.
- Volkoff was a cover identity.
- In reality, he was just a scientist who didn't like using g*n.
- So Dad's original Intersect created one of the world's most dangerous criminals for the CIA?
- We should talk to Mom.
- Chuck: Maybe she was trying to fix him, too, you know, in her own way.
- We need to call Beckman, see what our next step is.
- No.
- We tell no one.
- Interrogation room. Now.
- It ends here.
- We're all gonna pretend we never saw this.
- John, my dad clearly wanted Chuck and me to figure this out.
- There must be a reason. Look, the CIA created one of the most m*rder men in the history of the world.
- There's powerful people who spent an enormous amount of energy covering that up.
- You know what happens if they find out we know?
- They order a guy like me to put a b*llet in each one of our heads.
- I'm pretty sure your dad didn't want this to end that way.
- Ellie: So we're supposed to just sweep this thing under the rug?
- Ellie, we're talking about the CIA.
- There are rules. What about Dad?
- What about Dad? What if his plan was just to get us to search together?
- Chuck: You know? We haven't exactly been the most honest siblings the past couple of years.
- ♪ ♪
- No, we haven't.
- But this search... it made us rely on each other.
- Be honest, work together.
- What if that was only half of it?
- I-I don't think that we're supposed to stop here, Chuck.
- I don't think that we're supposed to just find Agent X.
- We're supposed to fix him.
- (sighs)
- This isn't for the CIA to solve, Chuck.
- I think this is for us.
