# Chuck Versus the First Fight

- Chuck: Here's a few things you need to know.
- I'm the magnet for bad guys? Are you kidding me?
- I cannot believe you would use me as a human target.
- Casey: Everything about Bartowski's mother's life is a fake.
- Should've grabbed her before she dropped off the map.
- Mom left a message. She wants to see Ellie before she goes back undercover.
- No, no, let her go.
- Stop, stop. You have no idea what's going on.
- Your mom isn't the spy you think she is.
- Ellie, I'm sorry, but Mom is not coming.
- Why does she keep doing this to us?
- Because she's a spy.
- Beckman: Colonel Casey.
- The Project !sis file you discovered was authentic.
- Mary Bartowski, alias Frost... was a CIA agent working undercover for Volkoff... until 20 years ago when she turned and we never heard from her again.
- Agent Walker, you made the right decision by bringing in Frost.
- Agent Walker?
- Walker.
- Oh, uh, yes, general. What's the next step?
- We're moving Frost to a black site facility tomorrow.
- That means no one is to see her. Especially Bartowski.
- Agent Walker, I suspect I can trust you to keep an eye on Chuck.
- Of course, yes.
- Good. How is he handling all of this?
- Uh, he...
- He's fine, general.
- Calm, actually. Very calm.
- Calm? How am I supposed to stay calm? Sarah, I had everything under control.
- My mom was gonna meet Ellie and then disappear forever.
- I asked you to trust me. You went behind my back.
- Why is it so hard for you to believe in me?
- How was that?
- You were certainly passionate, but I wouldn't use the F-word.
- I didn't.
- No?
- No.
- It seemed that way. You were intense.
- Didn't Sarah have proof your mom was working with Volkoff?
- Whose side are you on?
- Do I have to pick a side?
- Yeah.
- Then you.
- Or no. I don't know.
- Sarah and I have never really had a fight before.
- Not a real one, not like this.
- I hear you.
- All right.
- A couple's first fight sets the tone for all future arguments.
- Trust me. I'm going through it, myself.
- You and Alex?
- No, me and Casey, actually. Yeah.
- So I'm just, you know, taking some time, cool off, clear the old mechanism.
- You should do the same thing with Sarah.
- You're right, it's certainly not getting me closer to proving my mom's innocence.
- My dad spent his whole life searching for her.
- Nothing here can help us prove she's not a traitor.
- [WHISTLES]
- You're telling me. This technology is ancient.
- But maybe if we clean it up a little bit and sell it on eBay.
- Are you joking? Nobody's gonna buy a Phalanx XR-12 computer.
- I mean, the thing only takes triangle-shaped disks.
- Whoa. Hmm. This is everything, huh?
- What do you mean?
- Your father left this stuff for you.
- Is there a possibility he might have left something for Ellie?
- Ellie: What do you mean, "left something"?
- I don't know.
- Information, uh, something about Mom, maybe.
- You know, Dad used to send me those coded messages in the Classifieds.
- But I haven't found anything since before he passed away.
- What is this about, Chuck?
- I guess it's just all this stuff with Mom.
- I was hoping that Dad had left us answers.
- I wish that we knew both of them better.
- But since the only person who can give us answers... is locked away in a CIA base...
- It's not like you can just waltz in there and ask her.
- Right, no. Yeah, I can't.
- Tom, Jerry. Good to see you guys again.
- Keep up the good work.
- Just keep doing what you're doing. Have fun with it.
- Hey, Ginger.
- Wow, Casey, a lot of new faces down here, huh.
- Hmm.
- Huh.
- We should have a mixer or something, a little get-to-know-you.
- We can exchange fake names and backgrounds.
- Okay, great. Good times.
- Chuck?
- Sneaking into your own... ? Aah!
- Uh, Morgan, how long have you been hiding behind that door?
- An uncomfortably long time, but that's not the point.
- The point is this: You and Chuck are in a relationship crisis.
- Crisis? Did he say something to you?
- Yeah, actually, he told me everything.
- And I think he just needs some time to cool off.
- He always wants to talk about anything.
- What do you want me to say here?
- You did go have his mother arrested...
- I was trying to protect him.
- Ellie said the same thing.
- He told Ellie too?
- Contrary to belief, there is a heart of gold underneath this cold exterior.
- Morgan, don't touch my chest.
- I meant that non-sexual.
- This is ridiculous. Neither of us should be sneaking around at all.
- If I could talk to Chuck, everything would be okay. Where is he?
- [SIGHS]
- You shouldn't be here.
- I need your help.
- Why? CIA thinks I'm a traitor.
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna prove you're innocent.
- If I'm gonna help you, I need the truth this time, okay?
- Casey found a file that said Project !sis was abandoned 20 years ago... and you betrayed the CIA and joined forces with Volkoff.
- Yes, that much is true.
- What?
- Twenty years ago, Volkoff had started to suspect I was working with the CIA.
- He was one step away from discovering my real identity.
- That you're a Bartowski?
- That I was a mother.
- So I did the only thing I could, I admitted I was CIA... and I told Volkoff I wanted join him.
- I broke all ties with the agency and I went to work for Ml6.
- Tell me who to call and I will fix all of this.
- No, it's not that simple.
- Volkoff has sources at the CIA, that's why I had to leave.
- A 20-year mission will be wasted if he gets wind of any of this.
- But you can trust me.
- You're not gonna tell your girlfriend?
- That's not gonna be too hard... considering we're in a fight and not really on speaking terms.
- Do you wanna talk about it or... ?
- No, that's okay, thank you.
- You'd think that being boyfriend and girlfriend she could trust me...
- It doesn't matter. I can keep it a secret.
- Good.
- There is one person at Ml6 who can confirm... that everything I'm telling you is true.
- His name is Gregory Tuttle, he's my handler.
- We have a preset meeting for today at 2:00 at the Old Duke Tavern.
- Go there, and give him this code: "Per fas et nefas. "
- "Per fas et nefas. "
- Okay.
- Okay.
- It's the only way he'll know he can trust you.
- And, Chuck, he doesn't know that you're my son.
- Nobody does.
- Okay, I got it.
- I'm sorry, the code one more time?
- Babe, what is all this? What are you doing?
- This sounds crazy, but what if Dad did leave me a message in the Classifieds?
- I thought you decided months ago there was nothing here.
- But I just found out that my mom was a spy... and Chuck said something today.
- This can't be just a coincidence.
- Look, every day since he's passed away, there has been an ad for a '68 Mustang.
- If there was a hidden code, you would've found it by now.
- I don't know. There's something about it.
- Could it be my dad's last message to me, something important?
- Hey. Ahem.
- Yes?
- Because I... I value our relationship, John, I need to be frank with you.
- We are in a fight.
- Okay.
- "Okay"? That's all you have to say to me?
- My shift ended two minutes ago.
- You lied to me.
- You never told me the Project !sis file... had proof that Mrs. Bartowski was working for Volkoff.
- You asked me to shadow you to make me a better spy.
- How am I supposed to do that if I'm always the magnet... or having to wait in a van or being lied to by my partner... and friend?
- [GRUNTS]
- Hey. Hey, Morgan. I'm so glad I found you.
- I need your help on a super top-secret mission.
- Do I get to parachute out of a plane on a wild horse?
- No, you do not, because nobody ever does.
- But you do get to wear an earpiece.
- Sold. Ha, ha. Yeah.
- Morgan, buddy, remember we're undercover.
- A little subtlety goes a long way.
- Ahem. Copy that, Chuck.
- Oh, Charles.
- Okay, so earpiece is in place and I believe it is working.
- Yes, hello? Hello? Check.
- Stop touching it.
- You're drawing attention to the fact that you're wearing it, okay?
- You are to be my eyes and ears on this. I need you to sit at the bar, unnoticed.
- Tuttle can't know that anyone came with me, ready?
- Break.
- MORGAN [OVER RADIO]: Do me a favor.
- Uh, can you make out the board with the specials?
- We're undercover. We're not here to order food.
- These earpieces are not for personal conversations.
- Remind me to tell you what Sarah thought of your fight.
- Sarah? You talked to Sarah? What did Sarah say?
- Whoa, whoa. What are you so nervous about? I did all the talking.
- Kept it simple and explained to her that by not believing in you... she betrayed your trust and your family.
- Your words, not mine.
- Morgan... Morgan, why would you... ?
- That was supposed to stay between us.
- [EARPIECE SQUEAKING]
- Yeah, okay, one second. But hold... Ow, ow, ow.
- Sorry, hold on one second. This thing is not working right.
- [BLOWS AND MUMBLES]
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- One second, Chuck.
- Oh, my goodness.
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- Cheers.
- Just one... I just have to...
- [MORGAN SIGHS]
- I hate to make a scene, but I'll rip your throat out... with this plastic fork if you don't tell me who you are... and why you're wearing an earpiece.
- That certainly would be a scene, wouldn't it? Aah!
- Wait, wait, wait. Ha, ha, you're Tuttle. You're Tuttle, right?
- You're Tuttle and I have a code word for you. It's Latin.
- And it's...
- What is it?
- Morgan: Just great.
- Now I need to dry this out.
- [HAND DRYER WHIRRING]
- [HAND DRYER POWERS DOWN]
- [MOUTHING] Oh, man.
- I got it, I got it.
- Per fas et nefas.
- Oh, thank God. Frost sent you.
- I'd like to apologize for questioning you in such a harsh tone... and, of course, for threatening to rip out your throat.
- I wouldn't even know how to do that.
- You seemed very convincing to me.
- Oh, that's kind of you, but I'm just a handler for Ml6.
- I'm not a trained field agent. You know, field-ready as they say.
- Okay, time's up now, Hawk. There's a limit.
- All right, let's go, dry it off. Polyester, so it's really absorbent.
- Good? Okay, thank you.
- Come again.
- Wait, why did Frost send you?
- Where is she?
- My name is Charles Carmichael. I'm her ally at the CIA.
- They have her in custody right now.
- If she's in custody, then Volkoff will be looking for her.
- We don't have much time.
- He'll start with whoever she was last seen with.
- Oh, please don't tell me it was you.
- [DART WHIZZES THEN GROANS]
- Bloody hell.
- [GRUNTS]
- Morgan, help.
- Testing, testing. Chuck, I'm back.
- I'm now back in business, buddy. Let's just...
- No. No, no, no. What... ?
- What?
- Gotta be kidding me.
- I lost him.
- Hello, Agent Carmichael. May I call you Charles?
- Sure, yeah, that's fine. Are we on a plane?
- Yes.
- Been kidnapped by Volkoff's operatives.
- Nasty buggers. They must think we've got Frost.
- What are you looking at?
- Not that scar, or that scar.
- Neither one of those scars.
- Or your... Or your mole. Mole.
- That is a beauty mark.
- Which is what I meant by...
- By mole, beauty mark. "Tomato, " tomato.
- Ha, ha, you're so stunning, I can't even look away.
- You're going to tell me what you've done with Frost... and you're going to do it now.
- He doesn't know anything.
- And you do?
- I know that if you use those tweezers... on those rather large hairs in your nostrils... it would work wonders.
- I mean, when was the last time a man expressed interest in you?
- Hmm? Be honest.
- What are you doing?
- Torture 101, I've read every manual on the subject.
- Weaken the enemy emotionally, then take the power.
- Plus, what could she do with those tweezers... ?
- No, no, no. Please stop, stop, stop.
- I'll tell you everything.
- Don't.
- My address is 17 Talley Place, my dog's name is Kipper... and I had my first sexual experience watching Lawrence of Arabia.
- I'm not proud of it, I...
- I came from a broken home.
- All I want to know is what you've done with Frost.
- You are going to regret that.
- I think I already do.
- Look, I don't know anything, all right?
- Chuck was there and then he was just gone.
- We just did what Mrs. Bartowski told us to do.
- I don't understand why he keeps trusting her.
- She just hurts him.
- Not anymore.
- She's gonna tell us what we wanna know.
- Morgan: Yeah, just let me... Let me...
- Uh-uh.
- That's why we keep you in the van. You stay here.
- I should try one last thing from the manuals.
- Please don't.
- [GROANS]
- The Swedish slip. It actually worked.
- And I didn't have to break my thumbs.
- What do we do now?
- Oh, cool. A tiny w*apon stand-off.
- En garde.
- [GRUNTING AND GROANING]
- Oh, hello there.
- [GROWLING]
- Please! A little help here or anything?
- Here, catch.
- [BREATHING HEAVILY]
- [GASPS]
- Enough. You're gonna tell us where Chuck is now.
- I wanna see my daughter.
- Casey: We're not having a discussion.
- Chuck came here this morning because he trusted you and now he's gone.
- If he's with my handler, I know he's safe.
- Sarah: Right, then why hasn't he called in?
- Perhaps he doesn't want to see you.
- Chuck told me about the fight.
- Okay, listen, I can't protect your son if I don't know where he is.
- I am trying to protect him too... which is why I am not saying a word to either of you.
- The only one I know I can trust is my son.
- [DOOR SLIDES OPEN]
- Mrs. Bartowski?
- Morgan Grimes?
- [GROWLS]
- I haven't seen you since you were 9 years old.
- I haven't had a decent Rice Krispie treat since.
- What are you doing here?
- Kind of a long story... but the thing is it's a little bit my fault that Chuck's gone.
- So if you could tell me where he is... l'll make sure that they give you what you want.
- I promise you, you will get to see Ellie, but you have to tell us.
- You can trust me, Mrs. B.
- [SIGHS]
- If you take me to see Ellie, I will tell you where Chuck is.
- We can't get in the cockpit. You find any parachutes?
- I found one.
- Oh, Charles, girlfriend's moving.
- We gotta find another parachute.
- There isn't one. I've looked.
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm just taking the piss out of you. Of course there's another parachute.
- Come on, who ever heard of a plane only carrying one parachute?
- [BREATHING HEAVILY]
- There we go.
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's just so thrilling.
- Right, it reminds me of that great episode of Alias.
- I loved that show.
- You ready?
- Yeah, as ready as I'll ever be.
- Let's do something fantastic.
- [SCREAMING]
- [SCREAMING]
- [BAAING]
- [SIGHS]
- What... ?
- Oh, Charles, you're up.
- How did we get here?
- It was exciting until you knocked yourself unconscious when we landed.
- Luckily, I was able to get us into this sheep truck.
- Well done, well done. Where are we, uh, going?
- This lot are going to the lamb-chop factory... so don't say anything about mint sauce.
- Oh, it's all right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- We are going to the City of Angels to get the intel that will clear Frost.
- That's great news.
- Now, I hope you don't mind me asking... but why are you so intent on helping Frost?
- I mean, you're not giving her one, are you?
- Giving her one... ? Oh, giving... ?
- Giving her one? No, no, no.
- I would never give her one. Simply, just no, no.
- We have, uh, a very professional relationship.
- You know, um, plus I have a girlfriend anyway.
- Good for you.
- Yeah, yeah, good. Yeah, good.
- Normally, usually it's good.
- It must be really hard being a field agent and having a relationship.
- Especially when she's a spy too.
- Well, that would bring in a whole host of complications.
- We're in the middle of our first fight.
- I don't need to, please.
- Chuck: I don't mind talking about it. It all began a few years ago...
- She knows you're coming.
- No.
- [KNOCKING ON DOOR]
- Come in.
- Eleanor.
- I'm sorry, Ellie. I have to stay.
- That's okay. I understand.
- Lemonade?
- That would be lovely, thank you.
- I'm sorry you have to see me like this.
- Things are complicated right now, but I wanted to see you... just you and me.
- I don't know what I'm doing with these coasters. I don't...
- I don't even use coasters, I don't...
- It's okay.
- [SIGHS]
- You're all grown up.
- I mean, I know that's obvious... but when I think of you, I still see a gangly little girl... too tall for her age, unsure how she fits into her own skin.
- Your dad and I... used to take you for drives in his g*n '68 Mustang.
- You would sit between us... with your legs curled up. Do you remember?
- [CHUCKLES]
- I can't believe I forgot.
- I remember, uh...
- Ha, ha, I remember those blue leather seats.
- Oh, your dad special-ordered those blue leather seats.
- Watching you sleep in between us on those long drives... was one of my favorite things.
- I just wanna know what happened. I wanna know the truth.
- [SIGHS]
- I guess it all begins with a scientist.
- His code name was Orion.
- But his real name was Stephen Bartowski.
- I wish that telling you that I did this all for you and Chuck made a difference.
- But I know it doesn't.
- And...
- Casey: Sorry.
- We have to go.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- You kept your end of the bargain, I'll keep mine.
- I know you don't think I care for my family. I do.
- If your Ml6 handler actually exists, tell him to bring Chuck here.
- There's a relay station that I call into.
- If my handler has posted his location, I can take you there.
- Once he sees me, he'll know he can trust you.
- Make the call. Let's go.
- All the intel we need to prove Frost is an Ml6 agent... is in a series of disks in that safety-deposit box.
- Sir?
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- [DEPOSIT BOX BEEPING]
- There it is.
- Babe, are you okay?
- I got home as soon as I could. How'd everything go?
- She said something when we were talking.
- She told me a story about an old car that my dad used to have.
- A 1968 convertible Mustang.
- With blue leather seats.
- This isn't a code, Devon, this is a real car.
- My dad must have left this for me. Let's get it.
- Ha-ha-ha. Quickly.
- Sarah: Chuck.
- What are you doing here? Beckman gave you orders...
- I thought you were in trouble.
- Oh, Agent Frost. Glad you're okay.
- Tuttle, you have the disks.
- Yeah, we're halfway there.
- These will prove that I'm not a traitor.
- Yes, but there's a little problem.
- Um, these disks can only be played on a special computer.
- Ml6 has got one in London.
- Wait a minute, no, no, no.
- These disks are for a Phalanx XR-12 computer.
- We don't have to go to London, I know of one here in L.A.
- Well, then what are we waiting for? Let's go.
- Frost isn't going anywhere, Beckman's orders, I'm taking her back.
- No, no, Sarah, you can't. We're so close.
- MAN 1: Nobody move. Everybody on the ground now.
- MAN 2: You heard him, get on the ground.
- You gotta be kidding me. A robbery?
- They're not bank robbers, Charles.
- It's Volkoff's men.
- And that indestructible woman.
- Please. Nobody here wants to be a hero.
- Just take the money, take whatever you want.
- Just don't take our lives.
- Keep your pants on.
- You're not my type. You're not who I'm looking for, anyway.
- How did Volkoff's men find us?
- Somebody must have led them here.
- Don't just accuse her.
- No, he's right.
- They must've followed Charles and me. Let him explain, really.
- It will make the fight you're having like nothing.
- Just like a blip on the radar.
- Is there anybody you haven't told about our fight?
- Well...
- Oh, they got them surrounded in there, Casey. What are we gonna do?
- If we go in through the roof, we can surprise Volkoff's men.
- Sweet. Give them hell, sir.
- You coming?
- I figured you wanted me to stay in the van, you know?
- You're never gonna learn anything if you stay in here, hmm. Let's go.
- Yes, sir. I forgive you too, Casey.
- Can't believe you've talked to everybody about our fight except for me. Let's go.
- [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
- I was just waiting until I calmed down a little bit, okay?
- It's our first real fight as a couple.
- Everyone knows that sets the tone for future fights.
- You're gonna set the precedent... by telling everybody what you're thinking before me?
- See, that just makes it sound bad.
- Go. All right, come on, come on.
- You might as well have posted about our fight on Friendster.
- People stopped using Friendster five years ago.
- Okay, you know what I'm talking about.
- You only met him and he knows everything about us.
- How do you know that you can trust him?
- Oh, I forgot. You can't believe in anyone unless Beckman tells you to.
- Oh, that is not fair.
- That is not fair? You wait a second.
- No, what's not fair is what you did.
- You could've told me before you arrested her.
- And watch you commit treason and go to prison?
- Kids, you need to stop this now. We need to do something.
- You're not doing anything.
- I'll stay. I'm just a handler.
- Yeah, he's just a handler.
- Okay.
- Okay, in 10 seconds we're gonna go over the counter.
- I'll take the big guy, you take the small guy.
- I'm capable of handling a big guy too.
- Fine.
- Fine.
- Fine.
- Fine.
- [SIGHS]
- [GASPS]
- Ready.
- [ALL GRUNTING]
- This is exhausting.
- Tell me about it.
- How do you always fight these big guys all the time?
- No, I mean, fighting with you is exhausting.
- I hate it.
- Me too.
- I've been thinking about you all day.
- [SHOUTS]
- I'm just trying to protect you from getting hurt.
- Behind you.
- I don't need you to protect me.
- I need you to believe in me.
- I do believe in you.
- I mean, really believe in me.
- Even when you think I'm wrong.
- Two field agents in action.
- What a show.
- [g*n COCKS]
- No!
- Chuck: Tuttle!
- [GRUNTS]
- Oh, my God.
- No.
- [GROANING]
- [BREATHING HEAVILY]
- I'm so sorry, Charles.
- It's up to you now.
- No, no, no. Tuttle, we're not leaving you here.
- Casey.
- We've got a man down, where are you?
- I'll be okay.
- Get those disks to the computer and finish it, Charles.
- For Frost.
- Casey is on his way. You're gonna be in safe hands, okay?
- We need to go now.
- What are you saying?
- What about orders?
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- If you trust her... then that's gonna be enough for me.
- You're gonna be just fine.
- Let's go to Orion's base.
- I guess I always assumed your father sold the house.
- How long has this been under here?
- I... I really don't know, I only found out about it after he...
- It's his life's work, Mom.
- The computer's right here.
- You're welcome.
- Just, uh, another day in the life of a public defender.
- Casey: Nobody move, freeze.
- Oh, no! Please, I have children.
- Here, take the keys to the vault. My car key's on there too.
- I drive a very nice Camry.
- Shut up, I'm a federal officer.
- [COUGHS]
- And I'm with him. Ahem.
- Look into the roof. I saw a piece on asbestos.
- Dangerous stuff. You got it everywhere...
- Grimes, Grimes, muzzle.
- Right, shutting up.
- I'm looking for an injured agent.
- Where did he go?
- Yeah, he's right over...
- There.
- This doesn't make sense. This has to be some misunderstanding.
- The Ml6 files are supposed to be on here.
- Mom?
- Stay here.
- Sa... Sarah? Where'd you go?
- Mary: Chuck.
- Your father never wanted you to see this.
- See what?
- But I know now he was wrong.
- [CHUCK GRUNTS]
- [SIGHS]
- Chuck, get down.
- What did you... ?
- Sarah: Aah!
- Tuttle?
- How are you here? You were... You were sh*t.
- What are you doing here?
- There is no Tuttle, Charles.
- My name is Alexei Volkoff.
- I believe you were looking for me.
- Chuck: What are you... ?
- Why are you doing this?
- It's really pathetic.
- Orion spent his whole life searching for a woman... who didn't want to be found.
- The wife he wanted so much to believe in... was exactly what she appeared to be: A traitor.
- You told him about...
- About my husband?
- Of course.
- And that he meant nothing to her.
- You know, Charles... it is shocking how Orion was able to convince you to follow in his footsteps.
- What was he to you?
- Your mentor?
- He was a good man.
- He was a fool.
- Just like you, Charles.
- If you'd just let it alone... none of this ruse would've been necessary.
- But you couldn't let it go.
- I had my reasons.
- I'm sure you did.
- Frost here is a master of deception.
- But she wasn't able to fool your girlfriend, was she?
- And you.
- When you locked up Frost, it became clear I had to step in... to find Orion's little base here and destroy all his intelligence.
- Along with all the people... who know about it, of course.
- [b*mb TICKING]
- Thank you for leading us here, Charles.
- I couldn't have done it without you.
- I believed in you.
- Oh, don't take it personally.
- There's no point in going to the grave with regrets, is there?
- Frost?
- Mary: Ready.
- Protect him.
- Shall we finish this?
- Apologies.
- It really was a pleasure getting to know you.
- You were right about her the whole time.
- I couldn't see it, I didn't...
- I didn't wanna see it.
- Flash. Come on, flash.
- Sarah, my mom did something to me with that device.
- Chuck, your mom gave us a way out.
- She might be working for Volkoff, but she certainly has a reason... for not wanting us to die right now. Come on, hurry. Let's go.
- What about my father's work?
- No, we don't have time. Let's go.
- Chuck?
- Ahem.
- Chuck, are you okay?
- Sarah.
- Sarah, I can't... I can't flash.
- The Intersect is gone.
- And now all of my father's research, everything he ever created... it's all gone.
- Devon: He said it'd be outside waiting for us.
- It really is my dad's car.
- I can't believe it's been here this whole time.
- Babe, it's beautiful.
- Stephen: Eleanor, if you're reading this then it means I'm not with you anymore.
- And I know you'll be okay.
- I only wish that I could've been the father you deserved... but our family had a lot of secrets.
- Secrets I kept from you because you were so young.
- Because I didn't wanna hurt you.
- I know you're a grown woman now.
- But no matter what... you'll always be my little girl... curled up on the middle seat of this car.
- This is my final gift to you, Eleanor.
- And I'm giving it to you now for a reason.
- I trust you'll know what to do.
- I love you always. Dad.
