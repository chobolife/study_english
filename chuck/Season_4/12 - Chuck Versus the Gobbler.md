# Chuck Versus the Gobbler

- Hi. I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know:
- I will do anything in my power to help bring back Chuck's mother and to eliminate Volkoff and his organization.
- Agent: Agent Sarah Walker, you're under arrest. What? !
- It was all a setup to establish my cover as a double agent.
- I'm going undercover into Volkoff Industries.
- I'm going to take them down from the inside.
- That's exactly how I lost my mom.
- That's exactly how you're going to get her back, Chuck.
- I'm doing this for you, okay?
- I'm doing it for us.
- (groans quietly, panting)
- That all you got?
- Sorry.
- Hey, you seen Bartowski?
- (gruffly): That depends on who's askin'.
- Sorry, I was just sort of workshopping a tough guy voice.
- I need some more work. Huh.
- Any-who, uh, I have not seen Chuck. What's up?
- Well, Walker's been all over Europe, taking jobs as a rogue agent.
- Volkoff's finally noticing.
- Want to make sure Chuck's in the loop.
- That's great news.
- But seeing as how Chuck is not here, do you have a second to have a little chitchat with me, man-to-man?
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, but...
- Listen...
- Sarah going to be undercover in Volkoff Industries for a long, long time. and I think that Chuck will be hurting inside...
- Ah, the feelings. I see why you came to me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa-- seriously, these situations tend to send Chuck, well, to the dark side.
- He'll wind up sitting around the house moping and sulking, and eating Cheetos, and... watching The View.
- Anyways, I need your help in sort of, I don't know, keeping Chuck's spirits up.
- Maybe we could tranq him till Walker gets back.
- Huh! Here's Mr. Mopes now.
- ♪ ♪
- Morning, fellas! Hey.
- You two are looking very dapper this a. m.
- How's my crew? Crew. Well, you're chipper today.
- Yeah, well... I just heard the news about Sarah.
- I mean, it's only been a few weeks and she's well on her way to taking down Volkoff and freeing my mom, so... what's not to be happy about?
- Abso-toot-ly!
- We were just talking about the same thing!
- We're thrilled and very happy, and you're happy-- happy, happy, Chuck.
- He's happy.
- I see. I get it.
- I-I see what is going on here.
- You're afraid I'm just going to sit around the house eating Fritos all day because Sarah's gone.
- I thought it might be Cheetos, but, uh, yeah.
- L-Look guys, I-I get it.
- I-- and I appreciate your concern, I really do, but I've thought a lot about this.
- When my mom disappeared into the Volkoff organization, her mission changed her.
- She became a different person.
- But that's never going to happen with Sarah.
- Mm. Yes.
- She'll always remain the exact same Sarah Walker.
- ♪ ♪
- (doors thud shut)
- Sarah Walker.
- Love what you've done with the hair.
- Please, sit.
- I hear you've turned against the CIA.
- Treason, was it? It was.
- Hmm.
- Bit out of character.
- Years ago, I told Chuck that I didn't want him to be a spy.
- I tried to get him to run away with me.
- But despite all your pleadings, he said, "no. "
- He did.
- I knew it.
- But I still loved him.
- We got trapped in a CIA-run world with no way out; no exit.
- Unless...
- There's always an "unless. "
- Unless I took matters into my own hands.
- I turned on the CIA because I want to cash out and build a life.
- It may sound foolish, but I'm trying to... buy a future with the man that I love.
- You know, I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic myself. art of massage, that sort of stuff.
- So... what do you want?
- I want to come and work with you.
- Ms. Walker... even if you've told me the truth about your motives, why would I ever trust you?
- Fair question.
- The reason you're going to trust me is because I'm not going to k\*ll you, right here and right now.
- You... are such fun.
- Thank you.
- (with Russian accent): "Velcome" to Volkoff Industries.

- Yes, let's.
- Sarah Walker, a traitor.
- This I had to see with my own two eyes.
- Well, it shouldn't come as a total surprise.
- After all, your actions did serve as a... sort of inspiration.
- Alexei, may I have a word in private?
- She's going to betray you; you know that.
- It depends how you define betrayal.
- Now, remember your intentions when you first met me?
- Now you're my right hand.
- Have dinner with me. (whispers): Alexei!
- Lunch, breakfast, uh, a bit of cake with a cup of coffee.
- Alexei, stay focused.
- You know I get great pleasure from bending people to my will.
- I do.
- Volkoff: She could be very useful to us.
- What if we had her break Yuri out of prison?
- That is a wicked idea.
- Thank you.
- Sarah, we're going to have you break out Yuri the Gobbler.
- Now, don't ask why he's called that.
- (snickering): It's because he eats people.
- Basically, it's a su1c1de mission.
- I love a good su1c1de mission.
- So do I.
- (phone playing a series of tones)
- Morgan!
- Dude, come here. Listen to this.
- (hums cheerfully)
- (series of tones playing)
- Pretty amazing, right?
- Dude, it's all sorts of amazing. Where do I start?
- Are you putting Kahlua in your cereal again?
- Buddy-- the beeps-- that's Sarah.
- What? She can't use voice communication when she's undercover, so the CIA developed a tonal language for us, that only we understand.
- Get out of here.
- And right now, she's... she's saying she loves me.
- Or she's planning on buying a Buick, I can't really tell.
- It's a very confusing language; lot of nuances.
- It's beeps and things, it's... I can understand.
- Alex: Morgan! Can I borrow your T-shirt? But of course.
- I gather things are going well with Alex?
- So well. This girl... is the coolest girl I've ever dated-- and I've dated almost...
- Chuck: Three? Three.
- Morgan: Three? No.
- Three. Three. Hey, Chuck.
- Don't freak out. Stay calm.
- But your girlfriend is currently wearing your previously unworn, original issue, Zemeckis authenticated Back to the Future T-shirt.
- Oh, dear sweet goodness.
- Pizza, orange juice. Pizza, orange juice. What?
- (romantic opera music plays)
- (b\*mb exploding)
- (b\*mb exploding)
- Um...
- Come back to bed so we can cuddle for before I go to work Uh-huh. Absolutely.
- Totally.
- There's still time-- you can get in there and save that T-shirt.
- No. I'm cool.
- Excuse me?
- Nah, she looked... just... really cute in it, didn't she?
- Let me ask you a quick question.
- What the hell's wrong with me?
- Nothing's wrong with you, my friend-- but I have news for you, Morgan.
- I think you're in love.
- (whispers): What?
- Okay.
- I'm in love?
- I'm in love.
- Maybe you're right.
- Wow. Do I tell her?
- Well, that's... that's a... kind of big deal.
- Alex: Morgan!
- Are you coming?
- Let's finish this conversation at the Buy More.
- I have some more snuggling to do, and... no, I'm not embarrassed I just said that.
- Mary: Stop exactly where you are.
- There is one square meter of land on the entire compound that is never under surveillance, and we are currently standing on it.
- Mrs. Bartowski, I came here to help you take down Volkoff and get you the hell out of here.
- Which is why I want you to break free Yuri.
- He's Volkoff's most trusted bodyguard, but I think he has something to do the Hydra.
- Hydra?
- Volkoff's network.
- A database of w\*apon buyers, sellers-- his entire infrastructure.
- Early on, I realized that Hydra is more important than Volkoff himself.
- So how does the bodyguard fit in?
- I really don't know.
- But since Yuri was arrested, Volkoff's communications with his network have slowed to a stop.
- (whispering): We should go.
- Sarah, I need you to realize that going undercover in a place like this can require certain difficult choices.
- I'm well aware.
- You might find yourself becoming someone you no longer recognize.
- I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
- Oh, good, I was, uh, I was just coming over to see you.
- Really. About what?
- Well, I'm having a bit of an issue with Devon, and I was hoping that you could help. I told you I can't get him to stop cooking with no shirt on.
- It's not that.
- I keep proposing baby names, and he keeps sh\*\*ting 'em down, one after another.
- Nothing works.
- That's ridiculous. I'm sorry, El.
- It's just that naming the baby is the last planning that we have to do before I can just relax and focus on the birth.
- You know? Yeah.
- No, yeah, totally.
- W-W-What can I do to help?
- Well, I, I finally picked the perfect name and I don't want him to sh\*\*t it down.
- It's the most beautiful, unique, precious name for a girl.
- Well, don't keep me waiting.
- What is it? Tell me.
- Grunka?
- I can't believe she's going to name her Grunka.
- Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.
- We can't. You can't.
- Grunka isn't what you name your beautiful baby girl.
- It's what you name... these people.
- Ellie said she wants the name to be original.
- Right? Mm-hmm.
- I think I may know a way to stop this Grunka in its tracks.
- Hey.
- Saw Alex leaving your apartment this morning... wearing your shirt.
- Hmm, right, Alex.
- Uh, yeah, see, that's because, uh...
- (clears throat)
- ... she didn't have a shirt. Hmm?
- She-- well, what, what I was meaning to say is she couldn't, she couldn't find her shirt.
- It was pretty cold, so we wear lots of shirts, and it's like a shirt party, you know.
- (laughing nervously): It's kind of a...
- Please don't k\*ll me.
- Okay? (growls)
- I need you to know that I am a perfect gentleman with her, and honestly I, I really do care about her.
- (inhales deeply)
- That is all I wanted to know.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- (slapping) Ow.
- Hey, any word from Beckman about what's going on with Sarah?
- No, nothing yet. Still waiting for contact.
- Computer Voice (over P. A. ): Surveillance disabled.
- Whoever's in here, you're about to enter a world of hurt.
- Yeah, serious world of hurt.
- Hello, boys.
- (sighs)
- Honey.
- Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry for all the drama, but nobody can know that I'm here.
- I had to disable the surveillance.
- (sighs)
- Wow...
- Sarah, you look evocative.
- It's so great to see all of your faces, but I don't have much time before I have to leave.
- I'm being sent to Seabrook Supermax Prison and I need you to create a diversion for me.
- Sorry.
- Sorry, you just, you, you just, you look so different.
- (chuckles)
- You know, hair change.
- That's a big-- it's kind of a drastic...
- What do you, how do you, how do you do that?
- Is that a wash or a wig?
- Uh, right, I need you to create a diversion so that I can break out this man: Yuri Gobrienko, aka Yuri the Gobbler.
- Yikes, a big mother.
- Eh, big doesn't always mean bad.
- Here are some photographs of his v\*ctim.
- (groaning) Oh, that's not good.
- That's impressive. The Gobbler is Volkoff's main bodyguard, but your mom believes that he has some connection to Volkoff's database.
- Code name Hydra.
- (beeping)
- I have to rendezvous with Volkoff's men.
- Find a way into the prison.
- I'll meet you inside.
- Sarah, Sarah, wait, hey, I know you gotta go, but...
- I missed you, too, Chuck.
- Wow.
- I-- it's kind of, it's kind of like I'm cheating on you with you, right now.
- Good-bye.
- Call me on the secure line with the plan.
- Got it.
- See you in prison. (door closes)
- Guard: What do we got?
- Casey: Transfer from Gen Pop.
- The inmates are having rec time.
- Careful, it's been almost two days without a stabbing.
- We're due.
- Chuck: I was thinking maybe we should just postpone this mission just lo e enough for everyone here to get all the stabbings out of their systems.
- What do you say? Chuck, listen to me.
- That tattoo on your face belongs to the most ruthless gang in North America.
- Well, you just tap on this bad boy right here and... uh, it's instant respect.
- What have you done? Hmm?
- Just a little bit of a, of a smudge.
- Focus, guys-- timing's limited.
- We can only divert surveillance for a short period of time.
- Yeah, and then when you do, make sure you signal me as fast as possible so I can flash and neutralize the Gobbler.
- You just make sure he's out cold.
- He can't know Walker had any help getting him out of here.
- Yeah, yeah, no-- good, good, good.
- Good old-fashioned prison fight.
- I'm excited, you know?
- You take out the biggest and baddest dude in that place, and guess who's top dog.
- You are, all right?
- You look better without it-- tougher.
- All right, guys, listen up.
- New dude in here.
- Don't mean to interrupt your little game of Mah-jongg, but we got ourselves a real k\*ll here today.
- Yep.
- New guy here likes to fight other dudes.
- I would be very, very careful of this guy.
- k\*ll.
- This is the guy.
- This is the guy you don't want to mess with.
- All right, dangerous.
- Morgan, I think they get the point.
- They all look like they want to k\*ll me.
- Morgan: Well, you're welcome, okay.
- As you were, guys.
- Carry on.
- (clears throat)
- So... which one of you is Yuri the Gobbler?
- (indistinct chatter)
- Please, not so loud.
- What's going on here?
- What are you doing there?
- What's the eye thing all about?
- The last time I pointed at him, he did this.
- Swallowed 'em whole.
- CASEY (over earpiece): All right, Bartowski, Walker arrives in three minutes.
- Prepare to initiate the fight.
- Oh, boy.
- The surveillance room is just up here.
- So, listen, um, Alex, you know, uh, hypothetically, very hypothetically, how do you think that she would respond to, let's say, me saying "I love you"?
- Stupid thing to say. What if I actually mean it?
- No, the words are stupid.
- You love someone, you show 'em.
- Heck, I went to her apartment, built her a shelf yesterday.
- Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- You've never told your daughter that you love her?
- I mean, that just seems wrong.
- I didn't ask you what you think, did I?
- You can talk to me.
- I know a lot about love.
- (chuckles) Yeah, no, totally.
- Moving in on the Gobbler now.
- The closer you get, the bigger he gets.
- Okay, let's get this guard off the surveillance monitors. You ready?
- It's the only way, right?
- We gotta do what we gotta do.
- What's his name again?
- Steve. Oh, yeah, Steve.
- Hey.
- Who are you guys?
- You know, it goes against everything I believe in to interfere with a hard-working guard protecting American citizens, but this just has to be done.
- Happy birthday, Steve.
- I know it's a little late, but all the guards down in Gen Pop-- we wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
- Hey.
- You Yuri the Gobbler?
- What do you want?
- I want your seat.
- It looks comfortable.
- You try to make point, huh?
- Show everyone that you can, uh, take me out?
- Yeah, well, maybe I am and maybe I just want your chair.

- Hello. Beautiful friend.
- Eleanor. Uh, can I be of help?
- We were just talking about a new toaster oven.
- Toaster oven? More like bun in the oven.
- (all chuckling) Right.
- Sure.
- Any thoughts on names, or...
- Actually, we have. We're naming her Grunka.
- Grunka. Grunka.
- Wow.
- Wow. I lost my virginity to a girl named Grunka.
- Filthy, filthy lady.
- Hard to believe she was a grandmother.
- Oh...
- That's just gross, babe.
- She was gross.
- Sticks in the head.
- We should really rethink the name.
- Actually, I'm pretty happy with my choice.
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Were you guys talking about that famous Armenian serial k\*ll, Grunka Kassabian?
- What? Serial k\*ll?
- Yes. Yes, we were.
- Don't think I don't understand what you're doing here, Devon.
- I'm gonna go wait in the car.
- Mission accomplished.
- Grunka, huh? Love that name.
- I haven't even told you the name yet.
- Right. Ask first, then say my line.
- Sorry.
- Hi, um... uh, yeah.
- Uh, so what are you naming your baby?
- (sighs)
- Yuri.
- So good to see you.
- Mr. Volkoff.
- I love working with this man.
- We have a long and storied history.
- You know, when you were captured, I was at a complete loss.
- My safety compromised.
- The one and only agent with complete access to my Hydra database, under lock and key.
- I am sorry.
- Oh, don't apologize.
- (chuckles)
- I'm not angry.
- Just disappointed.
- Disappointed?
- Well, a little disappointed.
- No. Very disappointed.
- (sh\*t fires)
- (body thuds)
- (raspy chuckle)
- Sorry.
- I have a hard time with disappointment.
- Chuck: It feels weird, coming back from a mission without Sarah, doesn't it?
- A little bit.
- Could just be indigestion, though.
- We ate a lot of cake.
- You know, Sarah and I just, uh... kind of started this ritual.
- After a rough mission, we'd order a pizza and play a board game, just unwind, you know?
- I guess that's not gonna happen for a little while now, is it?
- Hey, did-did we record The View?
- Oh...
- sh\*\*t, I don't know if I... did that or not. But, you know, it's funny that you should mention the whole board game thing.
- 'Cause we were just talking about how we were itching to-to play a classic board game.
- Weren't we, Casey?
- We were.
- We were.
- So...
- Great!
- Alexei, what did you do?
- He's the only one who knew about Hydra.
- No, Yuri didn't know about Hydra.
- Yuri was Hydra.
- (squishing)
- (grunts)
- Oh...
- Just a moment.
- (squishing)
- (pop)
- Oh! Got it.
- (raspy laugh)
- I hired Yuri to carry this device on him at all times.
- It cost him an eyeball, but earned him an unparalleled place in my corporation.
- But Yuri got careless, got himself captured.
- So the Hydra device had to be extracted.
- So this is your database.
- Much more than just a database.
- This is how I communicate with my people.
- None of them knows each other.
- None of them are aware of what part they play in my puzzle.
- Hydra allows me to see everything.
- Hydra is the heart of Volkoff Industries.
- But, the fact that you're even seeing this proves that it has a flaw.
- Human error.
- Yuri's shortcomings made me realize what a risk the eye was.
- So you just destroyed the whole system?
- (laughing)
- Of course not.
- I just downloaded all the data to a more secure backup location.
- Good. No more complications.
- Now, good work, Sarah.
- But before I reward you, there is one small issue that we still have to take care of.
- Come.
- The jet's ready to depart.
- Actually, no.
- There are two issues.
- We've got a dead body on the floor.
- Phyllis, cleanup!
- World domination never gets old.
- Guys, thanks for keeping my spirits up.
- I really appreciate it.
- Yeah. Of course. If there's anything else you feel like talking about, feel free.
- You know I'm a good listener, and Casey's...
- Casey. Yeah, I get it.
- It's hard, you know. I wish I could bottle my feelings up and not be so vulnerable.
- Well, maybe you should tell that to your armies in Australia.
- You've got to be kidding me.
- (imitates expl\*si\*n)
- Okay.
- (cell phone beeps)
- Who is that? Is it Alex?
- 'Cause, uh, maybe if we're all in this sort of caring mood, you could send her a little text that says, "I love you. "
- You know, which would be nice for the both of you.
- It's Walker. She needs to meet.
- She didn't use the secure line?
- Well, okay. Fine Let's go, then.
- No, She said, "Come alone. "
- Volkoff must be in the vicinity.
- Ca-- No, no. Casey, forget that.
- She needs us. Bartowski, this is a delicate situation. Volkoff knows who you are.
- You stay put.
- Trouble comes up, I'll be in contact.
- When you broke the Gobbler out of prison, did you, by any chance, happen to run into this man?
- I was using him.
- He's still loyal to me, so why not take advantage of that?
- Good answer.
- Now, let's prove that it's true.
- I took the liberty of posing as you and summoning him here.
- All I want you to do is go up to the ninth floor, and k\*ll John Casey.
- Frost will go with you to make sure it all happens correctly.
- Oh! By the way!
- I'll be watching.
- So let's make it exciting.
- Have fun with it.
- How the hell am I supposed to make this look real?
- I don't know.
- But if you find a way, give him this.
- I will.
- Buy me some time if Volkoff comes up here.
- Buddy, I can't take it anymore.
- I got to figure out where Casey is meeting Sarah.
- Dude, I know you miss your girl, believe me, but Casey said that we had to stay put.
- No. No, Morgan.
- This is not about me missing her, okay?
- What if they're in danger? What if they need the Intersect?
- I'm going to Castle. Maybe I can hack into Casey's phone.
- Trident Tower, ninth floor.
- What?
- Trident Tower, ninth floor-- that's where they're going.
- I happen to be really good at the quick-look-at-your-phone when-you-get-a-text-but you-didn't-know-I-looked look.
- You're angry at me because I withheld information.
- I get it, but, dude, I... (door closes)
- I thought I did it for your own good.
- And, by the way, I didn't even... know that you were gone, so-so that's interesting.
- I'm just pretty much here talking to myself.
- My turn.
- (sighs)
- (gasps) What you doing, Walker? Hmm?
- (grunting)
- That a girl.
- (grunting)
- What are you doing?
- I'm supposed to k\*ll you.
- Volkoff is watching.
- Look. (grunts)
- (grunting)
- Good. Now follow my lead.
- (both grunting)
- Chuck: General, something's up.
- There are guards in front of the building.
- Casey was contacted off the secure line.
- I'll call you when I have eyes on him.
- (g\*n cocking)
- Chuck, you're just in time.
- Just in time for what?
- There's a particular moment when an agent makes the decision to stop pretending, and to take the leap to join the other side.
- It's a game-changing step.
- Your mother made it all those years ago.
- And now, if you'll come with me, we'll see if Sarah's going to make the same step.
- I think she will. Come on.
- (both grunting)
- I can't leave here without k\*ll you.
- How do we sell this?
- Duck. (gasps)
- Oh! I'll let you retrieve your w\*apon, you sh\*\*t me in the shoulder. (both grunt)
- I'm not going to sh\*\*t you.
- Look who I found!
- Chuck!
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I thought we had a truce, but I like a little rascal who doesn't always listen.
- Truce, huh?
- You have an interesting way of keeping your end of the bargain, Alexei.
- (both grunting)
- Okay, then.
- (grunts)
- Throw me out the window.
- What? !
- The window.
- (both grunt)
- Look, there's a little platform down there.
- It's only 40 feet.
- I've done 60, easy.
- (both grunt)
- I'll be fine, I promise. Okay. But you better be fine, or else I'll really k\*ll you.
- Okay.
- I'm here to find Casey. Where is he?
- I'll show you.
- When you get back to Castle, give this to Chuck.
- Huh?
- Okay?
- (both grunting)
- Quite a brawl.
- (both grunting, blows thudding)
- Chuck: Sarah?
- Volkoff: I notice your g\*n's gone missing.
- You want me to finish him?
- No.
- (panting)
- Volkoff: k\*ll him, Agent Walker.
- Is that all you got? Huh?
- (both grunt)
- No!
- No, Casey!
- No!
- (grunts)
- (groaning)

- (creaking)
- Whoa!
- (yelling)
- (gasps)
- It's done.
- Why... ?
- Why?
- Why?
- Don't you see, Charles?
- She did this all for you.
- (Sarah panting)
- Volkoff: Bit of paternal advice.
- You might want to give her a little bit of space.
- Taking a leap like this is painful for all involved.
- But congratulations.
- You're one step closer to the woman you love.
- Chuck...
- Chuck?
- You ready to go?
- (sighs)
- I'm ready.
- Good.
- Captain: I'm sorry.
- Maybe involving Chuck's cronies wasn't the best idea.
- Okay, it was the worst idea.
- Look, not having the baby named is making me a little anxious, and I understand if you don't like that name, but you haven't liked any name.
- What? ! I've liked names.
- Like what?
- Like, um...
- Like Clara.
- Well, I like Clara.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Clara.
- Is that her name?
- I mean, this is a huge decision.
- One that'll set her path the rest of her life.
- Devon, we are gonna have to make a million decisions like this.
- This is called being a parent.
- I know, but this is the first one.
- I think I've been stalling just because I want to get it right.
- Okay, I'll make it easy for you-- Clara or Grunka?
- Clara it is!
- (laughs)
- Little Clara Woodcomb.
- I can't believe you thought I was gonna name our baby Grunka.
- Grunka-- the name of the spoons that I bought at Ikea.
- I had you going there for a minute, though.
- Spoons? Mm-hmm.
- From Ikea? That's right.
