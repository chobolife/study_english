# Chuck Versus the Seduction Impossible

- that you might need to know.
- Hello... Diane. Hello, Roan.
- What's the deal with this Roan guy? He's a legend in the department.
- An incredible spy. Real old-school James Bond type.
- Congratulations.
- Awesome.
- Mary: Hello, angel.

- ♪ ♪
- I really wish you'd pick up.
- I need to hear your voice tonight.
- I'm sorry, again, that I couldn't make it, but...
- I'm thinking of you.
- Sweet dreams, and besos, my flower.
- I'm jealous.
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd like to be that drink.
- Mmm.
- Men must take one look at you and tell you all their secrets.
- Impress me.
- Here's one... ah.
- The new hundred dollar bill.
- Impossible to counterfeit, but...
- Someone did... perfectly.
- It's called a super note, and I'm in town to find out who made it.
- So you're a spy.
- Oh... That's very exciting...
- Roan Montgomery.
- Hello, Roan. (stammers)
- Naughty... naughty... Roan.
- (sizzling)
- (grunts)
- (thud)
- (women snickering)
- What a way to go.
- (laughing)
- (chattering) Ellie, I think she has your mouth...
- (fussing)
- Chuck: Oh! I'm out of here.
- Okay. Here's the sit-rep.
- It has been 23 minutes since Clara had a number one, 51 minutes since number two, and 76 minutes since her last feeding.
- Maybe she's hungry.
- Or maybe she needs a change.
- Hey, Sarah, could you get the diapers and wipes?
- Chuck, feeding pillow, stat!
- Okay. ELLIE: Mom, can you take her for a minute while I get settled?
- Yeah. Go to Grandma.
- Come to Grandma.
- (fussing stops)
- Mary: Yeah. That's my girl.
- Captain: Aw, Grandma's got the magic touch.
- Mary: Oh...
- Mary: Smooth and silent.
- Same technique I always used for moving live expl\*sives. (coos)
- Okay, I'll just edit that part out.
- (quietly) Wow.
- Babies are stressful.
- Tell me about it.
- You know, speaking of which... Alex... you know, there's something I want to... tell you... talk to you about...
- Hold on! Wow!
- It's all good... great. Alex isn't pregnant.
- No, no. She just... She wants me to meet her mom.
- Oh. Kathleen. Yeah.
- Kathleen. You know, and the thing is, I feel kind of uncomfortable starting off this relationship with her with this secret about my friend-slash- not-dead-ex-fiancée.
- Could you touch base with her, please, and tell her you're actually alive?
- Not a good idea. Mm-mm.
- You know, uh, Alex's having a tough time with this, you know?
- She's been lying to her mom this whole time, and, uh, she couldn't even talk to her when you were in a coma.
- You see? So...
- (sighs)
- I'll think about it. Yes! Thank you.
- Great! Perfect. You're the man!
- Could you do it kind of quick, though, you know?
- Because I just... I had this dinner planned on Friday...
- So, Chuck, Sarah, what are you guys thinking for the big day?
- Oh, it would be so great if Clara could walk down the aisle as your flower girl.
- You know, Woodcombs usually walk at six or seven months, so you really don't have to wait that long.
- What are your colors going to be? Oh...
- I'm a better gray than blue, just as a...
- I still have my veil, if you want to borrow it.
- I don't... I don't know that Sarah's a veil girl.
- Captain: Oh, my cousin is the raddest vegan caterer.
- You got to use him.
- Honey, the wedding cake he made Jim was beige.
- Captain: Well, you know what they say: something old, something new, something borrowed, something beige. (imitates buzzer) Wrong.
- It's not beige... Wow...
- (grumbling indistinctly) family... intense...
- I'm actually sweating.
- The last time I sweat, there was g\*n involved.
- Red? Don't use red. Red is back! Blue...
- (arguing indistinctly)
- What does that mean? He doesn't even eat cake!
- I hear you. We need a bad guy.
- So badly.
- Guys... we need a mission.

- Casey: Sorry to disturb you, General.
- No... (clears throat), not at all.
- General, we were just wondering if there was anything that you, or our country, needed, from us.
- Preferably far outside of America.
- Actually, I do have a mission, but it would be off the books.
- You would have no support, and it's extremely dangerous.
- We're in! We're in! In!
- Then your mission is to rescue and return one of our own: Agent Roan Montgomery.
- (screen bleeps) Roan Montgomery?
- You mean the seduction master himself?
- I love that guy.
- What happened? Was he captured?
- He was last seen in a café in Marrakech.
- Uh, General, given Agent Montgomery's... proclivities, is it possible that he perhaps took an elective trip off the...
- No. That is not what happened.
- We believe he was investigating local crime czarina Fatima Tazi.
- She is best known for her private merc army of female soldiers.
- Agent Montgomery, luckily, has a tracker on him.
- It shows that he is in Fatima's fortress in Marrakech.
- Locate him, and bring him safely back to the United States.
- Thank you.
- (screen bleeps)
- What is going on with the general? !
- She's a hot mess!
- Well, General Beckman and Roan Montgomery have a bit of a history.
- Their romance has been going on for decades.
- Historic events happen when those two are together.
- Berlin '89, Iraq '91...
- Florida 2000...
- Which is why we better go get him.
- (high heels clacking)
- Roan Montgomery.
- Did you ever think your storied life as a spy would come to an end because you picked up a girl in a bar?
- Well, actually, yes.
- That's precisely how I thought I'd go.
- But that's not what happened.
- Oh? Mm-mm. No, I'm exactly where I wanted to be: in front of the woman who's created the world's only flawless counterfeit bills.
- And meeting me was worth dying for?
- You're not going to k\*ll me.
- You're going to make me your head of distribution.
- (giggles) No, no, no. I'm not joking.
- My international contacts can help you launder your money so that people like me don't keep showing up at your door.
- And why would I do business with a CIA pig?
- (sniffs) Mmm.
- Because rolling around in the mud can be so much... fun.
- What?
- You always over-pack for missions.
- How am I supposed to know what kind of mission we're going on?
- It could be a sh\*\*ting mission; it could be a dancing mission.
- It could be a sh\*\*t, which I know isn't really a thing, but knowing our track record, is very much a possibility.
- Well, let's just save that for the honeymoon, shall we?
- So... your family.
- Sorry, sorry.
- They're a little intense about the wedding, huh?
- They're very sweet.
- But...
- But... ?
- I have a proposition for you.
- Okay.
- What if we eloped?
- I know that you want the big family wedding, but your family is going to be this intense until we get married, so... what if we-- just the two of us-- were to run away to some beautiful, romantic, amazing place?
- Then all of this stress and pressure could be avoided.
- Think about it.
- Is she trying to k\*ll me?
- I know. Elope?
- I can't elope.
- Of course you can't!
- Who's going to be the best man?
- I'll tell you who.
- Some weird, creepy cousin of some weird, old stranger you find to marry you.
- And then his weird, old wife who smells like Thousand Island dressing is going to stand up for Sarah.
- And then you're stuck with a bunch of weird, old, stinky strangers in your wedding photos.
- I just got my family back together, you know?
- I have a niece now.
- I want them to be in my wedding.
- But you know, marriage is about compromise, and this is what Sarah wants.
- But you giving Sarah what she wants and me not getting what I want is not, necessarily, "compromise. "
- The point is-- and I'm sorry to say this to you, buddy, because I know you've never been able to do this with a lady, ever-- but you're going to have to put your foot down.
- Just say no.
- No, huh?
- To Sarah?
- This is what I think you should do, okay?
- You start by saying no to something far less important, and then, you know, slowly work your way up.
- A practice "no. " Practice "no. "
- Interesting.

- Okay. Cut through and enter here.
- (laser sizzles) (clears throat) Chuck, do you need some water? Uh...
- You know what?
- No.
- Okay.
- Actually, yes. I'm kind of thirsty.
- Sure.
- Come on, let's go.
- Do you want pliers?
- Yeah.

- Wow, some fortress.
- Chuck: Yeah, well, looks like we need a costume change.
- Making me, once again, right to, as you say, "over-pack. "
- Sarah: By the way, for the record, I will not at any point during this mission be dressing as a belly dancer.
- What if you need to do it for our country?
- I'm sure America can handle it.
- By the way, if you're into the Moroccan thing, we could always elope here.
- Just think about it. Come on.
- Let's go. In here.
- Again, Casey, I can't apologize enough for that accidental touching in there.
- Just very a tight changing space. Yeah. Don't mention it.
- Looks like Roan is upstairs.
- Let's go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, super bad Saudi oil tycoon at 12:00.
- What do you think they're doing here?
- It's not our mission. Let's find Montgomery and figure out what's up. Come on.
- Well, according to the tracker, Roan is in that room, over there.
- After you, Casey.
- Okay.
- This could get fun.

- Shall we celebrate the little soiree I made for you downstairs?

- Ooh, two women.
- And a large man.
- Darling, you know I like it spicy, but I do think...
- Don't you mean "two large men"?
- You three? What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you. You're welcome.
- I don't need... rescuing.
- Unlike you, Colonel sh\*\*t 'Em Up, I can finesse my way out of any situation.
- And what situation would this be, exactly?
- (stammering)
- Listen, I don't have time to go into it, but I'm about to blow Fatima's counterfeiting ring wide open.
- Wait, you're on a mission?
- Yes.
- She's making super notes.
- Wait a minute. How'd you find...
- Who sent you?
- (clears throat)
- General Beckman.
- Gen...
- (groans)
- Diane's birthday present.
- The watch. It's got a tracking device in it?
- Well, you've got to leave.
- She's going to be here any second.
- We're going to, um... seal our partnership.
- Oh, look, look. She's coming. She's coming.
- You've got to hide.
- Just hide.
- Go, go. Here, go! Hide!
- How is my naughty little turncoat?
- Mmm! Ready to be your naughty little turn-on.
- Fatima: Mmm.
- You are very feisty, eh?
- (chuckling)
- Oh, feed me or b\*at me.
- I don't care. Just get in here.
- Hey.
- Hi. Oh.
- (both chuckling)
- So, everything's set up for Friday.
- You're going to meet my mom.
- (chuckles)
- Are you excited?
- What? I am so excited.
- Absotutely. You kidding me?
- Yeah, yeah. It's just that I have... a little surprise for you, as well.
- Really? Yeah.
- I talked to your father.
- And he agreed to get in touch with your mom.
- Let her know that he's okay, alive and well, and back in the picture.
- Isn't that great? Come on.
- What? Morgan, no.
- No, that is not great at all.
- I have been keeping my dad a secret from my mom on purpose, okay?
- To protect her, because for the first time in her life she's finally happy.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, bad initiative.
- I thought it would have made you happy.
- Okay, I'm sorry. I'll fix this, okay? I promise.
- You look a lot like your father right now.
- A cigar right now and a kn\*fe, and you would...
- FATIMA (giggling): You've been a very naughty, naughty little spy.
- Roan: Oh, you better teach me a a lesson, then.
- Fatima: Yes, I will. (chuckles)
- (whispers): Chuck, if you get us caught because you sneeze, we are officially the worst spies in the world.
- I know. Bad Three Stooges.
- I get it. And I, and I... and I won't.
- But man, it is dusty.
- We have to get out of here. (Fatima giggling)
- Let's just take Fatima out.
- We'll grab Roan and bail out the window.
- Okay, copy that.
- You good, Chuck?
- Um... no.
- No?
- Yeah, no. I-I said no because I think... I think Roan is making some good headway here and we should let him finish.
- (Fatima moans)
- The mission. Finish the mission.
- But...
- But nothing, okay? I said no... woman.
- Sometimes in a relationship people disagree about things and...
- See, see?
- Not the worst spies in the world.
- (Chuck sneezes)
- Guards!
- Betrayer!
- No, not betrayer, lover. Shut up!
- These are clearly your comrades.
- Take them all to the dungeon.
- (sighs)
- Baby... this is all a misunderstanding.
- It's me, Roan.
- Sit tight. I'll get you out.
- So, last I saw you two you were a young, exciting couple-- chasing, flirting.
- Now, the silent treatment.
- Sexy.
- If you must know, we are very much in love, happy, and soon to be married.
- We're just... having a bit of a disagreement right now, and the ball and chain isn't helping.
- Are you calling me a ball and chain?
- There's a ball and ch... there's an actual ball and chain here.
- Do you... Do you not see this on the ground attached to my leg?
- Ball and chain. Yes, thank you.
- What's with all the "no's" lately, anyway?
- I may have been a little obstinate before.
- Okay, let me guess. This is about something bigger.
- Performance issues.
- No! I am adequate. More than adequate in that depart... Right?
- You can't, you can't agree with me?
- I don't want to... Sarah, I don't want to elope.
- Okay? I just don't. Not at all.
- Not even in the slightest bit.
- I've always wanted a big family wedding, and now more than ever, so no.
- My answer to eloping is no.
- Okay, fine. I hear what you're saying.
- But why do you get to say no?
- What about what I want?
- (sighs)
- Okay, I've got eyeballs on the dungeon door, and there is a lady guard.
- I'm gonna seduce my way past her.
- Oh, no. Uh-oh.
- What? What's happening?
- Casey's gonna try and seduce the guard.
- No! What? The man who flunked my course at the farm twice? !
- Casey, that's not a very good idea.
- Don't you have a g\*n or some expl\*sives?
- Yeah, because you're terrible at seduction.
- You have no finesse!
- I heard that.
- Blowing the door will only alert the other guards.
- Now, this is exactly the type of girl I know how to charm.
- Oh, God, he's gonna charm her.
- Look, tranq and explode!
- Casey, tranq and explode!
- Evening.
- Stop!
- Well...
- That's a lovely w\*apon you have there.
- Go.
- Gosh, it must get awfully lonely down here in the dungeon by yourself, no one to talk to.
- Yes. Yes, it does.
- Cold, too.
- You can take it.
- You're hearty.
- I can see why they didn't assign one of those skinny ones down here.
- (groans)
- Don't tell me.
- (tranq dart fires)
- (device beeps)
- So you tranqed her and blew the door.
- How charming.
- I rescued you. Shut up.
- Okay, let's get out of here.
- I'm staying here. What? Why?
- I told Beckman about Montgomery's leads.
- I'm gonna get to the bottom of these super notes.
- Get him back to Burbank.
- Oh, yes, about that, I'm not going back to the States with you.
- Thanks, all the same. This has been a debacle.
- No, Roan, we need to take you back with us.
- Roan: No, thank you...
- (tranq dart fires)
- Really.
- Beckman said he might try that.
- Tell Morgan I'll be back in a week or two. See ya.
- Okay, well, mission accomplished. .
- Sarah and I will go upstairs and let you guys catch up.
- Sit... down!
- Sitting down, ma'am.
- Agent Montgomery, your mission to Morocco, who ordered you to go?
- Well...
- No one did!
- Fatima Tazi, the super notes?
- You went after them without any authorization, and now I have one of my best agents hidden inside a Moroccan fortress without backup!
- Be on standby.
- If Colonel Casey gets into trouble in Morocco, I am sending you in to get him out.
- Diane...
- General... if there's trouble, I'll get Casey out.

- I feel a chafing.
- The chafe of stylelessness.
- I hear you on that.
- Um, listen, Roan, I'm-I'm kind of going through my own spy relationship turmoil thing, situation here, and I was just-- I wanted to ask you about the general.

- Of course not.

- Level with us.
- These super notes really exist?
- It gives me great pleasure to announce that we have been able to produce more notes than originally anticipated, for a grand total of one trillion dollars.
- What are we going to do with one trillion dollars?
- That is too much currency.
- Our fortunes depend on a strong dollar.

- Stand by for further instructions.
- You're going to Morocco.
- We need the location of that mint so we can destroy it.
- Yeah, and even more than that, we've got to get to Casey before he chops his own arm off.
- General, how are we going to find the location of the mint?
- Fatima isn't going to tell us anything.
- Only one man could possibly get the information out of her.

- Ma'am, Fatima will have Roan sh\*t on sight.
- No man could seduce Fatima Tazi twice. It's a...
- Seduction impossible.
- Get him.
- General, I know that Roan has broken a promise or two, but you can't send the man to his own death.
- Get me Roan Montgomery!
- And that is the story of Sleeping Beauty.
- You know, Grandma once had to take a potion that made me sleep for a couple of days.
- But Grandma's partner had a potion, too.
- And when it was time to wake me up, he put the antidote on his lips and woke me with a kiss, just like the prince.
- Grandma was on a mission.
- Can you say "mission"?
- A seduction? No problem. But a rope climb?
- I am getting a little old for this.
- Okay, climb over. Get to the boudoir, and seduce the location of the mint out of Fatima. We'll get Casey.

- Hey, hey.
- One last thing.
- In case I don't see you two crazy kids again, do one thing for me.
- Remember you're in love.

- Please, don't call out for help.

- What are you doing here?
- Just hear me out, please.

- Well, okay, I mean, who am I gonna invite?
- Who's gonna come?
- Who's gonna walk me down the aisle?

- Casey, hey. Yes.
- Good. Sorry. We're right here.
- Darling, I know you're not after wealth.
- Your heart is far too pure for that.

- Why don't you tell me?
- Let me help you.
- When I was a girl, my village was destroyed by an American conglomerate.
- (laser crackling)
- They strip-mined over my entire world.
- (sighs)
- So I am going to flood the markets with one trillion U. S. dollars.
- The American economy will collapse, and it will be my little village that brought them down.
- Hmm.
- Yes, you told me about your village.
- It's called... Setouan.
- Is that right?
- Yes. You listened.
- Of course.
- I'd love to visit it someday.
- Hmm.
- I've got the village on my monitor.

- There's the mint.
- We got it!
- This is Beckman, authorization 8485-Charlie.
- Initiate air strike, sending grid coordinates now.
- Man: Air strike... Chuck, Sarah, get Casey out of there.
- We just need a minute.
- Uh, General, we're gonna be slightly delayed.
- Chuck, what's happening?
- Bad guys. Lots of bad guys.
- (soft grunt)
- Right behind you.
- Take one step to the left.
- The other left, idiot.
- Don't move!
- Never done this before.
- What? Never done what before?
- Woman: There are Americans in the palace.
- You... bastard!
- Yes, I answer to that.
- Woman: What do we do?
- k\*ll them.
- (woman gasps)
- (gasps)
- Well, that takes care of your friends.
- Casey, you are great!
- (coughing) Get me out of here!
- Right. Right.
- Now to deal with you, Roan.
- (phone ringing)
- So sorry.
- Oh. So rude.
- Hi. Could I call you right back? I'm right...
- Who is this?
- This is General Diane Beckman.
- With whom am I speaking?
- This is the woman who is about to k\*ll your agent.
- Good. It's about time.
- Good?
- She said, "Good. "
- We're in the middle of a tiff.
- I don't want to stop you.
- I'd just like to say one last thing to Roan.
- I'm happy to see him die.
- (laughing)
- Another one of your admirers.
- Hello. Diane, listen, I just want to say that I am truly sorry, but, you know, I can be such a bastard.
- Thank you, Roan.
- Oh, one more thing.
- Yes?
- Duck!
- ♪ ♪
- Beckman: Roan! Roan, are you there?
- Is he alive?
- We got him, General.
- He's right here. Oh...
- Are you okay?
- Oh.
- (sighs)
- I still got it.
- Yeah.
- Ah, where's the bar? Come on.
- Let's go. Let's get out of here.
- What's the hurry?
- Go, go, go. (Roan mutters)
- Here is to the woman who blows everyone else away.
- Seeing you in action again-- it was like old times.
- Old times?
- I like to say "the '80s. "
- Darling, listen, there's something...
- Mm. I know.
- You don't want to settle down.
- You're not made for that.
- You're a spy.
- That is your life.
- Almost like you rehearsed that.
- It was my speech to you.
- You changed your mind, too?
- Why did you hunt me down?
- Roan, you never run away from a general.
- ♪ ♪
- Yes, of course.
- But I do hope our rendezvous aren't over.
- Budapest last spring was divine.
- Well...
- I have high hopes for Morocco tonight.
- (laughs)
- (laughter and indistinct chatter)
- Good for you, Kath.
- Ellie: Mom.
- 30 more seconds, then we check the temp.
- Ellie: Mom?
- What is it?
- Having you here has been great.
- But you are ready to try it on your own.
- I get it.
- No. No, it's not that.
- I would keep you here forever, if I could.
- Mom, do you really want to be a full-time grandma?
- It's okay.
- This is what I dreamed of for so many years.
- I made Chuck quit the CIA, and sometimes I wonder if that was the right decision, because I know that he's a good person who's helped people, and he's protected us.
- He's a Bartowski.
- (soft laugh)
- And he says that you're the best.
- I can't keep another person from being a hero simply because I'm... afraid.
- If you need to be a spy, that's not another abandonment.
- You'll still be in our lives.
- I want to give everything to this baby that I never gave to you or Chuck.
- But that's my job.
- You just have to be the best grandma in the world.
- So... tell me about the agent who kissed you awake on the secret mission.
- Oh...
- He was a big romantic.
- And the greatest husband there ever was.
- Aha. (laughs)
- Well, I'm glad we talked.
- Me, too.
- I think eloping just seemed like a way for me to avoid my family.
- Sarah, you've done so much to help my family.
- How can I help yours?
- (sighs)
- I don't know. It's different.
- Sarah, come on.
- It's our job to take care of some of the world's biggest problems.
- t\*rrorists and despots and oligarchs.
- I mean, I think we can handle a family, even yours.
- Hey, hey.
- You are Sarah Walker, the most mysterious woman in the world, so as the future Mr. Sarah Walker, can't I get to know you better?
