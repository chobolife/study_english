# Chuck Versus the C.A.T. Squad

- Man: They say it's a personality thing, but to me, a martini's got gin, not vodka.
- Some folks like chocolate.
- I'll take vanilla.
- I say baseball over football.
- And to me, man's best friend doesn't bark or fetch a ball.
- See, personally, I like cats.
- Meet my Clandestine Attack Team.
- Better known as the CAT Squad.
- Me-ow.
- They were the best spy team in the business.
- The year... 2003.
- The girls...
- Cold-hearted Carina.
- (grunting)
- Zondra, the bitch!
- (grunting)
- Amy... the party girl.
- (grunting)
- (grunts)
- And... (grunting)
- ... my pride and joy...
- Sarah Walker.
- (wind whips)
- (g\*n)
- Go get 'em, Cats!
- (women meowing, cat yowling)
- Hmm.
- Chuck: Buddy, hey?
- You still with me? Yeah. Yeah. No. I just...
- Your description of the CAT Squad has sent me into fantasy land.
- I don't even want to think about what goes on there, but according to the CIA database, the CAT Squad was bad ass.
- I just still hope they're tight, because I'm running dry trying to find Sarah's old friends for our engagement party.
- Really? Um... here's a crazy notion.
- Ask Sarah.
- Well, yeah, uh, not-not such a wild notion.
- It's just, she's being very reluctant to help.
- You know, she-she's got a very complicated relationship with her family, she's lost touch with her friends, but I know she'd want someone there, you know, so I'm nudging, being a good fiancé.
- I'm trying to help fix things.
- Got it. Good.
- Good for you. Where do I come in?
- Well, uh, Carina was one of the Cats.
- Carina, Carina?
- So I need her info.
- Chuck. Carina? Really?
- I mean, Alex is gonna be there.
- Alex, Carina. Carina, Alex.
- Two of my lovers in the same place?
- The universe may just collapse on itself.
- Dude, give me the info.
- Oh, fine. I don't even know if I have it anymore. I mean... (scoffs)
- Here's her phone and e-mail and Facebook alias.
- We're friends. Restricted.
- I can't post on her wall or view pictures.
- Go-Go easy on her. Break this whole Alex thing to her gently.
- Carina's a-a delicate girl.
- (grunting, yelling)
- (grunting continues)
- (cell phone ringtone)
- (panting)
- Walker in a white dress?
- Please. But the Cats...
- Interesting.
- What?
- My old spy partner's getting hitched.
- Her fiancé wants to get the old team back together.
- Nice.
- (grunts)
- (panting)
- Woman: Hello?
- Amy, Walker's getting married.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Stop screaming. How do we find Zondra?
- Ellie: Hi, Sarah.
- Hey. Heading out?
- Yes, to the in-laws.
- Devon's packing up the car.
- We're doing a little overnight for the grandparents.
- But we'll be back with plenty of time for your party.
- How's the invite list coming?
- Done... I thought.
- I told Chuck that I didn't really have anyone to invite, but he has this big idea now that he wants to discuss with me. Oh, boy.
- Yeah. I'm really excited for the party, but digging into the past... old friends and family... it's, um...
- It's a bit complicated for me.
- And Chuck just dives right in.
- Head first.
- Well, I could talk to him.
- No, I should probably try and get over the terror that I'm feeling right now.
- Sarah, if you ever need to talk about complicated family situations, wedding stuff, anything, you can come to me.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
- It does feel good to talk about it.
- Anyway, have fun.
- Well, not likely, but thank you.
- We having company?
- Oh, no, not we. You.
- Two words: CAT Squad.
- The CAT Squad.
- Wow. I, um... I didn't see that one coming.
- Well, you know, I thought it'd be fun.
- I mean, your old team.
- One could be a bridesmaid, or-or even the maid of honor.
- I haven't seen them in a very long time, and I've changed a lot.
- Look, I-I just think that we should have talked about this beforehand.
- This could open a Pandora's box.
- Really? How?
- Well, first of all... Carina?
- She was the mellow one.
- Oh. So, you were a little wild back in the day.
- Hey, hey, hey, Sarah.
- I get it. I do. I get it. You're nervous.
- I- I understand. I was terrified when I went searching for my mom, but look how that paid off.
- It's just, you don't really know what to expect with this team.
- (helicopter whirring) WOMAN (over bullhorn): Sarah Walker!
- Oh, no. Oh, no, what?
- (helicopter whirring)
- What's going on?
- Is it Close Encounters?
- Is this really happening?
- Woman: There's our girl!
- ♪♪
- It's my ex!
- Heard you were getting married.
- You know what that means.
- Girls' night out.
- I'm Chuck, by the way. Buckle up, girl. We're going for a ride.
- We'll have her back by 12:00.
- Midnight is very sensible!
- (laughs) Try noon tomorrow, lover boy.
- Maybe.
- Morgan: Hello, Carina.
- You look well.
- Morgan. Remember? Morgan?
- Something's different about you.
- I am trying a new cologne.
- That might be...
- Let's go. (whistles)
- I think she remembered me.
- Sarah was right.
- I honestly wasn't expecting that.

- Sarah?
- (groans)
- Head... hurts.
- You're very dressed up... for bed.
- Oh, we went to a club in Hollywood, and then another one in Vegas, and then an after-hours spot in Miami.
- Who knew that Mikhail Gorbachev could dance so well?
- I guess reconnecting wasn't such a bad idea after all, now, was it?
- It was okay. Okay?
- Well, okay is good. Okay is a start.
- Springboard. Oh, Chuck.
- Come on, you saw your friends, and you had fun.
- The band's back together again!
- No, the band is not back together again.
- Why?
- Look, some of us don't trust each other.
- Well, maybe you should just have a quiet coffee, you know, and some conversation.
- No, look.
- A while ago, we were on a long-term mission, and the target kept anticipating our next move.
- Something wasn't right in the team, so I swept our equipment for bugs, and I found a hidden transmitter in the heel of Zondra's boot.
- She denied it was hers, and she passed a lie detector test.
- And we shook on it and, uh, we decided to let it go, but it stirred some bad feelings.
- Well, honey, if the CIA cleared Zondra, then it's got to be some kind of misunderstanding.
- Right?
- Time can heal those.
- Margaritas don't hurt, either.
- Speaking of which, I'm working on a new recipe for the party.
- Engagement parties are not this squad's cup of tea.
- They're leaving when they wake up, by the way.
- The CAT Squad? They're here? Mm.
- Yeah.
- They were too tired to find a hotel room.
- (sighs) Sarah, where is Carina?
- (sighs)
- Hi.
- Good morning.
- (high-pitched gasp)
- What are you doing here? !
- Mm. There was nowhere else to go except the floor.
- But the floor can be fun, too.
- Hmm? What? No! Get... Stop!
- (grunts)
- That was sultry.
- You were just sultry right there.
- And are you na... ?
- Are you na... ?
- Are you hitting on me?
- Something is different about you.
- The confidence, straight spine.
- It can't be true, but you're behaving like you're having regular sexual intercourse.
- Huh.
- Martin, get back in this bed.
- No. No!
- All the times that I-I e-mailed you, snail mailed, texted, called out into the night... nothing.
- You completely ignored me.
- And now, I'm off the market, okay?
- So I would like you to leave.
- I have a lot of work to-to...
- (gasping)
- (gasping)
- Chuck? ! Chuck!
- That woman is an animal, okay?
- And I will be back when she's gone!
- This is ridiculous.
- (muttering)
- Well, that is a snazzy outfit.
- (laughs)
- Hey. Hi.
- What brings you by here?
- Breakfast.
- (sighs)
- You forgot. Here's the thing.
- I was helping Chuck surprise Sarah.
- Okay? She has some old work friends in town for this engagement party... just old hens... you know, and I just got caught up trying to help and be the good friend, and I'm sorry.
- Let's just reschedule. No. Two seconds, bam, I'm out of this whole fashion statement and I'm... and I'm gonna be ready to go, okay?
- I'll meet you back here... When are you starting the French toast?
- Chuck said you would... you know, none of us can cook.
- Oh. Hi.
- Um, I'm Carina. Okay.
- Carina, this is... this is Alex.
- This is my girlfriend.
- Beautiful girlfriend.
- And this is, um... one of Sarah's...
- Old hens.
- Right. (laughs) Well...
- It looks like you have been enlisted to cook.
- Yeah, as in now. We are starving.
- Oh, okay. Just...
- Easy, easy, back inside... you; off you go.
- (nervous chuckle)
- Draft'll be the... the death of you.
- She's just... whoa.
- I'm sorry, okay?
- You look beautiful, and I feel like a jerk.
- Lunch tomorrow, okay?
- Sure.
- (slow chuckle)
- And don't worry...
- Morgan, I trust you.
- Thank you.
- Well, and... I know your dad.
- And I trust you.
- Right.
- Now, that seemed like a threat.
- ♪♪
- So... I bet you Cats have some wild stories from your CAT Squad-ing days, huh?
- They're top secret.
- Are they? AMY: We could talk about our mission to Reykjavik.
- The sulfur baths?
- The floating massages.
- Don't you guys ever miss it?
- Running around together?
- I guess.
- Sometimes.
- But I also like working one on one.
- Hey, what's up?
- How are you? Anybody want some more bacon?
- Anything? Nothing?
- Zondra: Hey, remember Pyongyang? That dissident we broke out of jail?
- We did all those shots of snake's bl\*od afterwards.
- That was you and Sarah.
- You guys made an amazing team.
- I learned so much from you, had fun.
- I think about it a lot.
- I've b... I've been on a number of missions myself, actually, yeah.
- My first one, I had to disarm this expl\*sive device using Internet pornography.
- So... (laughs)
- Wow. (fake laugh)
- This Chuck, quite a catch.
- He's all right.
- He certainly is.
- Zondra: Okay, well, girls, it was good to see you.
- Sarah. Got to catch a flight.
- Me, too. You got room on your bike?
- Yeah. Guess I'd better go, too.
- Take me?
- Sure. Good.
- Chuck: The Cats certainly pack an attitude and Zondra is an acquired taste, but I do think it's good you reconnected.
- I'll miss you.
- Congratulations.
- I'm gonna miss all you guys. Text me.
- Yeah. Okay.
- Come on, girl, let's ride.
- It wasn't all bad, but I'm glad it's over.
- Zondra: Walker.
- Good luck with, uh... that.
- Keys.
- Chuck: Baby steps, right?
- And no more surprises.
- (alarm chirps)
- Carina!
- Sarah: Carina?
- Carina!
- Chuck: I'll call an ambulance.
- Please.
- Carina, your leg!
- It's part of the b\*mb.
- (groans, pants)
- Ladies, who's Augusto Gaez?
- Beckman: Augusto Gaez is the arch nemesis of the CAT Squad and leader of the Gentle Hand.
- The b\*mb fragments trace to his factory in Rio.
- He tracked you down, Cats.
- Excuse me, General... the Gentle Hand?
- Are these bad guys, or a massage parlor?
- Zondra: They're brutal k\*ll.
- t\*rrorists for hire.
- If you want your competition blown away, that's who you call. SARAH: We hunted the Gentle Hand for years, but we could never pin down Gaez.
- Every time we got close, he slipped away.
- Amy: He must have thought we reunited to come after him again.
- And tried to k\*ll you on American soil.
- Cats, the mission is in from Langley.
- Capture Gaez and extradite him back to the States for trial.
- General, I'm happy to hunt Gaez with Chuck and Casey, but...
- Langley said all available hands.
- Carina, due to your injury, you will monitor the mission and provide support from Castle.
- Chuck and Casey, you're shadowing the Cats.
- It's Carnival in Rio.
- Gaez will throw a big party... he does every year.
- It'll be heavily guarded, but I'm sure we can find our way in.
- I love it.
- General, we're not a team anymore.
- This comes from the top, Sarah.
- The Cats are back.
- So, hey, Rio!
- Sun, sand... that's... that's good, right?
- Chuck, you know that tracking device I found in Zondra's boot?
- We were on a mission to nail Augusto Gaez.
- Uh... come on, you think that Zondra's working for Gaez, that she planted the b\*mb?
- The government cleared her name.
- Yeah, we'll see.
- (phone ringing)
- Yes?
- Man: The CAT Squad is on their way to Rio.
- Excellent.
- The plan is going perfectly.
- We're going on a mission again!
- CAT Squad high-five!
- You guys are zero fun.
- Hey, Sarah.
- I have an idea.
- Look, Chuck, I know that you have good intentions, but can we please ease up on the ideas?
- This is a solid idea; hear me out.
- Look, I'm gonna be stuck in a van with Casey, which gives me plenty of time to review all the CIA files on both the CAT Squad and Gaez and run 'em through the old computer.
- If Zondra turns out to be a double agent, we take her down with Augusto.
- But if she turns out to be innocent, you guys can be friends again and-and reconnect in a real way... maybe I can help you fix this. Look, it doesn't really matter whether or not I have friends at my engagement party.
- I'm talking the big picture here.
- I'm talking you engaging with your past.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- I can just see that little hamster wheel turning in your head, Walker.
- All I'm thinking about is nailing Gaez.
- Hm. Well, you just make sure you keep your paws out of my boot heels.
- Oh, you want to start that again?
- Yes, I do.
- Hey, hey. Cool it, Cats.
- Hm?
- You rang, Casey?
- Is it hot in here, or is it me?
- Carina's assigned to Castle.
- Make sure she has I. T. support, food, whatever she needs.
- No, no, listen to me, I- I can't be alone here with that woman, okay? She... she wants me.
- Badly.
- John, she desires my physical person.
- And I'm hunting unicorns.
- You're baby-sitting. Get over it.
- I have intel on Gaez's Carnival party.
- He'll be at Cabaret Soco Na Garganta.
- Near the Sambadrome.
- The only question now is, how do we breach security?
- Disguise or commando entry?
- Guys? (laughs)
- Duh. It's a party.
- (loud, lively Brazilian music playing)
- How do Brazilian spies work with all this noise?
- Sarah: Casey, we're in the club.
- Do you have the signal?
- Camera's up.
- ♪♪
- No sign of Gaez.
- He won't show till later.
- I know his habits.
- I've been keeping tabs on The Hand, just in case.
- Convenient.
- We can cover more ground if we split up.
- Well, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with you on your own.
- I'm not sure I care.
- Huh. Good.
- This is a hornets' nest.
- Let's just do our job.
- ♪♪
- (sighs)
- Uh... you know, the CIA's gone over that a hundred times.
- The findings were inconclusive.
- Get over it. Look, eight years ago the Cats got yanked into a Gentle Hand mission in Milan, but Gaez escaped before the girls ever made it to Italy.
- Uh-huh. So I figured out that Gaez was tipped off from a CIA safe house inside Milan, so if I can prove that Zondra wasn't in said safe house, maybe Sarah will be able to trust her again.
- You know, I used to be like you.
- Wanted to fix everything.
- Not now.
- Example: Grimes suggested I approach Alex's mom.
- I was tempted at first, but... she's moved on.
- So...
- Didn't need her life disrupted, and...
- I let it lie.
- ♪♪
- I spotted Gaez.
- He's surrounded by muscle.
- ♪♪
- He's heading into the VIP room.
- We can get the layout from Chuck and Casey.
- I'm not here to discuss anything past your immediate needs, which have been met, so...
- I'm gone. (laughs)
- My needs have not been met.
- You're upset I never called you back.
- Look, I'm sorry. Get over it.
- Oh, I'm over it, sweetheart.
- Yeah, yeah. And I'm with someone.
- Some...
- Oh. The girl at the door.
- So, uh, you've told her you love her?
- Yeah, of... hey... (sputters)
- No. No. But I-I was going to, and then her father got thrown from the roof.
- I plan to do it, very, very soon, and I just... What are you... So it's not even serious.
- Huh? Look...
- (phone ringing)
- Excuse me.
- It's Alex.
- Oh, she's at the Buy More.
- Listen to me, I have to go.
- Uh-uh, you're staying.
- You don't like it, take it up with General Beckman.
- You got to be kidding me.
- S- So... you're at the Buy More and I'm not.
- Alex: N- No... you do not appear to be.
- Yeah, yeah, and I-I don't think that's gonna... change anytime soon.
- 'Cause I got shanghaied into... baby-sitting this injured agent.
- Oh.
- So you're, um... you're canceling on me again?
- You're needed. Ah!
- Now.
- Uh, one sec. One second.
- Would you please...
- Yeah. I'm afraid so.
- But I am going to make it up to you.
- Whatever you want. Dinner, movie... ?
- I owe you, so huge.
- Yes, you do owe me.
- I will be in touch.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
- (smooching)
- If you're done slobbering, Grimes, there is a problem in Rio.
- Um, can I asks you a question?
- Zondra: Is your insurance paid up?
- Ready? Yeah, I'm ready.
- I'm ready!
- Chuck, Casey.
- NSA monitored a call from Burbank to Augusto Gaez yesterday.
- Gaez knows the Cats are coming.
- It's a trap, guys. Abort now.
- Chuck: Sarah, you have to get out of there.
- It's been a long time, Cats.
- Drop your w\*apon, or die.
- All these years.
- Enemies, fighting each other.
- (clicking tongue)
- Such a waste, no?
- You're the bad guy, Augusto. That's how it works.
- Says who?
- Why can't we work together?
- That's why we're here?
- A sales pitch?
- The worldwide market for The Gentle Hand has blown wide open.
- GAEZ (over listening device): I need k\*ll operatives who can open a door with a fist.
- Or a smile.
- Kitty, kitty, kitties.
- You have been lured here to accept a career... with The Hand.
- Or I'll bury you on Mount Corcovado.
- Casey?
- They're tied up. Five guards, all armed.
- I'm going to use the Intersect to drop down and capture Gaez.
- Just going to drop down out of the sky, huh, hero?
- Don't you think you're overcompensating 'cause you got your girlfriend's car blown up?
- That is not true.
- You just sit tight, till I give you the signal.
- Remember, you only have a tranq g\*n.
- Sarah: A career in The Hand?
- With you and who else, Augusto?
- Because you've already got one of us, don't you?
- Do I, Sarah?
- Why don't you let her finish the sales pitch?
- Why don't you shut up?
- No, I would like the air cleared, once and for all.
- Sarah, let's just get out of this alive. No.
- Let her say my name.
- Offer me up, Walker.
- Accuse me out loud, instead of under your breath like you've been doing for years.
- Sarah: That's exactly what you've been doing to me, telling people that I put the tracker in your boot?
- (gasps)
- The suspense is a k\*ll, no?
- Maybe it's not tough Zondra.
- Maybe sweet Amy?
- Suspicious.
- But so is Sarah Walker, the kitty who doth protest too much.
- You know it's not me, and I've got no intention of joining up, So if you plan to k\*ll us, you may as well tell me the truth.
- I think that's fair.
- I'd rather just k\*ll you.
- Casey? Casey, this just got ugly.
- (grunts)
- You're done, Gaez.
- Now, do you want to live, or do you want to die?
- Keep cool.
- We are all... keeping cool.
- You're going to tell me exactly what I want to know or you're the one getting buried on Mount Corcovado.
- Okay.
- The name is... Yeah?
- Okay.
- Gaez: I'll tell you. I think... I think Sarah needs help.
- (screaming)
- (tranq darts sh\*\*ting)
- (tranq darts sh\*\*ting)
- Ha, ha! (man grunts)
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Damn it.
- I need immediate extraction.
- Any way you can. Plane, boat, car...
- How about fist?
- Casey: I've got Gaez. Let's get out of here.
- Wait. Wait.
- He was about to tell me the name of the mole.
- Now that he's in custody, he'll never talk.
- I was... I was just... I was... I was helping. I was helping.
- Look, look. Look, look, look at all the bad guys I tranq'd.
- I don't need help with my job, and I don't need help with my past, so stop trying to help me, okay?
- I don't need help!
- No, no, no!
- (groans)
- I deserved that.
- Excellent work in Rio, in spite of the hiccups.
- But, Sarah, you were right.
- There's a traitor in the Cats.
- Well, you know who my money's on. Personally, I always thought that Carina had a shifty look in her eye.
- Honestly, how well do you know Amy?
- I mean, is anyone really that perky?
- Conjecture and ill will do not make a case for treason. We need facts, and until we have them, I want the Cats to stay in Castle.
- Casey, interrogate Gaez for the mole.
- You're dismissed.
- I have a job for you.
- (door opens)
- MAN (over P. A. ): Attention, shoppers.
- The Buy More will be closing in five minutes.
- Hello, beautiful.
- Do I have the night of nights planned for you.
- First of all, we are...
- What? What?
- Lipstick on your collar?
- Oh, that dirty, little...
- Whose lipstick is it?
- The wounded agent?
- Miss French Toast?
- She obviously rubbed it in to sabotage our date.
- She has the soul of a bridge troll.
- I really want to believe you, Morgan, but you have been acting so strange.
- And three times in a row?
- That is asking a little too much.
- Okay. Oh, yes. Oh, but Alex.
- Alex? But... you trust me, remember?
- Do I?
- The Cats left their luggage at our apartment.
- There might be another tracking device in their things, and I don't want anything leading home.
- Great. Sounds like you're trying to get rid of me.
- Look, I know I screwed up, Sarah, but...
- Okay, fine. Fine, fine, fine.
- But look, I did some analysis on the Cats' failed mission to Milan, and it seems very suspect.
- It's not totally conclusive, but if we can figure out who actually was in Milan...
- You're still helping. Stop.
- Now.
- No. Sarah, but...
- Zondra: Hey, Walker.
- I'm not running anywhere.
- You know what? In fact, I am sick and tired of pussying around.
- So why don't we settle this old-school?
- Toe-to-toe?
- Yeah, let's do it.
- ♪♪
- (grunts)
- Still got that jab, Walker.
- Yeah? Mm-hmm.
- You want some more?
- Got some questions for you, Gaez.
- What is she here for?
- Muscle.
- I thought it might be fun. (laughing)
- Ouch.
- Shall we begin?
- (both grunting)
- I have never even heard of an organization called "The Gentle Hand. "
- I'm a businessman.
- Yeah. Business in terror.
- Built a fortune, k\*ll a lot of men.
- But that all ends now.
- (both grunting)
- I'm not the traitor.
- I didn't plant that tracker.
- Neither did I. Then where did it come from?
- Huh? You were the only one in Milan.
- I was never in Milan on that mission.
- I was supposed to be, but I got an anonymous call to stay put in Paris.
- We need to disc...
- You just gonna primp?
- (Casey gagging)
- (groans)
- One of us had to have been in Milan.
- Carina was in the U. S.
- I read it in Chuck's report.
- That leaves...
- Both: Amy.
- (Amy shouts)
- (both grunting)
- Traitor. Yeah.
- So what? I paid for it.
- Acting like the world's biggest dope.
- Wearing stupid sexed-up costumes to fight world crime.
- Now I have everything I ever dreamed of, except it is a little lonely.
- Join me.
- Go to hell.
- (Sarah grunts)
- I know where you live, Walker.
- You even think of trying to find us, remember, there's a target on your back.
- You, Chuck, the sister with the baby.
- Don't forget.
- (mutters indistinctly)
- Chuck?
- Can you think about making two trips?
- Not really my style.
- How's the reunion going?
- Doesn't everybody want their friends and family around them?
- I mean, wouldn't you have been disappointed if there hadn't been one friend or family member at your wedding?
- Yeah.
- But maybe Sarah sees the world differently.
- I just want to make her happy, and everything I did backfired.
- Chuck, you bend over backwards to help people.
- It's one of the reasons that you're so easy to love, but sometimes the best thing you can do is just take a step back.
- Be understanding.
- You don't have to fix everything.
- So I blew it?
- Big time.
- But I'm pretty sure she still loves you.
- Where is she? Okay, listen, I don't know what it's gonna take to get it through that thick spy skull of yours, but you need to understand something.
- You are not the only game in town, and I am in love with somebody else.
- You really are angry. You're damn right I am, okay, and I'm through with you, and I'm through being your slave.
- Wow. You're so worked up.
- I guess you really do love her, huh?
- You guess? You guess...
- You're supposed to be an intelligence officer, and you guess?
- Well, you haven't said it to her. I just figured.
- You figured wrong, all right?
- Although... I really should tell her.
- I do love her.
- Oh.
- Oh, shut up. I'm gonna go get her back.
- (computer chirping) If you need anything else, you can go to hell.
- Marty, don't move!
- Marty. Here we... It's Morgan!
- How many times do I got... ?
- (g\*n chamber clicking)
- Sorry, puss. Sleep time.
- (groaning)
- (panting)
- (phone chirps)
- (panting)
- Come on, Chuck, pick up.
- (phone ringing)
- Sarah, I am the idiot of the century.
- Chuck, Amy just escaped with Gaez.
- She's the traitor. Where are you?
- I'm at the Buy More. The store is closed.
- Where are you?
- We're locked down in Castle, but trying to override the system.
- Gaez and Amy are headed your way.
- They're in the elevator.
- Okay, listen.
- Do not try and fight them.
- Just hold tight, and we'll be right there.
- Yeah, well, there's no real time for that.
- Okay? Just stay by the monitors and spot them for me.
- Female Voice: Lockdown engaged.
- He's a dead man.
- Well, he's got a plan.
- At least, I think he does.
- (Chuck panting)
- God, is he shopping? What's he doing?
- Hey, they're following you. You've got ten seconds.
- Well, can I just take these ten seconds to apologize for being such a fool?
- Chuck, now's not the time.
- Chuck?
- Give us the key to the store, and we're gone for good.
- You're no match for us, and you know it.
- We don't want to hurt you, but we will certainly enjoy doing it if we have to.
- (clack)
- Talk to me, Sarah. Where are they?
- They're at the Nerd Herd desk.
- Okay, I just want to say that I have no intention of opening up any more cans of worms, or Pandora's boxes or anything else like that.
- I just want you to be happy.
- Okay, please just concentrate on getting out of this alive.
- Well, that would a lot easier if I knew you'd consider forgiving me.
- No time for that. They're headed your way.
- (sighs)
- (grunting)
- (grunting) Oh!
- Oh! (grunts)
- I don't like fighting girls.
- (grunts)
- I mean, women.
- I was taught to be a gentleman.
- (Chuck groans)
- (grunts)
- (wind whipping)
- (panting)
- Going somewhere... p\*ssy?
- (cat yowls)
- Small price to pay to find the real traitor.
- Yeah, took us long enough.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- (laughs)
- I should have never jumped to conclusions.
- Me, neither. It cost us a lot of years.
- Yeah.
- We could try to make up for it.
- We were good friends.
- I miss that.
- Yeah.
- Well, there is, uh, this... engagement party.
- I'll be there.
- Me, too. I have an apology to make.
- I would love to have you guys.
- At the wedding, too, if you can make it.
- Maybe you... you could be bridesmaids?
- I've never been a bridesmaid.
- Well, pretended to once for a mission.
- I did, too, once, but there was a machine g\*n under the pink taffeta.
- Oh. (laughter)
- Well, maybe we can try it for real this time.
- Mm.
- No machine g\*n.
- Scary, but I'll give it a sh\*t.
- All right.
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Can I just... ?
- Chuck, no more apologies.
- I- I want to say thank you.
- I'm really glad that the girls are here tonight, and that they'll be here for the wedding.
- I'm just not ready to dive into my past right now.
- Yeah. No way. Nuh-uh.
- And my family...
- Well, there's no misunderstanding to straighten out, really.
- I know that it's complicated.
- I totally hear you. I-I do.
- And I'm done helping out.
- No, Chuck, please don't ever stop helping me.
- There are a thousand ways that I need your help every single day, and you're perfect.
- Well, then I'll stick to those.
- Mmm.
- Let's party.
- Let's do it.
- ♪♪
- I want to start.
- Okay.
- We're, um...
- We're done.
- It's not that I think you were unfaithful.
- I just...
- I mean, leggy girls, getting half the truth...
- I don't fit into this world.
- I can count the amount of special relationships I've had on half of one hand.
- Me, too.
- Then why don't I feel special, Morgan?
- I just feel lied to.
- I'm sorry.
- No, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Hear me out, okay?
- The reason I kept Carina a secret from you is because I didn't know how to handle you running into someone I'd had a... a relationship with.
- To be honest, there have been so few that it was damn near a statistical impossibility.
- (laughs)
- I want you to know something, though.
- Nothing happened between us, because nothing means more to me than this relationship.
- I would never do anything to threaten that.
- Ever.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- I am in love with you.
- Like, for real, "I love you"?
- Oh, for real I love you, I love you.
- I love you, too.
- But you cannot do this.
- I won't. I promise.
- I think I owe you an apology.
- I acted like a real...
- It's okay.
- He loves me.
- Hi. This is lovely.
- Oh. I'm so glad that you think so.
- I'm just really happy being here in a dress and having a little wine.
- (chuckling) So...
- (sighs) What's on your mind?
- Oh.
- Must be hard... being here without your family.
- Yeah, well, I'm...
- I don't really know where my father is, and I have a very strained relationship with my mother, so, it's...
- Complicated?
- Yeah.
- How about you and I talk about this?
- We can get Chuck involved later.
- That would be great. Thank you.
- We're practically family, right?
- Yeah.
- More importantly, though, we're friends.
- Yeah.
- Well, I-I have a question for you.
- I was wondering if you would be my maid of honor.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
- Oh, I would love to. Of course.
- Oooh, who says Cats can't play nice?
- You'll never know. Maybe will either another member of this squad.
