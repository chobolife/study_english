# Chuck Versus the Balcony

- [DOGS BARKING]
- [PANTING]
- [MEN SHOUTING IN FRENCH]
- [GRUNTS]
- [MEN SHOUTING IN FRENCH]
- [POUNDING ON DOOR]
- Good year.
- [GRUNTS]
- [IN FRENCH] The chip isn't here.
- [MEN SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
- [SIREN WAILING NEARBY]
- [CHUCK CLEARS THROAT]
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Mm.
- Chuck, are you feeling okay?
- Fine. Good. Great. I'm great.
- Heh, great. Why do you ask?
- You seem a little nervous.
- Me nervous. No, I'm not.
- I don't feel nervous at all, I don't think.
- Just... It's just this is a very... It's an incredibly romantic restaurant.
- I'm just taking it all in.
- Chuck, you can talk to me.
- Is this about your mom?
- No.
- Um, I've realized something. After all the stuff... with my mom and Volkoff and...
- I realized that, you know, I haven't really been thinking about us.
- You and me, heh.
- I've been so wrapped up in all the things I couldn't control... that I forgot to focus on the things that I could.
- Like tonight.
- What about tonight?
- Um...
- I've been dragging my feet on this. I've been waiting for the right moment... to talk about what it's gonna be like for us and our future and...
- Chuck, don't even worry about it. I know you've got so much going on.
- You've had so much happen to you in the last few months.
- Uh, besides, I've got such a bad history with proposals.
- [GAGS]
- No. No, not me. My parents had a nightmare proposal.
- I'm sure it can't have been that bad.
- No, it was bad.
- My mother's family had a restaurant. It was similar to this and they loved it... so my dad wanted to propose there.
- God, he had the champagne and the flowers... and the band and the balloons and...
- I mean, it was chaotic. It was so over-the-top... and in all the confusion, somebody knocked over a candle... and it lit the rug on fire.
- Luckily, my mother and her family got out with only minor burns.
- Minor burns. You don't say.
- Yeah.
- So please take your time, Chuck. Heh, no rush.
- [CHUCKLES]
- Um, that's an awful story. I mean, that's really, really awful.
- I'm sure they had a great laugh about it on their wedding day, right?
- No. They took it as a sign and they postponed the wedding.
- My dad always said it was the beginning of the end of their relationship.
- What was that noise?
- Uh, noise? What noise. Oh, my jaw. I have a cracking jaw.
- Can you hear that? I thought I told you about that.
- When we're kissing or whatever?
- If you would just excuse me, I'm just gonna, ha, ha...
- I'll be right back.
- Morgan, Morgan, abort.
- Damn it, I knew it.
- Not enough balloons.
- You bought the whole store. No.
- No balloons. The proposal is off.
- We can't have it in an Italian restaurant.
- Is she on a no-carb thing?
- No, we can't have it in any restaurant. That's how her parents' proposal went.
- We gotta shut it down, gotta shut it down now.
- I can't shut it down.
- Why? What are you talking about?
- The champagne, the string quartet, the caballeros.
- The caballos?
- Whatever, man. It's all in motion.
- We are in too deep here.
- [GRUNTS]
- Excuse me. Hey. Hi.
- The champagne, let's cancel that.
- The bottle's already open. Um, who's gonna drink it?
- I... Ugh, this lovely couple. Please, my treat.
- Oh, no, we don't indulge.
- Says who?
- [WHISPERS] What?
- [CHUCK STAMMERING]
- Get out. Go.
- Man: All right.
- Oh, Beckman called. We've got a mission.
- Oh, gosh. That's really a bummer. I wanted to...
- Well, duty's duty, right?
- [NEIGHS]
- No. Take a hike.
- Let's take the side exit. It's really scenic, huh?
- Morgan: My balloons.
- BECKMAN [OVER MONITOR]: Agent Rosenbaum, one of our finest... was g*n down earlier today while transporting a nanochip... containing the secret locations and blueprints... of our CIA black sites in Europe. This is the chip.
- [COMPUTER BLEEPS]
- A nanochip can be injected into an agent if in trouble.
- And then extracted back at Langley.
- None of that sounds very pleasant.
- I'm sorry, general.
- Some moron was clogging up Ventura with a horse and carriage.
- Beckman: At ease, colonel.
- Agent Rosenbaum's body was returned to us... yet our tests show no trace of the nanochip's presence.
- We believe the chip is somewhere within this chateau.
- Uh, don't tell me this mission is in France.
- Beckman: Pierre Melville, a French radical turned t*rror1st... is also searching for the nanochip.
- Um, one of Volkoff's men?
- Not every criminal works for Alexei Volkoff, Chuck.
- Agents Walker, Bartowski... you'll attend the wine-tasting gala at the chateau tomorrow.
- Colonel, you will be posing as Agent Bartowski's personal manservant.
- [SIGHS]
- Casey: Colonel in the Marine Corps demoted to manservant for a nerd.
- [CHUCK CLEARS THROAT]
- Hey, um, I'm sorry about dinner.
- Hey, no, it's just dinner, you know, heh.
- I should, uh, go check in with Morgan.
- [COMPUTER BLEEPS]
- General, I know why Chuck was asking about Volkoff.
- He's concerned for his family.
- And I wanna make something absolutely clear.
- I will do anything to help bring back Chuck's mother... and to eliminate Volkoff and his organization.
- I understand your commitment, Agent Walker, and I commend it.
- But we must wait for the right opportunity.
- Morgan: It was just dinner.
- It's hard enough asking a super spy to marry you... but I have to propose to a super spy with proposal issues.
- Hey, buddy, we will bounce back. I was thinking...
- No, we're not gonna bounce back.
- What happened to Sarah's parents became a symbol for everything in life.
- I need the perfect proposal. And, of course, we have a new mission.
- You are going to a chateau in the French countryside.
- Moats and wine and the woman of your dreams.
- What are you proposing?
- What am I... ?
- Come here. Sub-mission.
- Your assignment: To ask Sarah Walker to marry you in the Loire Valley.
- It is known as the Garden of France. You know that?
- The best part of this whole idea is the CIA is footing the bill.
- I need to think about my team and the objective.
- Not to mention I'm a horrible multitasker.
- No sub-mission.
- I respect that.
- And respectfully disagree.
- We have exhausted all Burbank proposal options.
- What we need is a marital miracle, and I think this is it.
- Why is everyone so obsessed with marriage?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- You should take care of that.
- Morgan: Me?
- No, no. That's why I have my fixer. Uh, Michael?
- Mike: Talk to me, Patel.
- You seem more angry and unhappy than usual, which is tough.
- You're a curmudgeonly little guy.
- I just wanna be free, Big Michael. But my control-freak parents... have arranged a marriage for me.
- [SIGHS]
- First generation woes. Tough stuff.
- They're stuck in the ways of the old country. Dated traditions... obsolete dietary restrictions. I keep telling them... I live in the United States of America now.
- I'm not in Canada anymore.
- You mean India, right?
- What? No.
- No, I'm from Saskatchewan. The Hinjews of Saskatchewan.
- Some believe that we were a cult of sorts.
- I see.
- Lester: Anyway, they don't get it.
- I've embraced America and its great traditions... like online dating.
- Which, FYI...
- [SING-SONGY] ... I am k*ll it.
- Ha, ha, I've been there.
- I've had three dates already today.
- During work?
- They come to me, man.
- Not great, uh, individually, but solid fours.
- Three fours? That's a 12.
- Exactly, man. No Saskatchewan bride could ever top that.
- And the worst part is, my parents are sending her here.
- What the hell am I gonna do?
- How about the truth, son? The truth shall set you free.
- Brilliant. But let her down easy.
- The truth can be harsh. Let's... Let's be kind about this.
- Thanks, bud.
- The nanochip emits an encrypted signal that only our CIA trackers can detect.
- Need to get close enough to pick up the signal... recover the chip before Pierre and his men.
- Check. Let's go.
- Casey: Yeah.
- [WHISPERING] Hey, hey, hey. Where are you going?
- Time for the real mission. The sub-mission.
- No, no, Morgan, we've talked about this.
- Listen to me. Everything is in place for a perfect proposal, okay?
- I've pinpointed potential proposal locations.
- Here, balcony overlooking the countryside... rose garden, quaint stone bridge.
- When searching for this nano-whatever, choose whichever location you like.
- I don't care, but watch Sarah. She'll show you to the spot.
- And remember something. You can do this.
- Morgan, I've already told you, no sub-mission.
- Well, at least you're keeping an open mind about it, so...
- [CROWD CHATTERING]
- No sign of Pierre yet.
- Keep your eyes open.
- Right. I'm on it.
- Is this place amazing or what? It feels so...
- Romantic.
- Yeah.
- I know.
- MORGAN [OVER PHONE]: Chuck.
- Morgan.
- You were so right. This place is magical.
- I knew it. I knew it.
- Listen, you can do this. I put the ring in the right pocket... earpiece in the left pocket, and then mints in both pockets.
- And also, listen, I will be here at base... quarterbacking the whole way. So you are good to go, bro.
- This is crazy.
- But you're still gonna do it, right?
- Look sharp. This nanochip isn't gonna find itself.
- I wanna be out of this French hellhole and back stateside for lunch tomorrow, hmm.
- [CASEY CHUCKLES]
- Casey: All these fancy frogs.
- Forget it. I'm not gonna be able to do anything with Casey being... well, Casey.
- Chuck, bubbeleh, come on, Casey is your manservant.
- Let him man-serve you.
- [IN BRITISH ACCENT] You there. Jonathan.
- Have you unpacked the lady's luggage, yet?
- Call me Jonathan, I'll break your leg. CHUCK [IN NORMAL VOICE]: Cover.
- Remember your cover.
- You are supposed to be searching underground... while Sarah and I search above ground with all the wine and cheese.
- [IN BRITISH ACCENT] Oh, one more thing, Jon-Jon... could you put my slippers out for tonight?
- That'd be very helpful. Thanks so much. Off you go. Chop-chop.
- Heh.
- What was it we were do... ? Oh, yes, this is where we were.
- We should be looking for the nanochip, huh?
- Yes. Yes, we should.
- Not getting a signal here. Search upstairs?
- Shall we?
- Still no signal.
- Where is this thing?
- Wow!
- Chuck, look at where we are. It's beautiful.
- We're gonna have a sub-mission location confirmation.
- Western-facing balcony. I'm in.
- Yes.
- I knew you could handle a mission with a sub-mission. All right, let's go.
- CASEY [OVER RADIO]: Bartowski. Good call on sending me down to the cellar.
- I got a signal on the nanochip.
- [WHISPERING] Hold up, hold up.
- Is everything okay, Casey?
- Pierre's down here. Looks like he's using the party as a cover as well.
- MAN 1: Sir.
- I found this beneath the racks.
- bl*od.
- Excellent year.
- It's an '86 Chateau Le Franc.
- Must have injected it into one of these bottles.
- Find every bottle of that vintage.
- The nanochip is in a bottle of '86 Chateau Le Franc.
- [BEEPING]
- Casey: Signal is weaker. Bottle's on the move.
- Okay, Casey. We're on our way.
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- [TRACKER BEEPS]
- Someone is here.
- No one leaves this room alive.
- You told Casey to go to the cellar?
- Yeah, yeah.
- [TRACKER BEEPING]
- Wait, wait, wait. I'm picking up a signal.
- I think the bottle's outside.
- Okay. You get the wine, I'll get Casey.
- How's it going, buddy? What is the sub-mission status?
- On hold, buddy. I'm busy chasing a priceless '86 Chateau Le Franc.
- [TRACKER BEEPING]
- [SIGHS]
- Oh, Morgan, flag on the play. I've lost it.
- I've lost the bottle.
- Right. Right.
- Chuck, the '86 Chateau Le Franc is a peppery Pinot... stable on the label, stork on the cork.
- Chuck: Copy that.
- Wha... ? What? It was a peppery Pinot, right?
- With cork on the stork and label on the stable?
- No. It's a stable on the label and a cork on the stork.
- Dude, it's... No, it's not. What did you say?
- [GASPS]
- [SIGHS]
- Casey, I'm outside the cellar door.
- CASEY [OVER RADIO]: This place is crawling with French bad guys.
- [BEEPS]
- Sarah: Oh, it's so bright.
- [GRUNTS]
- Hello? Anyone here?
- Oh, God. I'm... Heh, oh, God.
- I'm so sorry, I've, um...
- I'm just a little bit lost. I've had just a bit too much wine.
- I'm so embarrassed. I just... I...
- I broke my heel and my...
- My ankle, it just kind of really hurts right now.
- [SARAH GRUNTS]
- [SILENCED g*n]
- [MEN GROAN]
- I can't stand this country.
- [TRACKER BEEPING]
- A stable on the label and a stork on the cork.
- Oh.
- Gotcha.
- It's a fine vintage, isn't it? It's peppery.
- Well-structured for aging. Lots of tannins.
- Chuck, Casey's okay. Do you have the bottle?
- Uh, the nanochip has been poured into somebody's glass.
- Find the right glass. I'm on my way.
- Fine. I'm all over it. Meet you on the balcony.
- Looks like Pierre is MIA.
- Come on.
- [TRACKER BEEPING]
- [TRACKER BEEPING RAPIDLY]
- Sir. Hi. Sir, hi.
- Excuse me. Um...
- I'm sorry, but there's been a mixup downstairs.
- You received the wrong glass of wine. That's the g*n from Bordeaux... with the coil on the foil and fork on the cork.
- Does not make sense, they are both regions.
- This is the peppery Pinot... with the stable on the label and the stork on the cork.
- In fact, I have been waiting to taste this exact bottle... for two decades.
- Chuck: Don't...
- I didn't wanna have to tell you this, but there is something in your wine.
- Yes, there is something in the wine.
- Two hundred years of French history.
- The bl*od and sweat of my ancestors. The pride of lords and peasants alike.
- You, sir, wouldn't know the difference between this... and a glass of Two Buck Chuck.
- Chuck: First of all... I happen to like Two Buck Chuck. Great bang for your buck. Second of all, you are danger-close to becoming a walking cliché, sir.
- Goodbye. My pinot.
- Stop. Give me the glass of wine.
- You mean this glass of wine?
- [GRUNTING AND SHOUTING]
- What's happening? Talk to me.
- I've got the nanochip.
- Sub-mission on?
- The sub-mission is so on.
- Yes. Fantastic. FYI, sunset is in three minutes, okay?
- And everyone looks good at golden hour. Everyone.
- [SIGHS]
- Chuck: Where's Casey?
- Getting the car. Nanochip?
- One peppery Pinot with a hint of nanochip in the finish.
- Sarah: Good work, Chuck.
- Look at that.
- Just in time for sunset.
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- It's perfect.
- Good.
- There's, uh... There's something I've wanted to...
- [METAL CLANGS]
- What the... ?
- Casey: Chuck, Sarah. Move it.
- That's our ride. Let's go.
- Huh?
- [SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
- [SIGHS]
- [DOOR OPENS]
- General Beckman?
- I have decided to debrief the team in person.
- The CIA has analyzed the nanochip. The secret locations and blueprints... of our European black sites are now safe.
- But your mission isn't over. You're going back to France.
- Not again.
- Not you, colonel.
- A couple in love are more believable turncoats.
- Agents Walker, Bartowski... using back channels, we have contacted Pierre Melville.
- He now believes you're rogue CIA agents who want to sell the chip back to him.
- Pierre believes we're traitors. But how does that help us?
- You're gonna sell him a different chip.
- Beckman: Spot on, colonel.
- The chip suspended in this liquid is a long-range tracking beacon.
- Return to the chateau, swap cases with Pierre... then our Paris office will track him and root out the entire t*rror1st cell.
- Is that clear?
- Chuck: Yes, ma'am.
- Good, because you leave tonight.
- Agent Walker, a word.
- [DOOR OPENS]
- I want you to be the one to make this drop.
- This operation is highly sensitive. It must go smoothly.
- Of course, general.
- Dismissed.
- Lester: Stick to the plan. Jinsana should be here any minute.
- [DOOR OPENS]
- Damn.
- Lester Patel, you lucky little Canadian.
- Oh, my God. She's a 12.
- It's the stuff of legend. A flawless Hinjew specimen.
- I want her as my own. Change of plans. Marriage is on.
- Stop Big Mike then stall her. I got three fat girls to break up with.
- You must be Jinsana.
- Yes, I am. Do you know where Lester Patel is?
- Uh, look, Jinsana. I know you've traveled a long way... but I'm supposed to give you some bad news.
- Uh, hi. Mr. Patel needs to, uh, reschedule.
- His calendar has him free in, uh... half-hour?
- Okay. Guess I'll come back.
- Let me...
- Come on, Chuck, it's okay.
- It was so perfect. Everything. The sunset, the balcony.
- You cannot b*at yourself up. You were on a mission.
- There were distractions, things out of your control. Let's move past that.
- What is the only thing better than a sunset?
- Things going right for a change?
- No, no.
- Moonlight, okay?
- Don't give up on me. You know the perfect spot now.
- You're going back to the chateau with Sarah. Come on, this is fate.
- The proposal is gonna work, dude.
- It's lovely to see you again, Jinsana.
- Mr. Lester Indira Golda Patel awaits.
- Jinsana: Thank you.
- This way, please.
- Lester: Welcome to my domain.
- Jinsana Gupta, please come, sit.
- Sit.
- Look, Lester, I'm just a normal...
- Shh.
- I accept you.
- It is written. Jeffrey, please.
- With the poutine and the Manischewitz.
- Lester, you're obviously much more traditional than I am.
- And the truth is, this is freaking me out a little bit.
- Just, please, Jinsana. Just look, I, ugh...
- I am not traditional at all, actua...
- [SITAR PLAYING]
- Look, this isn't the real me.
- All right? Please just give me a chance to show you who the real Lester Patel is.
- I promise, I make a fantastic... third impression.
- [CHUCKLES]
- So this wasn't really you?
- No, no. I was trying to impress you.
- Aw, that's kind of cute.
- Okay. We can give it another sh*t.
- So it is written.
- Ha, ha, no, no, it's not written, Jeffrey. Not written.
- Maybe we pencil it in.
- [WHISTLES]
- [MORGAN YELLS]
- Hi, Morgan.
- Oh, Sarah, mental.
- We need to have a conversation.
- You just scared me to death. I thought you could've been somebody deadly.
- I am somebody deadly.
- Hmm.
- And I know everything.
- The balcony, the moonlight. Does that ring a bell?
- These bearded lips are staying shut. I know nothing.
- Chuck is planning on proposing at the chateau and I want your intel.
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- Okay. Don't you wanna be surprised?
- I'm a spy. I hate surprises.
- Okay. Chuck told me about your parents' proposal.
- It'll be better than that.
- Oh, God. I should never have told him that stupid story.
- Probably not. Probably not.
- But you did and it's the reason we called off our restaurant proposal.
- What? Wait.
- Chuck was planning on proposing at the restaurant?
- What is wrong with me? I cannot keep my mouth shut.
- No. No, it's good. It's good that you told me.
- Look, Sarah, the whole reason Chuck is doing this proposal... is to wipe the slate clean, all right? It's all for you.
- And it's gonna be amazing and romantic.
- It's gonna be everything that you want.
- Okay.
- I am taking control of this operation now.
- Morgan, you will now be working for me.
- Okay. Kind of like a, uh... Like a double agent.
- Exactly. We're gonna make this proposal happen for Chuck's sake.
- Yeah.
- And for mine.
- Chuck: We got a couple of French t*rrorists... a briefcase full of cash, and a nanochip... so no more terrifying than usual.
- Although, if we get done early, we take a stroll around the chateau.
- That does sound lovely, Chuck.
- But, ugh, listen, I have this weird feeling about this mission.
- I don't know, I just can't shake it. Something feels off.
- MORGAN [OVER RADIO]: Sarah, it's Morgan. We're totally on a secure line.
- Okay, listen, up, the proposal is a go on the western balcony.
- All right, lunar calculations are complete. We are banking on a full moon proposal.
- That is a full moon proposal.
- Copy that. Now listen, if anything goes wrong... you are to tell me about it immediately.
- Of course. I am on it. You can count on me.
- CHUCK [OVER RADIO]: Morgan.
- Oh, hold on a second.
- I have to scram because, uh, Chuck is on two.
- Hey, Chuck, how's the man? How's the myth? How is the view?
- Does Sarah seem jumpy to you? I mean, do you think she's on to us?
- What? No. No. Sarah? Onto us? Come on, buddy, get real.
- Keep your head in the game, though. Focus.
- If I can give you one piece of fatherly advice, I'd...
- [CLICKING OVER RADIO]
- You futzing with the ring box?
- No.
- I can hear you futzing with the ring box.
- Keep futzing with the ring, you tarnish the sheen.
- Are you nervous? You get all sweaty.
- Relax, okay? Okay? Buddy, I got it. I...
- Yeah. I gotta go, I gotta go. We got company.
- Please go smoothly. Please go smoothly.
- It rains in Paris, ma cherie.
- But only in the spring.
- Sarah: It's done. That was easy.
- We're done? Seriously? Great. Good, we're done.
- Bravo. Excellent work. Fantastic.
- Um, meet me at our balcony and we'll celebrate with a glass of wine.
- I'll meet you there.
- It's time to come clean.
- This girl is about to meet the real Lester.
- And Jeff.
- Let's just keep the focus on me, okay, buddy?
- [SIGHS]
- Hey, Jinsana, listen.
- I am sorry that I pretended to be somebody that I'm not.
- So behold the real Lester Patel.
- Uncut, unabridged, in living color.
- Should we go get a drink or something?
- Something.
- Jeffrey, hit it.
- [BAND PLAYING WHITESNAKE'S "IS THIS LOVE"]
- Man: Hey, Patel, what are you doing?
- This one's for the lady.
- [SINGING] I find I spend my time Waiting on your call How can I tell you, baby My back's against the wall...
- Shake out the butterflies.
- Shake them out, shake them out, shake them out.
- Sarah...
- Is this love I know that you have some issues with proposals.
- Is this the love What am I talking about? I can't... I can't mention her parents.
- Don't talk about the parents. Clean slate. Here we go, start over.
- This must be love Do a knee thing? Probably have to do a knee thing.
- Which knee... ?
- Chuck, how's it going?
- The mission went great. They never go this smoothly.
- It's got to be a sign.
- [CHUCK GRUNTING]
- Morgan: God, Chuck.
- Did you think I would let you two walk away with my money?
- [GRUNTING AND SHOUTING]
- Holy... Who was that guy?
- Dude, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, buddy, I'm fine. I got my jacket a little dirty, though.
- Right. Tide to Go sticks, left jacket pocket.
- Morgan, you are genius.
- Morgan: All right, you hide the bad guys, I'll check in on Sarah.
- Is this the love That I've been searching for Lester, that was...
- Shh.
- I know, baby. I know.
- The most uncomfortable five minutes of my life.
- But wait, wait, wait. I wanna get married.
- Try the Internet.
- Is that the chateau security feed?
- Maybe.
- Well, in case you hadn't heard, the mission is over.
- They made the exchange.
- Wait a minute. Are you conducting a sub-mission?
- He's gonna pop the question to Walker, isn't he?
- How'd you know that?
- Because I'm a spy, not a moron.
- But you're right, he's gonna need all the help he can get.
- Sarah, you just stopped. What's the matter?
- Sarah: I don't know.
- I think, for the first time in my life, I'm... nervous.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- You got butterflies. She has butterflies.
- That's completely natural, it's... Everybody gets butterflies.
- I don't get butterflies.
- Morgan: That's not what I'm saying.
- What I'm saying is that's Chuck Bartowski out on that balcony.
- You know, he is the best friend that I've ever had.
- [WHISPERS] No offense.
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] I know you aren't, uh, asking and maybe it's a little silly... but, uh, you have my permission to marry him.
- He's all yours, so...
- Take care of him.
- Thank you, Morgan.
- Uh-oh.
- We have a problem.
- No. Sarah just has butter...
- Look, moron. Look. The ring.
- Walker, check your 6, by your feet.
- Bartowski dropped the ring.
- Oh, my God. Pick it up, pick it up.
- Look at the moon, Chuck.
- It's perfect.
- [CASEY SIGHS]
- [MORGAN CHUCKLES]
- [CHUCKLES]
- I've been to so many places around the world... but never been to a place as beautiful as this.
- Chuck: I have.
- Every day.
- Every morning I wake up and I look at you.
- When we brush our teeth, tandem style.
- [CHUCKLES]
- When we watch TV together. Whatever, anything, always... every time I look at you... it's the most beautiful place I've ever been.
- I just... I feel I should be James Bond right now, you know?
- The guy who is standing on this balcony with you in this moment...
- I didn't fall in love with James Bond. I fell in love with you.
- Here we go. Yup, yup.
- She is good.
- Sarah, I'm...
- I'm gonna ask you a question right now, so please don't freak out, okay?
- I won't.
- I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
- Going on missions and saving the day and being heroes.
- But mostly, though, I just wanna be with you.
- At your side, always.
- [CHUCKLES]
- Sarah... will you... ?
- AGENT 1: Freeze. Don't move. CIA.
- Chuck: Whoa, whoa, what's going on here?
- We're on a mission. Stop. No.
- It's legit.
- AGENT 2: Agent Sarah Walker, you're under arrest.
- For what? AGENT 2: Treason.
- What?
- What? No. No.
- No, hey, hey.
- Sarah: Chuck.
- Wait.
- Chuck: Stop. This is all wrong.
- Sarah: Chuck?
- How could anyone possibly think that Sarah is a traitor?
- I mean, look at this stuff. Look at this stuff, Casey.
- She was making the drop That was our mission.
- Sit down, Bartowski. You're making me dizzy.
- I was gonna propose to her, Casey.
- You know, I proposed once.
- To Kathleen.
- We had plans to go to Niagara Falls. I was about to ship out.
- We were young, and I was stupid, and things got screwed up.
- So I ended up proposing in a Buffalo bus station.
- Not exactly the most romantic spot in the world.
- But I'll always have that day. I'll always have that look on her face.
- There's no such thing as a perfect moment... or a perfect spot.
- So forget about the balcony, Bartowski.
- All you need is the girl.
- General, please, please, please.
- Go ahead, Chuck. You two have some things to discuss.
- I don't need a balcony, a sunset. We have each other... and that's all that matters.
- Chuck, I'm leaving.
- What?
- What? Where are they taking you?
- They're not taking me, Chuck. I'm going.
- Beckman never thought that I was a traitor. It was a setup.
- The perfect opportunity to establish my cover as a double agent.
- Chuck, we have so much together.
- We have a real life and a future.
- But I need to go back to being the old me... just for a little while longer... if I plan on surviving this.
- Surviving what? Where are you going?
- I'm going undercover into Volkoff Industries.
- Take them down from the inside.
- No.
- No. No, you're not. That's exactly how I lost my mom.
- That's how you're gonna get her back. I'm doing this for you.
- I'm doing it for us.
- Why does it have to be you?
- Chuck, you have to trust me.
- For Beckman's plan to work, it has to be me.
- I'm sorry.
- Agent Walker, it's time.
- I love you.
- I love you too, Chuck.
- I'm not gonna come back without your mom.
