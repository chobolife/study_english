# Chuck Versus the Anniversary

- Mary: "And the king was freed, and the castle was restored... and the Frost Queen returned home once more.
- This time, she was a hero.
- And the Frost Queen promised her children... that she would never, ever leave them again. "
- Good story?
- I liked it.
- The prince was cool.
- Mary: Yes, he was, just like my little Chuck.
- Mom.
- Yeah?
- Are you going away again?
- Just for a few days, then right back to you and Ellie.
- Good night, honey.
- Love you.
- Not nearly as much as I love you.
- Chuck: My mom was a spy.
- After she disappeared, my father spent the rest of his life trying to find her.
- Ellie and I thought she left us, that she just walked away.
- But what if we were wrong?
- I need your help.
- I need you to help me find my mom.
- Holy cow. I cannot believe this was beneath your house.
- This is nuts.
- A secret spy base, and it's got lasers and gadgets and neatly organized files.
- Why don't you just tell Casey and Sarah?
- I know they're gonna try and stop me. They cannot.
- I have to find the truth, Morgan: Why my mom left, why she never came back.
- This is my search.
- No, it's our search.
- I'm in.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.
- Are you flexing?
- What? No.
- I'm just kind of excited.
- Okay, good, good.
- I can't even tell you how much I appreciate your help.
- But one very, very, very important thing: We cannot tell anyone, not a soul.
- Not Sarah, not Casey, not Awesome, not Ellie. Not Ellie.
- I know. You promised her you weren't gonna be a spy.
- So she clearly cannot know about our little rogue spy team here.
- Outside of the government, secret to the spy world.
- Team of two, army of one, highway to the danger zone, live free or die...
- Buddy.
- Yeah?
- This is not the opening of a TV show. This is real life.
- Is this the g*n you were looking for?
- Yes.
- Got everything, dude. You ready to go?
- [WHISPERS] She's still here?
- Hurry up.
- Yeah?
- You're the best. Thank you so much.
- Chuck: Mm.
- Spy mission without me.
- Couples do this all the time, right?
- It's just a business trip.
- You okay with this?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Um, I got job interviews, and Morgan and I will spend quality time.
- He signed us up for a go-kart racing league, so...
- Come home soon.
- Sarah: Mm.
- [DOOR OPENS]
- Ugh, I'm gonna be sick.
- Walker, we got real work to do, like save the free world.
- Enjoy retirement, Bartowski.
- What am I, uh... ? What do I say?
- "I love you. "
- That's good, "I love you. " I like that. I love you too.
- [SIGHS]
- Be safe, okay?
- Nothing is gonna keep me from coming back to you.
- Better not.
- Sarah: Bye.
- Morgan: Mr. Carmichael, we're all set.
- I have our tickets, cloned passports, money belts.
- Let's do this. Back in the game. Me and you, real spies.
- Sunblock. We need sunblock.
- Man: Excuse me.
- Very sorry.
- Pardon me.
- Aah!
- [SIREN WAILING]
- [GRUNTS]
- Agh.
- I knew it. I was right.
- My mom's safe house. This is where she got all her missions when I was a kid.
- Speaking as the bookkeeper for our joint account... it might've been more affordable if we started here and then traveled the world.
- Yeah, well, we didn't really know about here, now, did we?
- You got the code, buddy?
- Yeah. Yeah, code, code, code.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Oh, uh, if we get a second, we need to have a budget conversation...
- Hey, Morgan, not now.
- This is it.
- My dad never made it this far.
- Okay, Mom, where are you?
- And it's not empty, right?
- Please tell me that it's not empty.
- I don't get it. I don't get it. All the intel led right back here.
- No, no, no. There's gotta be something.
- There's gotta be a... A... A secret compartment, you know?
- Or a passageway, or some clue that finally leads us to my mom.
- [BANGING]
- Yeah.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- There's nothing.
- Okay, so we didn't find your mom... but, uh, maybe we found a new dumpling house, huh?
- All right, well, I don't know.
- Let's pack it up, uh, head home... fuel up on some dumplings, and we start again from scratch, okay?
- Now, we can do this, you and I...
- [SIGHS]
- All right.
- We got close this time.
- I know we're gonna find her.
- Oh, Chuck.
- Talk to me, buddy, you know? Let it out.
- You wanna cry, go for it. I got two good shoulders.
- What are we doing? Why are we even bothering looking for my mom?
- My dad ruined his life trying to find her.
- She could've come back anytime she wanted to.
- We're easy to find. Her, not so much.
- I'm done, man. I think I'm done.
- Uh, listen, we have to try, right?
- [g*n COCKS]
- Don't move, Chuck.
- Harry: Get over here.
- Morgan, Morgan, Morgan.
- Coming, coming.
- Harry: Give me them keys.
- Yeah, here you go, sir. Here they are. Here are your keys.
- Just please don't sh**t me or Chuck.
- Look, if this has anything to do with my mom or Albania or Tangiers... or that café in Budapest...
- That was not his fault.
- Anyway, we have explanations for them.
- What are you talking about? I'm here for the car. I'm a repo man.
- Repo man. Morgan?
- Right. We haven't made a payment in four months.
- The car cost $900.
- Yeah, but we're $43, 000 in debt.
- I was gonna...
- Wait. What? What? 43 what?
- Thousand dollars' debt, and that's above the CIA money you had saved up.
- Being a spy is really expensive.
- [STAMMERS] Why didn't you tell me?
- You were so busy looking for your mom...
- All right, enough chitchat. Get away from that car.
- Uh, Chuck, give him a little... You know what I mean? Intersect style.
- I don't do kung fu anymore.
- You got some chop-socky, boy?
- No. No chop-socky here, sir. Fresh out of chop-socky.
- Take the car.
- That's what I thought.
- My advice, get a job.
- Working on it.
- Morgan: You know, Chuck, this does not happen to real spies.
- I'm cornered. What do I do?
- MAN [OVER PHONE]: Use the device.
- [g*n COCKS]
- Sarah: Make a move and you're dead, Marco.
- Please, make a move.
- I thought you said the EMP was a fake.
- I was wrong.
- Marco: Beautiful, isn't it?
- Volkoff Industries' handheld EMP generator.
- Will fry every electric circuit in a three-klick radius.
- Volkoff's upping the ante.
- The building elevators are knocked out.
- Mr. Volkoff's agents will be here in minutes.
- You're trapped.
- Put down your g*n.
- [GRUNTS]
- He really should be here. Chuck's the Intersect.
- Could use him on a mission like this. I hate cracking into computer systems.
- Well, he made a promise to his sister.
- Chuck doesn't wanna be a spy and have to lie about it.
- Your boyfriend needs some big-boy pants. He's a spy, he's good at it.
- I know, Casey, you miss him too.
- What? I don't miss him.
- [DOOR OPENS]
- Don't move. Stay where you are.
- Oh, by the way, good idea to bring the chutes.
- Thank you.
- [CAMERA CLICKING]
- Morgan: Yes, nice. I like this.
- But less back. Maybe just kind of, uh...
- Hold that. Right there, this whole sleepy confusion thing.
- That's digital sex right there.
- What are you doing?
- Putting the spark back in your relationship. Sarah's gonna love these.
- Good. Yeah. Actually, if you don't mind, hit the peck deck a little bit.
- Oh, and, uh, a little baby oil, please.
- Lube it up.
- What? Ba... ? Ba... ?
- What? No, no, no.
- Lube it up.
- Whatever you're doing, please stop.
- Okay.
- Okay. I know you're down about your mom, Chuck.
- Let's you and I have a little talk right now, man to man.
- Okay. Okay. Man-to-man talk. What are you doing in my room with baby oil?
- More importantly, you and Sarah.
- Every morning, you wake up missing her, acting like a sad sack. I understand.
- You're stuck in this long-distance relationship that's short on intimacy.
- That's okay. It's all right.
- But what you need to do is open your mind to what sex truly is.
- It's sexting.
- Yeah, short for "sext writing. "
- It's intimacy for people in your situation. Sexting.
- Sexting.
- Sexting.
- Sexting.
- Sexting. Buddy.
- The terrible ideas are out of the way.
- I told Ellie about the job hunt. She's lined up five interviews for today.
- Okay. I'll grab our bus passes.
- But, uh, remember, um, sexting.
- Oh, yeah, sex talk. No, not gonna happen.
- Morgan: Good luck on the job hunt.
- Fine, I'll do it myself.
- I am so glad you could come in. You know, with a résumé like this... and a degree from Stanford, it's astounding you haven't been snatched up.
- Snatch me up. I'm 100 percent snatchable.
- I don't use the word "snatch" often, for a myriad of reasons.
- Relax. Why are you so nervous?
- Ah...
- You know, I'm not normally. I'm normally a smooth operator.
- Like Sade. But today has been a strange, uh, day of interviews.
- Really? Well, how?
- Well, for starters, um, have you ever had anyone fall asleep in an interview?
- [SNORES]
- Um, just after that, the person sitting in your position got a little ill.
- [VOMITS]
- Just after that, the interviewer started going into convulsions.
- The last interview I just came from... they told me they were going for a cup of coffee, and then they never came back.
- I mean, how long does it take to get coffee?
- That's really crazy.
- Yeah.
- Well, um, I think, Chuck, that I have some good news for you.
- Good.
- Yeah. How would you like to join... ?
- [PHONE RINGING]
- Oh. I thought I told them to hold my calls.
- I... I... Uh, I don't think it's a good idea to answer...
- Hello? Yes.
- [WHISPERS] It's about you.
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] What?
- Is everything okay?
- [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
- What's happening? Who is that?
- Uh...
- Unfortunately, Mr. Bartowski, the position has been filled.
- What's happening? Who was that?
- And I'm going to have Security escort you from the building.
- Wait. I'm... Wait, wait, wait. Hang on a second. What did I do?
- Who was that? Perhaps I could explain whatever the situation is.
- This is completely uncalled for.
- Morgan: Look on the bright side, Chuck.
- Bus has much more legroom than the hatchback.
- There's a conspiracy against me.
- I feel that way after a bad interview.
- Except with me, the conspiracy has been going on a lot longer. Like kindergarten.
- What am I supposed to do now?
- These were Ellie's best leads. Where am I gonna find a job?
- Well, there's always one place.
- Where?
- Morgan: I can't believe it's back, Chuck.
- It's beautiful.
- I can't believe how fast they rebuilt it.
- Oh, my...
- Lord.
- Welcome to the Buy More.
- We're not open yet.
- But we are currently accepting résumés.
- Are you interested?
- For what?
- A job.
- Maybe.
- What, uh, types of positions are available?
- I'm sure the store manager can help you with that.
- Have at it.
- Good luck.
- So nervous.
- Do you want me to show you around?
- Yes, that would be delightful. Should I hold your hand?
- No, you should not.
- Okay, lead on.
- Um...
- Hello.
- My name is Chuck Bartowski, and, uh, it's funny, I used to work here.
- Woman: You still do work here.
- Hello, Chuck. Welcome back.
- Huh.
- Beckman had kittens when I told her about the EMP.
- She wants us to find Volkoff's building so we can blow the place up.
- Another mission? We've been at it for months.
- And I haven't seen Chuck in forever.
- There's something else.
- Beckman wants Chuck to come here, take a look at the EMP, see if he flashes.
- Well, Chuck is a civilian now. We can't force him to be a spy, can we?
- You might wanna tell Beckman that yourself.
- Oh, Chuck.
- As you can see, we spared no expense re-creating the Buy More.
- Um, yeah, uh, general, I appreciate the tour and all...
- It's no longer simply a retail store.
- It's now a full-fledged CIA-NSA substation.
- We can patch into security cameras all over the world.
- Satellite relay, NORAD, NASA, the Joint Chiefs.
- Hit that red button, we go to DEFCON 1.
- [CHUCKLES]
- Is that, uh, really the safest place to put that, out in the open?
- There's a laser-based security system.
- This is crazy.
- You realize this is crazy.
- No, it's not.
- After the success of Operation Bartowski... the president made you a priority.
- I beg your pardon? The "president" president? Like the actual?
- You... You're... You're being totally ser...
- I am out of the spy game.
- You're out when I say you're out.
- If memory serves, you actually said, "Chuck, you are out of the spy game. "
- I changed my mind. You're back, discussion over.
- And don't think you're going to find another job.
- Why?
- You, you, you.
- That was you on the phone, wasn't it? You t*nk my interviews, didn't you?
- [PHONE RINGING]
- Oh.
- Hi, Sarah. Back in town?
- Listen, you do not have to be a spy.
- Oh, no, no. I know, yeah.
- Beckman just offered me a position and I turned her down.
- How did she react?
- Well, she...
- Whoa!
- Chuck, hello?
- Chuck: Aah!
- [SCREAMING]
- [GRUNTS]
- [CHUCK PANTING]
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.
- That went well, I think.
- I'm sorry.
- I should have called, but we just got in.
- No, it's fine.
- Because you're here and I'm here.
- And I miss you a lot.
- Mm.
- [SPEAKS IN YIDDISH]
- I miss you too.
- This is the mission that just won't end.
- It's important work.
- But you're here now. At least for a little while, right?
- Few weeks? Days? Hours?
- Okay, enough sap.
- Hey. Sarah, what... ?
- Take a look at the mission at hand. Flash.
- Ah. Ah.
- Well?
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- Thanks, Casey.
- EMP, uh, manufactured in Venezuela, the Corta Verona facility... which is a subsidiary of Volkoff Industries.
- Who's Volkoff? Don't tell me.
- Alexei Volkoff. Arms dealer, recluse.
- He's like the Russian Howard Hughes. We've been chasing after him for months.
- And with that single flash, we might just be able to take him down.
- Good to have you back.
- Oh, I'm not staying.
- I think he misses you. Misses the flash.
- Oh, I know.
- [GRUMBLES]
- This is nuts, man. The Buy More is being run by the CIA. Amazing.
- Which would make you a spy, huh?
- You are very perceptive, Mr. Grimes.
- Yeah, guilty.
- I gotta say, the new Castle is pretty freaking sweet.
- And it's nice to be back down in here with you.
- Can we talk?
- Of course, anytime. About what?
- Well, I know this is awkward, but, um, I just have to ask about the picture.
- [CHUCKLES]
- What, uh... ? What picture?
- Hi-oh.
- Chuck, do you wanna sext with me?
- Ah. No, I don't...
- I mean...
- [CHUCKLES]
- No. No, no.
- Uh, this... This isn't my idea.
- It's clearly not my idea.
- This was Morgan's doing.
- Don't worry. I thought it was cute.
- Here's the thing. I don't know if you know this.
- Uh, I was an agent a little while last year.
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- What if we got together, maybe showed each other a few moves?
- You know, I have a trip to Thailand in the morning.
- Mm. Sure, sure.
- It's a new mission.
- Oh, of course, it's the life of a...
- I could show you something right now.
- Really? Yeah.
- You know?
- Ahem. So six/nine-month anniversary. What do you think?
- Well, I have to go away again.
- But when I come back, we will celebrate in style.
- Fantastic. No phones necessary.
- Unless you want.
- No.
- I don't even know what that means. Forget I ever said that.
- Hey, hey, hey, what is this?
- The emblem? That's Volkoff's.
- He is not afraid to advertise.
- I have to go debrief with Beckman and Casey.
- But we'll talk later?
- Yeah, great.
- Mm.
- Mm.
- [ALARM RINGS]
- [MORGAN SCREAMS]
- [GRUNTS]
- Whoa. Whoa.
- New Buy More rules.
- Slides and trapdoors and the new super spy/Nerd Herder Greta.
- Be still, my b*at heart. She digs me, I can tell.
- Morgan.
- Mm-hm.
- We need to get the car back.
- With the creepy guy?
- [POLICE SIREN WAILING]
- MORGAN [WHISPERS]: Okay.
- I'm sorry. Again, tell me why we're here. This menu is linked to an arms dealer?
- Look, I thought the last mission was a bust, okay?
- But the menu could be the link that brings us to my mom.
- Maybe she was after Volkoff like Sarah.
- Okay, I'll get the menu, we get out of here quietly.
- Yes, yes, quick and quiet.
- There it is.
- Aah! Whoa. Uh...
- You young, oversexed, underworked kids.
- You don't mess with a repo man. Not ever.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Mr. Repo-Man, sir. We are not here to mess with you.
- Morgan, get the...
- Get the menu. Get the...
- Whoa, repo man.
- Excuse me just for one second.
- I'm gonna just very slowly...
- There we go.
- Perfect.
- This is all we want, then we're leaving.
- You want a menu? For what?
- Chinese.
- Dumplings.
- Yeah? Good place?
- No. No. It's...
- No. I wouldn't say...
- I like good Chinese. Hard to find, though. Hand it over.
- You remember how we got out of that jam in Tangiers?
- Think it'll work?
- "Tangiers. " What does that mean?
- It means that we need to run! Run, run, run!
- Damn you!
- I love dumplings.
- Morgan: It's really weird.
- Most of these are just your run-of-the-mill dishes.
- But a few of these I haven't even heard of before.
- Which ones? Which dishes?
- For example, this Shimira Chicken.
- Ah. Shimira.
- Okay, Shimira is actually a nav system for spy subs.
- This is not a menu for ordering food. This is a menu for ordering w*apon.
- Wh... ? Why would your mom have that?
- Let's call and find out.
- Use your dad's encrypted phone.
- [CHUCK MUMBLES]
- [PHONE RINGS]
- Ahem.
- Ahem. Whew.
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- MAN [OVER PHONE]: Who is this? Identify.
- This is Carmichael. I work for The Ring.
- Man: The Ring was eliminated.
- We are an sh**t of The Ring.
- The New Ring.
- I'm the head of security.
- I'll need to see your organization firsthand if we agree to work.
- Then you have to come to Volkoff Industries in Moscow.
- Moscow, Russia. Not a problem.
- The New Ring has very deep pockets.
- We're going to Russia.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna have to sell my Millennium Falcon.
- Then God bless you.
- Man: Are you still there?
- Yes, I'm here.
- Just tell me when and where. We have a jet on standby.
- Casey: Okay, so we ID Volkoff's facility... and we can take it out with a single drone strike.
- Have you ever been in a long-distance relationship?
- No. Ahem.
- I either leave or they die.
- I'm going to the head.

- [CHIME RINGS]
- Woman: Please fasten your seatbelts.
- We're heading into a bit of turbulence.
- Release the gas... and I'll reroute the flight to Moscow.
- [GRUNTS]
- Where are we?
- Well, desolation, frostbite.
- Must be Russia.
- [DOOR OPENS]
- Marco: Welcome to Volkoff Industries.
- Glad you could finally make it.
- Take a load off, relax... and think about all the terrible things that we'll do to you.
- We're pros, Marco. Your methods won't work on us.
- Remember, I work for Volkoff.
- I must break you.
- [SHIVERING]
- Chuck: Remember the plan.
- Access the Volkoff computer system and see what they have on my mom.
- Does that make sense?
- Completely.
- Although, I think my face is still frozen.
- Chuck: Okay.
- Hello. We're with The Ring.
- The New Ring.
- This is Charles Carmichael.
- I'm Michael Carmichael.
- So if you wouldn't mind...
- Frigid in here as well. Wow.
- The plan was for me to be Carmichael and you to be Sven, my mute assistant.
- Here's the thing. These people respect a beard.
- And the whole assistant thing, I see us more as brothers.
- Is that so? Okay, okay, fine.
- What parents in their right mind... would name their child Michael if their last name was Carmichael?
- What were your parents thinking?
- What were our parents thinking?
- You know, it's what people in the movie business call improv.
- Man: Nice photo.
- [GRUNTS]
- Good work, Walker. Get the phone.
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- I know where the server is. It's not far.
- If my father's codes still work, we should get in.
- What do you think? Um, maybe drop a little Intersect style on these fools.
- Karate chop your way in. I will hide behind the receptionist desk.
- Yeah, that, or we could just run really fast.
- Tangiers? Here?
- Tangiers, exactly.
- Ah, could work.
- Pick up the case.
- One, two, three. Here we go.
- Hurry up.
- Sarah: Come on.
- Come on.
- Almost got it.
- [DOOR LOCKS]
- Oh.
- I've never run so fast in so many layers before.
- Game time.
- Yep.
- This place is nuts.
- Yeah, it's a Cold w*r relic, buddy.
- Oh, dude.
- What is this?
- Morgan, that's an EMP.
- So I wouldn't touch that.
- This is an EMP?
- Yes, it is.
- No touching, Morgan. Gotcha, gotcha.
- Casey: Good work, Walker. Call Beckman.
- No, I can't call. It's gonna be too loud. I'll text Chuck. I was texting before.
- [PHONE BEEPS]
- Your phone.
- Yeah, I'm kind of busy right now.
- I'll get it for you.
- Sarah. She's sexting you.
- Not now, Morgan.
- Gotcha.
- Go on, milady.
- [BEEPS]
- What does he say?
- He thinks we're sexting.
- What?
- What does that even mean?
- [PHONE BEEPS]
- "SOS. " SOS.
- Skin on skin.
- Yes, please.
- Oh, come on.
- Filthy.
- He still thinks we're sexting.
- You kiss your mom with those thumbs?
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
- Daddy likes. Oh, you're in trouble.
- Daddy likes.
- [CLANGING]
- [WHISPERS] Hey, someone's coming.
- [WHISPERS] We're inside Volkoff, Subbasement 4. Tell him.
- Got it. Bypassed their security. I'm in.
- Awesome, awesome.
- Anything?
- Nothing coming up with her name.
- I'm checking aliases, missions Dad thought she went on, w*apon she was after.
- [COMPUTER BEEPING]
- Hang on. Hang on. Wait a minute. "Frost. "
- Frost.
- The Frost Queen.
- My mom used to tell me stories about the Frost Queen.
- That can't be it.
- Either way, let's download and get out.
- It's encrypted. It's encrypted.
- But I have a program that can hack it.
- And then we can download it.
- Right.
- Quickly.
- [PHONE BEEPS]
- Wait a minute. Oh, crap.
- What?
- It's Sarah.
- But it's... I thought she was sexting, dude.
- She's here with Casey, and they're in trouble.
- What do we do? Call Beckman.
- Beckman or CIA or the Marines, because someone's gotta save them.
- Who's gonna save them?
- We are.
- Marco: Enough with the toes.
- No one's coming.
- I would love nothing more than to put b*ll*ts in both your heads.
- Yeah, go ahead and do it. Don't jabber, just do it.
- The problem is you're not the two agents I'm looking for.
- In the past six months, two CIA agents... have gotten closer to Volkoff Industries than any other spy.
- They're ghosts.
- They expertly use public transportation to avoid being tracked.
- So tell me... who are these master spies?
- No idea.
- Never seen them.
- Chuck: Morgan, this way.
- [g*n COCK]
- Back, back, back.
- [g*n COCK]
- MAN [OVER RADIO]: Got them. They're in the building.
- They're here. They must have come for you.
- Well, that's their first mistake.
- This entire building is a trap.
- So, buddy, how rusty is your kung fu?
- I haven't used it in months.
- Great.
- So you want to speak to your friend?
- Sarah: Chuck, what's going on? What are you doing here?
- I know you must have a lot of questions, and I promise I will explain later.
- You've gotta flash. You've gotta get out.
- I've heard enough.
- This is a mistake. He's not a spy.
- k*ll them.
- No, please, no.
- [g*n OVER RADIO]
- Chuck?
- [SCREAMS OVER RADIO]
- Well, it all seemed a bit anticlimactic.
- I'm gonna tear you limb from limb from limb.
- Okay, I got it. Somebody please sh**t this guy.
- CHUCK [OVER RADIO]: Hello?
- Yes, who is it?
- Chuck: Look, you clearly have no idea who I am.
- You only sent 10 of your men to take care of me.
- So let me break it down: If you touch one hair on Sarah's head... I will do to you what I've just done to your men. Understand?
- I'm coming down there right now.
- Scary enough?
- I'm scared.
- I was scared when you... Rusty? You're not rusty at all. You are limber.
- I suggest you start running, right about now.
- Follow me.
- [GRUNTS]
- [GROANS]
- That hurts. I'm so out of spy shape.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Saving your lives, okay? Let's just go with that for now.
- Ahem, I'm good.
- Cut me free.
- I got some Russians to k*ll.
- Chuck: Not yet.
- There's one more thing I have to do.
- I'm waiting for you, and I don't like to wait.
- MAN [OVER RADIO]: Boss, the Americans have escaped.
- Casey: Chuck, why are we here?
- The computer? This is what you came here for?
- Look, Sarah, I have to tell you the truth.
- I took over my father's search for my mom. She's a spy.
- I thought I could find her, save her, bring her home.
- You should've told me.
- You would've tried to stop me.
- Of course. I don't want you to get hurt.
- Sarah, I have to do this. This is my mom, okay?
- I need to know the truth.
- No lying. That was our rule.
- In all fairness, I was just, you know, keeping a secret. I wasn't lying.
- New rule: No secrets, no lies.
- Starting now.
- Starting now.
- Great, you've made up. How do we get out of here?
- MARCO [OVER RADIO]: You can't get out.
- This is a living building, totally automated.
- The security system is activated.
- If you die, you die.
- That sounds ominous.
- Hope the file was worth it, Chuck. We're sitting ducks in here.
- Sorry, Mom.
- Chuck, what are you doing?
- I set off the EMP.
- It disables the building. We walk out of here.
- But the computer, you'll lose the file. You might never find your mom.
- Yeah, well, it's not worth losing you.
- Any of you.
- Yeah, we get it. Pull the trigger.
- Okay, great. Great plan. Now what?
- Now we deploy the best commie r*fle ever invented, comrade AK-47.
- Move it, move it.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Everybody alive?
- I'm okay, I'm okay. A little cold, but...
- Anyone that matters?
- Where's the getaway car?
- Happy anniversary?
- Happy anniversary.
- [GASPS]
- Chuck: So that's it.
- That's the whole story.
- Well, I'm just peeved you didn't ask us for help.
- I'm sorry.
- Will you help me find my mom?
- Yes.
- Yes, of course. Chuck, you know what this means.
- You're gonna have to rejoin the agency and be a spy.
- I know.
- The question is, do we tell Beckman about my mom?
- No, not yet.
- Chuck, what about your sister? What are you gonna tell Ellie?
- I have to tell her the truth.
- I have to tell her that I am a spy.
- [GASPS]
- Chuck.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
- That's okay.
- How are you?
- The interview didn't go well?
- No, none of them, really.
- There's something that I have to do, Ellie.
- It's okay, Chuck.
- I know.
- What?
- I saw the new Buy More.
- Uh, right, yeah. I did get a job there.
- Ellie, I'm not... That's not...
- It's okay, Chuck. It's a job.
- Those are really hard to come by these days, so...
- My turn. Sit down.
- Okay.
- What's up?
- I'm pregnant.
- What?
- Are you... ? What? Seriously?
- I was gonna wait until Devon got home, but I saw you and I had to tell you.
- Oh, my God. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.
- Oh, my God, I'm so happy for you.
- Oh, my God, I'm hugging you.
- Did I hurt the baby?
- Stop.
- Have I hurt the child?
- Chuck.
- Oh, my God, that's amazing.
- I'm really happy right now, Chuck.
- I mean, I'm starting a family... a new family, and you have Sarah, and you're safe, and just...
- I'm really so happy right now.
- Chuck: I couldn't tell her, not now.
- She doesn't want me to be a spy... but our dad gave me this mission to find our mom, to know the truth.
- I can't not do this. I have to do this.
- That's not being a spy, that's being a brother.
- I cracked into the deep database for your mom... and this is all I could find.
- Look at the top of the page.
- She was captured?
- Yeah.
- And there's nothing else after that.
- This whole time, Ellie and I thought that our mom left us... because she didn't care about us. But she was taken.
- Are you gonna tell Ellie?
- No.
- No, not yet.
- If my mom is still alive, I'm gonna find her and bring her home.
- Why did you bring me here?
- Found out some interesting information about you.
- Someone's looking for you.
- Who?
- Your family.
- Have you told Volkoff anything?
- No, I told him nothing.
- That's good.
- That is very, very good.
- [GRUNTING]
- Wait.
- Please, I have a family.
- So do I.
