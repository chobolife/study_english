# Chuck Versus Operation Awesome

- Hi, I'm Chuck.
- Here are a few things you might need to know.
- Kind of a crazy night.
- One more patient, and I am on my way.
- So, what seems to be the problem?
- (muffled breathing)
- woman: Well, let's have a look at you.
- Where am I?
- Who are you?
- My name is Sydney.
- And...
- (grunts)
- (horns honking)
- Here's where you are.
- Now... I trust we're feeling all right?
- Not too many bumps and bruises?
- After all, we're going to need you in tip-top shape.
- Need me for what?
- Nothing too difficult.
- At least not for one of the CIA's best.
- No, no, no, you got me mixed up with someone else.
- I'm just a doctor.
- We know exactly who you are, Devon.
- (sighs)
- So, please, tell me... what's it like being a world-class spy?
- (car horn honking)
- Chuck, stop freaking out.
- Oh, I'm not freaking out.
- I'll tell you why I'm not freaking out.
- That would require me overreacting, and I don't think it's technically possible for me to overreact to my brother-in-law being kidnapped!
- We're doing the best we can, Chuck.
- Why don't you go upstairs, go to work.
- We'll call you as soon as we have any news.
- Chuck: Look at that... Ellie is making her 50th call to Awesome within the hour, in addition to the 20 that she's made to me already today.
- She's-she's losing it.
- What... what am I supposed to tell her?
- Honestly, Chuck, I think the best thing you can do is to just calm down.
- Here's a little tip, If you really want someone to calm down, never tell them to calm down, because it doesn't work! They don't calm down!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.
- I'm sorry. I'm calming down.
- Here comes the calm.
- I will soon...
- Be calm.
- Not working. I'm not calming down.
- I tell you what... I got an idea.
- I'm going to go to work, and then you guys call me the absolute second that you hear anything about Devon.
- (sighs)
- Big Mike: Calm down, Morgan.
- You got nothing to worry about, son.
- So, you can wipe that concerned look off that...
- Hairy face.
- Yeah, well, it's just... It's a little unusual that you would call me in before I even have time to screw anything up.
- You're right.
- Usually, mornings are Big Mike time.
- Time for reflection and-and pastry.
- But I'll tell you something, son.
- You've become like family to me.
- Oh. Thank you, sir.
- No.
- Thank your mama.
- Woman makes me feel good.
- Real good.
- Like a man should.
- But credit where it's due.
- I've noticed a change in you lately.
- You're commanding more respect from your coworkers.
- You're walking a little taller around here.
- Seems to me...
- You're ready to run with the big dogs.
- Of course.
- Wait, what?
- Morgan, are you ready to be my assistant manager?
- Me, sir?
- I believe in you, son.
- Well?
- Yes.
- Yeah, this will be good.
- One of the big dogs.
- (barks)
- No. Don't do that.
- That's a little dog... Schnauzer or something.
- (deep bark) Big dog.
- Chuck: Hey, Sarah... It's Chuck.
- I had an idea... Delta Force.
- Have you called them yet?
- If not, call me back with their number, okay?
- Lester: Ah. Just in time.
- Need that big brain of yours, Charles.
- Jeff is dead wrong about something.
- Well, that's kind of his default setting, is it not?
- Woman: Excuse me, sir.
- Can you help me?
- I understand you're having a big sale on HDTVs.
- Uh, yes, we are.
- Lester or Jeff here could actually...
- Sarah.
- (sighs)
- Seriously, Charles, it's an emergency here.
- Woman: Young man, you even listening?
- (speaking thai)
- (speaking thai)
- (whimpers) (sighs)
- Excuse me. I'm so sorry.
- I went... That's not what I meant to say.
- (sighs)
- Impressive.
- Now, if Jean-Claude van Damme and Steven Seagal got into a fight, who do you think would win?
- This is your big question?
- Bear in mind that Master Seagal's fighting style choice is aikido... like so...
- "I'm just a cook. "
- "I'm a lowly cook. "
- Come on, buddy!
- Lester: Come on, buddy. Come on.
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- What you got? What you got?
- Boom, boom, pow!
- Okay. I think he'll live, but we need to get you out of here.
- Listen, we think we know who has awesome.
- The last patient that he saw at the hospital was a ring operative.
- What? What, Sarah?
- The ring? Oh, my God.
- This is all my fault.
- I'm the one who got him involved in all this.
- They're probably torturing him as we speak.
- No, there is no reason to think that.
- Yeah, you're right.
- There are hundreds of other nightmare scenarios far worse.
- Uh, Chuck...
- No, don't you understand?
- I'm responsible for this.
- I k\*ll Captain Awesome.
- Oh, my God.
- You're back.
- Thank God.
- Oh, my God, you're back. You're back.
- This is... this is great news.
- This is very good news. Are you okay?
- Tell me you're okay.
- Chuck, they think I'm a spy.
- I'm in trouble here, man.
- They think I'm you.
- (tires screeching)
- (whimpers) from what he has told us, we can conclude that the woman Devon was with is Sydney Prince, the head of a ring cell in Los Angeles.
- She has tried to recruit several of our agents.
- She knows everything about me, Chuck.
- Ellie, too.
- Everything except who the real spy in the family is.
- That's an understandable mistake.
- One of them looks like a spy, and the other one looks... like Chuck.
- True.
- She gave me this.
- She told me she'd contact me with instructions.
- It's a ring communication device, General.
- Exactly. It works off a closed network, but the NSA has recently developed new technology to crack it.
- Now we can put it into use.
- All right. Fantastic news.
- Sounds like a plan.
- I'm going to get awesome back to my sister before she has an aneurysm.
- You can't take him home quite yet, Chuck.
- We still need to talk about how we're going to use Devon.
- Excuse me... What? Oh, no, no.
- No one's using Devon.
- There will be no using of him anymore.
- Okay, no more fun spy games for him, forever.
- Using Devon is our best option.
- Sydney won't go to her superiors with his identity until she definitively knows whether she has turned him or b\*rned him.
- When Sydney contacts him, he'll do what she says just long enough for us to track her, find her and bring her in.
- You mean I have to do what she says?
- No, you don't. No, he doesn't.
- This is my family we're talking about here.
- Come on.
- It's the only way to keep him safe.
- Devon, we'll be with you every step of the way.
- If you tell me you can get me through this, I trust you.
- I will, Devon.
- I promise.
- Morgan: Um, excuse me.
- Stop right there.
- Are you leaving early again, Bartowski?
- Are you serious?
- No, of course not, man. I'm kidding.
- No, I mean, are you being serious?
- Are you seriously wearing that vest right now?
- Ah.
- Big Mike made me... assistant manager.
- And I accepted it.
- Boom.
- Well, congratulations, buddy.
- I'm proud of you.
- Lester: Charles.
- Oh!
- Oh, wow.
- Lester, I'm really sorry about the...
- That was a completely knee-jerk reaction. You know what?
- I'm just going to switch to decaf from now on.
- It's not a problem.
- In fact, I want to thank you.
- You helped me feel something I have not felt in a long time.
- Another human's foot on your body?
- The thrill of being alive.
- What?
- The electrifying sensation of pain coursing through my face was like an adrenaline sh\*t to my soul.
- It made me feel like a man, maybe for the first time since my bar mitzvah.
- I've never had a bar mitzvah.
- Chuck, please.
- I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
- Chuck: I... I think that you two are certifiably disturbed.
- I'm going to go home.
- So... hey.
- Uh, you want a ride home?
- Yeah, I got access to the company car.
- Oh, big man on campus. All right.
- Well, actually, uh, Awesome's at the mall today, and we got to talk about a few things, so I'll see you at home.
- Oh. All right.
- Chuck: You okay, man?
- Captain: No, no, it's Ellie.
- God, Chuck.
- What am I going to tell her about where I've been?
- I'm a terrible liar, man.
- (door opening)
- Devon, is that you?
- (whispering) Remember to keep it simple.
- Simple.
- Oh, thank God.
- I was so worried.
- Yeah, babe, I'm... I'm fine.
- Why didn't you call?
- Um, uh...
- After I got off the overnight, I decided I needed to clear my head.
- So, I went for a run... in Griffith Park.
- No cell phones there.
- Uh-uh. So, I'm running, and I just... I heard something in a tree.
- It was a...
- It's a cat.
- A hurt cat.
- I had to see if it needed medical attention.
- Then, I realized... it's a bear.
- What's a bear? The cat's a bear?
- Yeah, yeah, the cat's a bear.
- It's a... it's a bear, and it... jumps out at me, and it attacks, and it's like...
- It's angry at me for some reason, this bear. (roars)
- Oh, my God!
- You were attacked by a bear?
- Yeah, and I... I... cut off its head.
- Yeah, babe, I... I decapitated the bear.
- In self-defense, in order to survive.
- I'm just glad you weren't there to see it.
- It was really grisly.
- Do you honestly expect me to believe this?
- Because you two think I'm an idiot.
- Is that what you think?
- No, no, no.
- That is not what we think.
- That is not what we think.
- I think that it's time that we tell Ellie the truth.
- Oh, yeah. Thank God, Chuck.
- The truth.
- I'm terrible at this. I'm a terrible liar, honey.
- You know that.
- Clearly.
- Casey was arrested early this morning in Griffith Park.
- He was drunk, super drunk.
- Really blotto.
- Cop's words, not mine.
- He was in bad shape, wasn't he, Devon?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it was bad, hon.
- He wet himself.
- Also exposed himself.
- Anyhow, Devon... spent most of the day, pretty much all day down at the station talking to a buddy of his on the force trying to get the charges dropped, so...
- Oh, my God.
- Really?
- Really.
- (door closes)
- Hey, guys.
- Ugh.
- Uh, let's go inside, Devon.
- (door opens then closes)
- What?
- Nothing.
- (grunts)
- (clears throat)
- Jeff?
- You got a second?
- What's going on here, man?
- I noticed everybody's a little b\*at up.
- The first rule of fight...
- Easy.
- Our friend, Morgan, here is the assistant manager now.
- Oh, guys.
- We've worked together for a long time.
- You know, we're... we're chums.
- Whatever you say.
- Ass man.
- Don't you mean, Mr. Ass man?
- I do not.
- Chuck: I can't believe the ring thinks awesome's a spy.
- This is crazy. This... this is crazy.
- When do you think she's gonna call?
- What do you think she's gonna say?
- What do you think we do when she does call?
- Chuck, the important thing is that Devon will be looking to you as his handler.
- And you need to remember what it felt like to be scared and new to this.
- Yeah, like he'll ever forget that.
- Think of it this way. On this mission, Devon is you and you're her.
- So, be her, Chuck, huh?
- Well, maybe Sydney will never call?
- (knocking on door)
- Captain: Guys.
- Guys, it's me.
- You in there?
- She called.
- What's that?
- Found it on my front step.
- It's from Sydney.
- I gotta open it right away.
- She's gonna call in about five minutes.
- Come on.
- What do you think is in there?
- (beeping) it's okay, answer it.
- Hello?
- From now on, Devon, I will speak to you through the earpiece included in the package.
- And you will speak to me through the watch we sent.
- Now, put in the earpiece, and put on the watch.
- (whispering) Par for the course.
- Just do what she says.
- Okay, putting on the earpiece now. (beeps)
- Now we can track you on our own gps network.
- It's fine.
- Standard operating procedure.
- Be at the crystal towers downtown in one hour.
- Come alone.
- Oh, and, Devon, the earpiece is also an expl\*sive device.
- Remove it, or deviate from my instructions in any way, and I will detonate it, ruining that lovely face of yours.
- Sarah: No.
- Okay, well, that is not standard... at all.
- Captain: Chuck?
- Chuck, it's me. Can you hear me?
- Yes, yes, buddy, yes. I'm... I'm right here.
- And you're sure they can't hear me talking to you?
- They can only hear you if you press the button on their watch.
- An open bug would be far too easy to trace.
- I've labeled the watches so you don't get confused.
- Sarah: Devon, this is Sarah.
- As soon as Sydney calls, Casey's going to start tracking the signal.
- As soon as we've tracked her location, we're going to bring her in and then you're done.
- Whew.
- Okay, good.
- Chuck, this gonna work, right, buddy?
- Remember, if you freak out, he's going to freak out.
- This is absolutely going to work.
- Everything is fine.
- I am very confident.
- (beeping)
- Sydney: Devon?
- Are you ready to begin?
- Ready.
- There is a penthouse on the 12th floor.
- Go there.
- The building has extensive security, but it's nothing that you can't handle.
- We'll talk again once you're there.
- She's close.
- Wasn't on the line long enough to get an exact location.
- Need another call. Another call? !
- No, we can't wait.
- The guy's got an expl\*sive earpiece stuck in his head!
- Chuck, our target is Sydney.
- We need to get her to save him.
- Okay, fine, then you get her, and I'll get awesome up to the 12th floor. buddy, head inside the building and wait.
- Wait? Wait for what?
- (grunts)
- Wait for me.
- Good luck.
- Chuck?
- Chuck, where are you?
- I'm on my way, buddy.
- Here to see someone in the building?
- (panting) Well...
- Yeah.
- Yeah, kinda.
- I'm here to meet... meet my friend.
- Chuck.
- Does this Chuck work here?
- He could work here.
- He might.
- Okay, pal.
- Take it easy.
- I'm building security.
- My name's Julius.
- What's the problem?
- You can tell me.
- (sighs)
- I'm involved in something really messed up, man.
- Been lying to my wife.
- Been lying to everybody.
- I can't take it anymore.
- Because of this Chuck guy?
- Yeah. Yeah, Chuck.
- I think I understand.
- Look, pal, if you really love this Chuck, you have to tell your wife.
- You can't live a lie.
- Trust me, I've been there.
- That's not really what I mean.
- Sure, it isn't.
- (silenced g\*n) (groans)
- Oh!
- Chuck!
- You k\*ll Julius!
- What? k\*ll? ! I would never do that.
- It's a tranq g\*n. (g\*n firing, groans)
- That's preposterous.
- k\*ll someone.
- Come on. Bingo.
- All right, he's going to be fine. Come on.
- So, what do you think is up there?
- Something pretty gnarly, huh?
- It's best not to speculate.
- I mean, nine times out of ten...
- Well, seven...
- You get yourself all worked up over nothing.
- (elevator bell dings)
- See? Nothing to worry about.
- Man: Hey, you're not allowed up here!
- (silenced g\*n)
- (heavy breathing)
- Look out.
- Dude, you're incredible!
- Was that your spy training?
- Duck hunt. Nintendo.
- (beeping)
- Devon?
- Yes, Sydney.
- Good, you're alive.
- Down the hall to your left is an unmarked door.
- The lock works via retina scan.
- Cut out one of the guards' eyes and use it to open the door.
- What?
- We got to cut out one of these guys' eyes for the scan!
- I took an oath, bro.
- I can't cut out a man's eye.
- I got a better idea.
- Captain: (strains) Jeez, this guy's heavy.
- Yeah.
- Well, bad guys don't count carbs, buddy.
- (mechanical whirring)
- (sighs)
- (heavy breathing)
- Sarah, we have reached the 12th floor, but what the heck is going on?
- This is a CIA facility.
- Sarah? Hello?
- Chuck? Hello?
- I lost him.
- (beeping)
- Tracked her. She's...
- She's right here.
- Sarah: That's her.
- (doors, windows clicking) Let's go!
- What the hell? !
- Casey, Walker. Stand down.
- General, we have a visual on Sydney.
- She just walked past us.
- He's heading inside the building.
- I've just received new mission information, colonel.
- Your new directive is to stand down.
- General, Chuck has reached the 12th floor, and he says it's some kind of CIA base.
- If that's true, then this is some kind of a setup.
- Yes, that's exactly what this is.
- Excellent work, Devon.
- You're almost finished.
- There's a man in the office at the end of the hall.
- Chuck, Sydney says there's a man in the office at the end of the hall.
- Find him.
- And k\*ll him.
- Chuck, she wants us to find him and k\*ll him.
- Nobody's going to k\*ll anybody, okay?
- Just calm down and stay close.
- Excuse me, sir?
- Excuse me, I know this is a little awkward, but don't move.
- But also don't be afraid.
- My name is... Chuck.
- Chuck Bartowski.
- I know.
- How... how do you... how do you know that?
- I know things, lots of things, about you, about them.
- What... what do you know about the ring?
- What are they doing here? What do they want?
- Why do they need Devon?
- They don't need anything.
- They already have everything.
- Simple as that.
- Now, Sydney will be here any minute.
- We've got to do this.
- Syd-Sydney's coming here?
- You know she wants me to k\*ll you, right?
- But don't worry, I'm... I'm not gonna do that.
- However, we do need a plan.
- I've got one.
- You're going to k\*ll me, Chuck.
- What? No.
- No, no, no, no. I don't k\*ll people.
- Okay? I have rules against such things.
- sh\*\*t me. Here.
- Try to be precise.
- Are you listening to anything I'm saying right now?
- I don't k\*ll people.
- Therefore, I don't sh\*\*t them.
- Maybe with a tranq g\*n. I'll tranq anybody you want.
- But a g\*n. I hate g\*n.
- Listen, if you don't k\*ll me now, you and Devon are as good as dead.
- Well, I'm not gonna do it!
- Chuck.
- I have to die. Now.
- The ring knows too much.
- There's no other way.
- So, just do it.
- sh\*\*t me.
- (heavy breathing)
- I... I... I can't do it.
- I can't do it.
- Afterward, put the g\*n in Devon's hands, then hide.
- When she's leaves, open this.
- Truth is, I hate g\*n, too.
- Who are you?
- (gasps, body thuds)
- Chuck!
- Huh? What?
- What, no, I didn't... No!
- That's not me, I didn't sh\*\*t him, I swear!
- He's dead.
- Chuck, this is not a tranq g\*n.
- (door opening)
- (footsteps approaching)
- Okay, listen to me.
- Remember, you sh\*t him.
- g\*n?
- Take off the watch.
- Well done.
- Cute and talented.
- (beeps)
- What a catch.
- (sighs)
- Lose the body, keep the phone.
- We'll be in touch.
- Welcome to the ring.
- (exhaling loudly)
- Chuck, Chuck, what the hell is going on right now?
- "Med Kit in desk. The pill was amiodarone. "
- "Save me"?
- Amiodarone.
- Amiodarone stops your heart, only momentarily though.
- If it's a clean sh\*t I think I can save him.
- Here.
- (gasping)
- (groaning)
- To answer your question, my name is Shaw.
- I would like to introduce you all to CIA Special Agent Daniel Shaw.
- For the last five years, he has worked on nothing but taking out the ring.
- From this point on, Agent Shaw has total command authority on any mission having anything to do with the ring.
- Really? This guy? I have back issues of g\*n & a\*mo older than he is.
- Be that as it may, you should all know that I've been fully briefed on the details of the Intersect.
- That's right. I know everything.
- Thank you very much, general.
- I'll take it from here.
- Colonel, Walker, Chuck, you're in good hands.
- Good luck.
- Here's an overview of current ring intel.
- Great, welcome to the team.
- But Sydney is still out there, which means my brother-in-law's still in danger.
- Not for long.
- As you've seen, the ring operates through a network of decentralized cells.
- If we catch Sydney, there's a good chance we can contain Devon's identity.
- He's a bona fide mole in their operation.
- In order to save him, we have to use him.
- What? No! No way!
- I've already been over this.
- Devon is out of the spy business for good.
- Chuck, as long as Sydney is alive, Devon is a marked man.
- She's right, Chuck.
- Casey, Sarah, please!
- Explain the risks to him.
- The risks are greater for Devon if we don't use him.
- Sydney would sooner k\*ll him than let him go.
- Well, I don't care.
- He's not a spy.
- Well, Chuck, then I guess the question is, Do you have a better plan?
- Morgan: Where in the hell is everyone?
- (distant cheering and shouting)
- What is that?
- (grunting and cheering)
- A fight club?
- No, no!
- No! We cannot have this, guys!
- Come on, there's, you know, insurance issues.
- (crowd booing)
- Who's next? !
- Who wants to regain their manhood?
- Lester, come on, man, we talked about this. We can't have this anymore.
- You have to cut this out!
- You can. (crowd cheers)
- It's like I'm talking to a wall.
- (crowd cheering)
- Lester, a little help, please.
- No, no!
- Let me out of here! Let me out of here!
- No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here!
- Morgan: Don't... (electrical crackling)
- Don't... Do not hook that up.
- I'm trying to help them.
- (screaming)
- Okay, no, no!
- Hey, listen to me, back to work!
- All right, fight club is over!
- Lester: Over?
- Nothing's over till we say it's over.
- You may have shut this down, but you will never shut us down.
- Ass man.
- (snaps fingers)
- Yeah. Oh.
- (electrical crackling) Nice.
- You could at least unplug the battery!
- (knocking) Hey.
- What's up? Everything okay?
- Please don't say another mission, Chuck.
- I can't take this anymore.
- I'm kind of freaking out.
- Don't worry, no. No more missions.
- I'm sorry that I put you through all this but I promised you that I would take care of it, and I am.
- Give me the phone.
- Thanks.
- Morgan: Chuck, you in there?
- Oh, there you are.
- Been looking all over for you.
- Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
- 'Cause I'm in a crisis.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so am I.
- Yeah, of course you are.
- My man, still working.
- An assistant manager's dream.
- On to my nightmare.
- Uh, Lester turned the cage into a fight club and attached a battery to the fence so he can shock people.
- (inhales deeply)
- You smell that?
- That's burnt human hair, dude.
- I told them to stop and no one will listen to me.
- Okay, no one will listen to anything that I have to say.
- My job is on the line here.
- Yeah, well, it sounds like you need a plan, buddy.
- Exactly. That's exactly what I need.
- Dude, I was thinking, I was, like, you know, I probably need a plan here but what plan?
- You know?
- (beeping)
- You know... you know sometimes what I like to do is-is, uh, open up a problem and really examine it.
- Find its weak points.
- And then not be afraid to just attack it head-on.
- Wow.
- Wow.
- That's some powerful stuff.
- Yeah, I think that'll work.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, buddy.
- (beeping)
- Sydney: How did you activate this phone?
- Who is this?
- I'm the spy who k\*ll Agent Shaw.
- This is not Devon Woodcomb.
- Yeah, well, you've been dealing with the wrong man.
- Devon was a decoy.
- I'm the one who put that b\*llet through Agent Shaw's chest last night.
- I'm the spy that you're looking for.
- And I am in charge of this mission now.
- Hey, hey, Sarah, uh, it's Chuck.
- Don't be mad at me, but I may or may not have called Sydney on the ringphone so she would track me here to the buy more.
- It's a trap, my trap.
- You told Sydney to go to the buy more?
- Oh, my God, it worked. They're here.
- Okay, grab Casey and get up here so we can take them out.
- No, Chuck, what are you, crazy?
- Not very smart, Chuck.
- This is not how I do business.
- You start things on your own, you better be prepared to finish them...
- On your own.
- Good luck.
- He hung up on me.
- Casey: What are you doing?
- Without us, he doesn't have a chance.
- He's gonna start to panic and then he's not gonna be able to perform properly.
- Yeah, happens to lots of guys.
- Or so I hear.
- Besides, I'm kinda curious about what his plan is.
- Chuck: This isn't part of the plan.
- Oh, this is very, very bad.
- Chuck: (over PA) Hello, Sydney.
- Welcome to the Burbank Buy More.
- Please proceed directly to the home theater room.
- Find him.
- I would suggest the best way of getting to the home theater room is through the mp3/... aisle, but beware...
- You break it, you buy it.
- Hello, sir.
- Store's closed at the moment but if you want to come back in the morning, we'll be open around 10:00...
- You're signing his death warrant, you know that, don't you?
- Ye of little faith.
- This is crazy.
- I'm going in.
- So am I.
- I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you two to stand down.
- I don't like g\*n much, but when necessary, I will use them.
- Finally, we meet.
- In an electronics store.
- Which is different.
- No matter.
- When we last chatted, you mentioned a certain Agent Shaw.
- That's right.
- Because I'm the one who ended Shaw's life, not Devon Woodcomb. He was just a patsy.
- You took out Shaw?
- Mr. Buy More?
- In a nutshell.
- I mean, that's kind of what happened.
- Well, then, if that's true, you won't have any problem with Glen and Ian here.
- Glen and Ian?
- Sure.
- Well, you should know, Glen and Ian, Ian and Glen, that if you take one more step, I will drop you.
- (whispering) Oh, come on, flash. Flash!
- (Chuck groans)
- (gasps) Okay. Okay, now I'm angry.
- I'm angry and in a great deal of pain.
- (panting)
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh...
- (high-pitched, martial arts cries)
- Get him.
- That was his plan?
- You know what? I'm going in. sh\*\*t me if you have to.
- (g\*n chamber clicks)
- Casey: Hey!
- (sighs)
- You're fast.
- Something else you should know about me... I love g\*n.
- Good boy.
- (grunts)
- Go! I got these guys.
- Sydney: Check the cage.
- Oh!
- (g\*n chamber clicks)
- (groaning)
- (grunting)
- (groans)
- (grunting)
- (grunting)
- (panting)
- (g\*n chamber clicks)
- (sighs)
- (grunts)
- Stop! Do not move!
- (panting)
- Or what? Hmm?
- Please, just do what I say.
- (sighs)
- Spies don't say please.
- Now, Devon...
- He would have had a b\*llet between my eyes by now.
- All right, fine, your choice... Live or die.
- (panting)
- That's better.
- What are you doing? Do not do that.
- Do not do that!
- It's just the phone.
- You do want it, don't you?
- Or if you can't think of a use for it, I'm sure I can.
- I can make a phone call and have 50 operatives here.
- Don't make me sh\*\*t you.
- I don't think you can.
- Sarah: Chuck!
- (g\*n)
- (body thuds, b\*llet casings clatter)
- Like I said, I hate g\*n, but it pays to know how to use one.
- Suppose congratulations are in order, Chuck.
- Devon's identity has been contained.
- We got lucky this time, Shaw.
- Yeah, and risked my family doing it.
- There's something you need to know about me, Shaw.
- There's nothing in my life that I care about more than my friends and my family.
- Of course, I don't expect you to understand that.
- Being the spy that you are, I'm sure that you don't care about anybody.
- Families and friends make us vulnerable.
- Make us unable to pull the trigger.
- And that puts everyone in even greater danger.
- Just ask your partner here.
- She'll tell you the same thing.
- Sometimes it helps to know that you've got something to lose.

- (singsongy) \* Morgan! \*

♪ Morgan! ♪
♪ Come out and play-ay! ♪
- (laughter)
- Big Mike: Grimes!
- Get over here!
- You have got to get your house in order, son.
- I know. I know I do.
- I... I just... I don't... I don't get it.
- I thought we were all friends here.
- You ain't.
- First rule of Big Mike management, "You can't be afraid"
- "to pull the trigger".
- Right?
- Pull the trigger.
- Right.
- Lester, you know, a wise man once told me that you need to assess a problem and then attack it head-on.
- Hmm.
- You... are a problem.
- Oh.
- Your behavior will no longer be tolerated.
- So, here are the first, second and third rules of the Buy More.
- Do what you're told, do it with respect, or...
- Or what?
- Hmm?
- You'll fight me?
- (laughter)
- (laughing)
- No, I'll fire you.
- You don't have the cojones.
- Yeah.
- No, you're fired.
- Pack your hard drives and get out of here.
- The rest of you, back to work.
- Morgan, Morgan, Morgan, Morgan, come on, man.
- Okay, look, hey.
- We're just having a little fun.
- Okay? I take it back.
- I take it back.
- Good bye, Lester.
- Dude, don't do this. Don't do this, okay?
- You know I need this job. I got to get out of my mom's place.
- Hmm.
- For God's sake, man, I've got nowhere else to go!
- I've got nowhere else to go!
- Yeah, okay, you're rehired.
- (sighs) but you're on probation.
- Okay.
- Double-secret.
- Double-secret? !
- Strong.
- Real strong.
- (barks)
- Was that... ?
- A bigger dog, a medium-sized dog.
- Bigger?
- (knocking on door)
- Morgan: Hey, Chuck, can you grab that, dude?
- I'm-I'm wokin' and rollin' over here.
- Hi-dilly-ho, neighbors.
- Hi.
- Morgan: Yeah, hey, guys.
- Welcome to our... formerly-your... home.
- I hope everybody is hungry, because I made my teriyaki surprise.
- The surprise is the teriyaki.
- Think I've had enough surprises lately.
- Oh, Devon, stop it.
- I'm sure we'll love it, Morgan.
- Mostly sure.
- Hey, uh, buddy, that thing that we were dealing with?
- It's been taken care of.
- We caught her.
- Everything's gonna be just fine.
- (sighs)
- Oh.
- There... there it is. That's enough of that.
- Hey, what-what am I, chopped scallions over here?
- There's no love for buy more's new assistant manager, or... ?
- What? That's great.
- Congratulations.
- Assistant manager?
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Honey, you're hurting him. Put him down.
- Oh. (knocking on door)
- Oh, uh, El, I hope you don't mind, but I... I invited Sarah, as well.
- Oh, really? I'll get the door.
- (clears throat) Oh, Casey, too.
- What? !
- Hi, Ellie.
- Hi, Sarah.
- Good to see you.
- Hello, Ellie.
- Casey.
- You've had enough of that.
- (whispers) What's with her?
- No idea.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- It wouldn't have been the same without you, so, I'm really glad you made it.
- Me, too.
