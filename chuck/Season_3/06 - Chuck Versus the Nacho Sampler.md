# Chuck Versus the Nacho Sampler

- Devon is out of the spy business for good.
- Please don't say another mission, Chuck.
- You're back!
- I'm Hannah.
- If you ever find yourself in Burbank, my assistant manager owes me about a million and a half favors.
- ♪ ♪ stop the presses!
- Who is that? Vicky Vale...
- ♪ Vicky Vale! Vick, uh, Vicky Vale! ♪
♪ vibby-doo-dibby-doo, Vicky Vale! Vick, uh, Vicky v... ♪
- do you remember when Sarah first walked into the Buy More?
- What was it like?
- Was it love at first sight?
- ♪ ♪
- I don't know, but whatever it was, it changed my life forever. Why?
- No reason.
- Morning, guys.
- Hi.
- Hey. Morning.
- All right, everybody, back to work!
- Real taskmaster, that, uh, Morgan.
- Yeah, I can tell.
- So, my first day as a nerd herder... any advice?
- Oh.
- Uh, let's see, well, let's start with the five-cent tour, shall we?
- I like to consider myself the Jack Hannah of this untamed wilderness.
- Me, safe; everyone else, very dangerous.
- Yeah, a little creepy.
- But I am sure that you will protect me.
- Indeed, indeed.
- You stay by us, sister; You'll be safe.
- Charles.
- Hannah, Lester, Jeff.
- Two of the finest members of our buy moron staff.
- Hannah, namaste.
- Nice.
- All right, why don't we give Jeff an opportunity to realize that he's in public?
- Thank you.
- So, I was going through the nerd herd manual last night, and I have a few questions about how to file an install.
- Let me get this straight.
- You went over the nerd herd manual in your off time?
- Are you gonna be a problem employee?
- Look, I know this isn't my dream job, but I thought that while I'm here, I would be the best nerd herder you have.
- Well, as you probably saw, that's not an insurmountable goal.
- You must be pretty committed, going to Paris on an install?
- Yeah, uh, uh...
- Um, you know, about... about t h-that whole Paris thing... can we just keep that between the two of us?
- I don't want everyone else getting jealous...
- Yogurt time.
- Oh, is it... is it yogurt time already?
- Uh, yogurt, most important meal of the day.
- But don't worry, I will give you the full Chuck Bartowski tutorial when I get back, I promise.
- I'm gonna totally hit that.
- May the best stalker win.
- Oops.
- Hey, where's Shaw?
- Off grid on a covert mission.
- It's not your concern where Agent Shaw is, Mr. Bartowski.
- Oh, uh, that's actually Agent Bartowski no w- I don't know if you heard,  but I completed my first solo mish last week.
- Paris. International op.
- But I guess you probably have been briefed.
- We've traced a large sum of money from an offshore ring account into a civilian account.
- I want to know why.
- What's the money for?
- The civilian's name is Manoosh Depak.
- Trained as a computer engineer, dropped out of mit after his freshman year.
- Classic geek tragedy.
- Sound familiar?
- We sent a virus that destroyed the cpu of his custom computer and bought up every series eight cpu within 30 miles.
- He'll come into the Buy More to replace it.
- Develop him as an asset, Agent Bartowski.
- Find out what he's doing for the ring.
- That's it? That's the whole... mission?
- I'll have it done by lunch.
- Don't get cocky, Bartowski.
- One mish does not an Agent make.
- Chuck, you-you can't take this lightly.
- Developing an asset is very tricky business.
- You need to insinuate yourself into their life and have them trust you completely, knowing that one day you're probably gonna have to burn them.
- The trick is to find the hole in their life and fill it.
- With this Manoosh loser, he's a loner, friendless.
- And the asset has entered the store.
- Showtime, Bartowski.
- Don't worry, guys.
- Piece of cake.
- "Mish. "
- Chuck's not ready for an asset.
- We're advancing him too quickly.
- I'm worried.
- Your job's not to worry, it's to train.
- Three o'clock.
- He's with the newest buy moron.
- Can I help you, sir?
- Chuck, I got it.
- No, really, let me help.
- She's new here, still in training.
- Actually, I'd rather have her help me.
- No, Chuck, I'm ready.
- I can handle a simple sale. It's okay.
- Hannah, no sales are simple.
- But don't worry, you will get your chance to shine as soon as you are ready.
- Okay.
- Ah, sorry about that.
- Alone at last.
- What can I do you for?
- Nothing.
- Now that you ruined my flow with that hottie.
- Let me ring you up personally.
- Uh, are you from around here? Is that a Burbankian accent I detect?
- Woodland hills.
- See? I knew I heard the familiar twang of the San Fernando valley.
- Your eyes are hypnotic. Chestnut? Hazel?
- Get a room, Bartowski. You're not asking him out on a date. You know, I think I'll just get the cpu somewhere else.
- Wait, wait, wait! No, no. Uh...
- You-you should just take it, you should take it.
- What do you mean?
- It's on the house, for the inconvenience earlier with the hottie.
- You sure? I mean... isn't that illegal?
- It's on me. My pleasure.
- Chuck, ease up ... you're coming on a little strong.
- Here's my card, just in case you have any other computer problems, or if you want to chat, you know, rap a little.
- Thanks.
- Idiot.
- I'm not trying to pressure you, you know.
- No biggie. You have my card. If you call, you call.
- It's okay! Keep going!
- I'll hold them off!
- Call me!
- I stand corrected.
- He's not ready.
- Thank you.

- Yeah, just caught up in this...
- Fascinating article on...
- Kidney failure.
- You've been really jittery lately.
- Ever since the generalissimo's party, you haven't been acting like yourself.
- Well... I just haven't been sleeping lately.
- Nothing to worry about.
- You don't rock climb anymore, you never work out.
- You just... lay around and watch TV all day.
- It's like I'm married to Morgan.
- I pulled a hammie, I'll have you know.
- I'll be back on the bike in no time.
- Can I ask you a question about Chuck?
- Ai!
- Oh!
- Yeah. Um, but he's your brother.
- I mean, can't imagine I can tell you anything about him.
- Well, did you know he went to Paris last week?
- I found this claim ticket for Charles de gaulle airport in his luggage.
- Yeah, yeah, uh, he mentioned it.
- Mentioned it?
- Why wouldn't he say anything to me?
- He's always wanted to go to Paris.
- Did he see the eiffel tower?
- Yeah, he did.
- No, he didn't.
- I don't know.
- Damn it, I am late for my rounds.
- Got to run.
- No, Devon, wait a minute.
- There's something you're not telling me.
- What's going on?
- Going on? What, like a conspiracy?
- You're freaking, babe.
- You are hiding something! What is it?
- That I love you.
- Which I'm not hiding.
- Let's talk about this later.
- There are kidneys failing as we speak.
- Devon...
- De...
- What are you doing Friday?
- You want to hang in my van?
- What about Thursday? And I'm disease-free.
- I don't think Mr. Barnes here can say the same.
- That was low. All's fair, kiddo.
- Yeah, I think that I'm pretty booked up this week, you guys.
- Hannah, Hannah, could I see you for a second?
- Remember what I said: Me, safe; Everyone else, very, very dangerous.
- So, how'd you like to start phase one of the Bartowski tutorial?
- Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
- Yogurt time.
- Most important meal of the day.
- Uh, we'll talk later. What about the tutorial?
- Lesson number one: Never work hungry.
- "Very dangerous, " huh?
- Morgan, buddy, hey, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah. Would you mind keeping an eye on Hannah?
- The vultures are circling.
- Oh, boy. Sure.
- Lester, Jeff.
- What, now? Can I see you both in my office, please?
- You have an office?
- There we go.
- What happened to all the brooms and bleach?
- I just, uh, move 'em in and out every morning.
- Gentlemen, have a seat, please.
- Okay. It is my duty as assistant manager to tell you there'll be no dating in the workplace.
- Yeah? You dated Anna.
- It's my constitutional right to fornicate.
- Okay.
- Here's the thing.
- I like her.
- Okay? I'm just asking you guys to, you know, lay off.
- Fine, but I get to sleep over with you and Chuck twice a week.
- Okay.
- You?
- Next hire...
- I want you to find me a wife.
- A woman of color, preferably padma lakshmi.
- Done.
- One condition.
- You men are both excellent stalkers.
- I need you to use your k\*ll set and find out everything there is to know about Hannah, okay?
- Likes, dislikes...
- Everything.
- Consider her stalked.
- Okay, credit card charges, mostly video games, comic books.
- Phone records indicate only one female call in the last year... sister.
- I feel so sorry for this gu y- he seems so lonely.
- Oh, whoops.
- That's your old file, Bartowski.
- Sorry about that.
- Ah, here we go.
- Oddly similar.
- Battlestar Galactica, dune,  nacho sampler... sounds like your dream date.
- The problem was, Chuck, that you came on too strong.
- You never want to seem like you're making advances.
- You always want the other person to feel like they're in control. Here.
- Thank you. So, uh, that first day you came into the Buy More, when we first met, what did they tell you about me? What do you think?
- You hadn't had a date in over a year, and they don't waste the blondes on just anyone.
- Uh, it hadn't been a year.
- Okay? Thanks.
- They thought you and I could connect.
- I remember you left me your card so I could call you so we could go out.
- Felt like I was having the luckiest day of my life.
- God, I was pathetic.
- No, you were sweet and innocent. I liked you.
- It made it much harder.
- Why?
- Hey, sap's on his way to the bar. Let's go.
- ♪ ♪
- wow. The last man. Incredible book.
- The greatest literary achievement of our generation.
- Hey, you're that guy from the store today.
- Oh, yeah.
- Sorry about that. We had a bet going to see who could get a customer to steal something from the store.
- I won.
- I knew it. Something like that had to be going on in order for that hot chick to want to wait on me.
- You don't need a 160 iq to figure that out.
- Boost his ego, Chuck.
- She, uh, probably liked you.
- No way.
- The usual.
- We're all out of the nacho sampler tonight, Manoosh.
- Last one is right there.
- We stole all the guac from the kitchen.
- Remember, the nacho sampler is his favorite dish.
- Go ahead. Help yourself.
- Thanks, um...
- Chuck.
- Can I buy you a beer, Chuck?
- All right, here we go. What'd you find out about Hannah?
- Um, she is out of your league.
- She's a sophisticated, classy kind of broad.
- Yeah. She eats Sushi...
- With chopsticks and without the rice.
- Wow.
- I copied her iTunes and iphone playlists.
- She listens to classical music.
- Oh, boy. Tchaikovsky's swan Lake is her most-played,  and she likes french cinema.
- And foreign films.
- Sorry, my friend, even with us spying on her, you do not stand a chance.
- ♪ ♪ you're doing good. Keep it personal.
- Anyway, so my dad was a physicist, right, but he cracked, so when I saw myself going down that same road, I quit, dropped out of Stanford.
- That's exactly what happened to me, except I dropped out of mit.
- Huh. I knew I could tell a fellow underachieving, underappreciated man of intellect.
- Great, two geeks in a pod.
- What are you suggesting? That Buy More is not an impressive enough career choice?
- It's okay.
- All the doubters will be sorry soon enough.
- They don't understand guys like us.
- I got something big planned.
- This is it. Move in.
- Gently, Chuck. Don't push him.
- Uh, how, how so?
- What are you, uh, what are you working on?
- Work... won't leave me alone.
- Hello.
- Guys, he's got a ring phone.
- I'll run a trace.
- Whoa, slow down, chief.
- Yes, I have the prototype.
- Still have some kinks to work out.
- Look, I gotta go. I'm with a friend.
- Sorry about that.
- These guys, they're a little high-strung.
- Yeah.
- Act all tough, you know?
- Think they're intimidating with their secret phones.
- Ooh... scary.
- Signal just bounced back three miles away.
- Ring's tracking him. We got about five minutes before they get here, tops.
- Time to send in a pro. You're up, Walker.
- So, you were talking about your job?
- I'm doing something w\*apon.
- But that's really all I can say.
- I want to tell you, believe me, I do.
- ♪ ♪ what the hell is she doing in here?
- I got this!
- You weren't moving fast enough. Had to send in a closer.
- The ring will be here any minute.
- That hot chick just smiled at me.
- Oh, my gosh, she's coming over here. What do I do?
- Just, just play it cool. Let her come to you.
- Is this what cool people do?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just, you know, kinda... put out the vibe.
- Make a move, Walker. We're wasting time.
- Excuse me. Is this seat taken?
- Help him out, Chuck.
- Uh. .
- No, it's not. It's not taken.
- He was actually saving it for you, I believe.
- Thank you.
- Sarah.
- Manoosh.
- The ring's here.
- Get him out back now!
- Manoosh, come here.
- Where?
- Closer.
- You got something on your lip.
- Let me take it off.
- You get him. I'm gonna get the briefcase.
- They're heading in! Hurry up!
- I want him alive.
- Looks like our friend Manoosh here had one too many.
- Wow, this is the best night of my life.
- Nice job, Walker.
- Another geek bites the dust.
- Wake up, baby.
- Hi.
- Where am I?
- My bedroom. What, you don't remember?
- Guess you had one too many drinks, loverboy.
- Did we... you know?
- Yes, and it was amazing.
- Oh! It was so intense, we both just passed out.
- I've never even spoken to a woman as beautiful as you before.
- Why'd you choose me?
- Because there's something just so mysterious about you and sexy.
- And you were telling me about your top secret work, and secrets turn me on...
- It's a w\*apon!
- A new technology that'll change everything.
- Tell me more.
- Okay, but first, I don't really remember much from last night.
- Can we do it again so I'll never forget?
- Guys, this isn't working.
- Is he gonna be okay?
- 'Cause that's, like, the fifth tranq dart that he's taken.
- How many can a normal person handle?
- As many as it takes for him to tell us what he's building for the ring. They're "twilight" tranqs, Chuck.
- They don't do permanent damage.
- They just make you forget what happened in the last five minutes.
- Well, he's my asset.
- I should've handled this.
- Looks like he's ready for round six...
- Whoa-whoa, take it easy, Tranqenstein.
- Hello.
- Chuck, it's Manoosh.
- Hey, Manizzle. How you doing, buddy?
- How was last night?
- I can't really remember, but judging by the fact that I'm hal f-naked in her bedroom right now, I've gotta say you are singlehandedly the best wingman in the world!
- Well, thanks, buddy. What can I say?
- I do have my k\*ll sets.
- Listen, um, you didn't happen to come across a briefcase at the mexican restaurant, did you?
- My entire life's work's in there.
- Kinda freaking out.
- No, no, no, no, your wingman saw that you left said briefcase and picked it up for you.
- Oh, thank you, Chuck. Look, I've got a flight to catch.
- Do you think you can meet me at the Buy More in about a half an hour?
- Half hour? Not a problem.
- Great. Thanks.
- Sarah...
- You in there?
- Oh...
- No, no, no!
- Langley said don't open it.
- They're sending their own hazmat team.
- But we don't have time to wait, Casey.
- Get your hand off of that.
- Hmm, comic book, glasses, shirt...
- Bingo.
- Guys, I'm not flashing.
- Whatever it is, it's not in the intersect.
- Oh!
- Easy, Bartowski.
- We don't know what this is.
- You think it could be a b\*mb?
- I don't know.
- But we're not gonna find out the hard way.
- Okay, just meet Manoosh at the Buy More, and give him back the briefcase, and act like nothing happened.
- Wait. What? Don't we need to replace it or something before we do that?
- I mean, imagine what the ring is gonna do to him if they find out he doesn't have it!
- Just don't think about it, Chuck.
- It makes being a spy a lot easier.
- Dude, dude, I am freaking out.
- What? Come here. Come here.
- Ellie found a baggage ticket from your Paris mission.
- I didn't know what to say, so I told her you were on a work trip.
- I can't do this anymore. I cannot lie to my wife. I have to tell her the truth.
- Look, you need to calm down, okay?
- You cannot tell her anything.
- I don't think you realize the gravity of the situation that you are in, but you know my secret, and there are strings attached to that.
- What strings?
- If Ellie finds out, your lives are never gonna be the same.
- They're gonna stick you both in Witness Protection, and I don't think that you want that.
- Look, buddy, I understand that the lying is very difficult at this point right now, but trust me, it gets easier.
- Get down! Get down!
- Hey, hey, Ellie.
- Hi. Um...
- What's going on?
- Chuck, look, I know that we're older, and we don't have to tell each other everything, but I found out about Paris.
- And I just... I don't know.
- When did we start keeping secrets from each other?
- Well, the thing is I was, I was gonna tell you.
- Um, it was a business trip.
- This very eccentric customer came into the Buy More and insisted that I do a home theatre install in his flat in Paris.
- So why keep that from me?
- Well, because I did such a good job, he said I could use his flat for free for a week.
- And I figured, well, you know, maybe you and Devon could use a proper honeymoon.
- And I wanted it to be a surprise.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Chuck, that is the sweetest thing!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry that I thought you were keeping secrets from me.
- Told ya he's ready. Kid's a good liar.
- You taught him well, Walker.
- Please, Ellie, brother-sister, there are no secrets between us.
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bro, that was so cold-blooded.
- How could you just lie to her like that?
- Ellie and I aren't kids anymore, all right?
- There are some things she's better off not knowing.
- Manizzle.
- Thanks, Chuck.
- You are a lifesaver.
- Hey, what are friends for, right?
- We are friends, aren't we?
- Well, when I get back from this trip, I am going to be rich.
- And then I'll start a company of my own, and then we can work together.
- Don't worry, I won't forget you.
- Hello. No, I told you, I'm still working the kinks out.
- Calm down.
- You'll give yourself a heart attack.
- Who was that?
- The putzes who hired me. You know, I found out they're paying me peanuts compared to what I can get on the open market. But I'm no fool.
- Anyway...
- Thanks, buddy.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Um, uh...
- Before you go, let me get you some yogurt.
- Because, you know, you can't travel on an empty stomach.
- So stay here. I'll be right back.
- Okay, all right.
- Not picking up any sign of ordnance.
- Definitely not a b\*mb.
- Guys, guys, we need to help Manoosh, okay?
- The ring's gonna track him down, and if he doesn't give that thing back to them, they're gonna hurt him or worse.
- Cry me a River.
- He's building a w\*apon.
- He's no innocent.
- He's served his purpose. That's what an asset is.
- Conduit to information, nothing more.
- No more ducking us, Manoosh.
- Take us to your lab.
- We want our w\*apon.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Found something.
- What is that?
- Anthrax? Agent orange?
- Okay, guys, fine.
- Just, uh...
- Just let me put my shades on real quick.
- It's really bright out.
- U. V. protection... very important these days.
- Shaving cream.
- It was a decoy.
- Then where is the w\*apon?
- They found Manoosh.
- He doesn't know who he's dealing with. They're gonna k\*ll him.
- That's not the w\*apon.
- Manoosh is the w\*apon.
- He built a new intersect.
- How did Manoosh build an intersect?
- I thought my dad was the only one who knew how to do that.
- Well, after 2. 0 intersect was destroyed, the ring lifted certain burnt components from a CIA warehouse.
- Manoosh must have reverse engineered it.
- We need to find Manoosh before the ring does.
- He mentioned getting rich.
- That he was going to sell it to the highest bidder.
- I got something.
- Manoosh just used his credit card to book a flight to Dubai.
- Why? What's in Dubai?
- Weap-con.
- The greatest w\*apon convention in the world.
- I go every year. I find it incredibly relaxing.
- Looks like I'll get to write this year's off as a business trip.
- Come in.
- Hey, Morgan.
- Uh, Jeff said you wanted to see me?
- I did, I did, yeah. Nothing urgent. I just wanted to see how the Buy More's treating you.
- "Swan Lake. "
- It's my favorite.
- Mine, too.
- Sans respirer's a classic.
- I must have seen it like ten times.
- 12. Yeah, I can't get enough of french new wave.
- Huh.
- Oh, have a seat, have s seat.
- It's amazing how much we have in common.
- Right? Yeah.
- I just... I love international cinema.
- It's not just the cinema, it's the people and the culture.
- Right? Uh, boy...
- Sadly, too many of my colleagues think that Burbank is the center of the world.
- Yeah, Chuck had never been to Paris until last week on that install.
- Chuck went to Paris?
- Oh, uh, right, I forgot, Chuck told me to keep it quiet.
- Everything's a little secret around here.
- But of course, you know, as you are the assistant manager.
- Right, I am, of course, sure.
- I know everything about Chuck.
- Well, do you mind telling me what goes on over at that yogurt store?
- Because, um, um...
- He is...
- Okay, constantly running over there.
- Yogurt store?
- Yes. Uh, his ex works there.
- He's having trouble letting go.
- Um, Morgan, hey, uh...
- What was it that you wanted to talk to me about?
- Nothing.
- Paris.
- Where else has he gone?
- Welcome to weap-con.
- Bienvenidos, bonjour, as-salaam alaikum.
- a\*mo can be found in the West pavilion.
- expl\*sive and short-range m\*ssile are...
- Deadly pens. I've got exploding pens, laser pens...
- Hey! Casey, no shopping. We're here to find Manoosh.
- You sir, what kind of pen do you want?
- How much for the laser pen?
- Behold this beauty.
- The em-50 mobile interrogation unit.
- The most exclusive one of its kind, the em-50 is nearly impossible to escape from.
- You don't have time to get a prisoner to Gitmo, but you need to extract vital information, this is your unit.
- The presentation on stage four is about to begin.
- Ladies...
- Please, have a seat, get situated.
- Huh?
- Ladies, gentlemen, warlords, sheiks and huns.
- I see some huns back there, don't I?
- Welcome to the future of warfare and w\*apon.
- I have before me the most powerful w\*apon known to mankind.
- That w\*apon, you ask...
- Is me!
- At this time yesterday, I was a pathetic weakling.
- These bikini babes wouldn't even spit on me.
- I have no muscle, terrible allergies and am completely uncoordinated, but...
- Behold me now.
- Moments ago, I was a 100-pound weakling.
- Now a deadly kung fu expert.
- Laugh if you will.
- Do I have any volunteers?
- Maybe one of you apes thinks they can kick my ass.
- Step back, ladies.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Imagine an entire army of men like me.
- No training involved.
- Just throw these glasses on any civilian and voila, an army of instant warriors.
- So call your banks, your kings, your dignitaries or what have you, 'cause we're going to start the bidding in five minutes.
- And we're gonna kick this bad boy off at $50 million.
- Thank you!
- Ooh, nachos.
- He's my asset. I'll handle this.
- Don't get soft on him, Bartowski.
- The only way any of us are safe is if he's under lock and key.
- Well, fine. I can control him.
- Then do it.
- Chuck? What are you doing here?
- I came to protect you, okay?
- To stop you from making a very horrible mistake.
- I know about the glasses.
- I know about the new intersect that you're building.
- Who are you?
- I'm an Agent with the CIA.
- So you were tracking me?
- This friendship is fake?
- Sarah?
- That wasn't real either?
- I'm sorry, okay?
- I really am sorry.
- I'm not trying to hurt your feelings here.
- I just... I can't let you do this.
- These are bad people you're selling to.
- Worse than a guy who pretends to be my only friend?
- Or a woman who pretends to have intercourse with me?
- The truth is, I don't need friends, Chuck.
- Not when I've got these.
- Manoosh!
- Hello, Manoosh.
- We've been looking for you.
- I believe you have something of ours.
- Wow. So now not only does the ring have both Manoosh, but also the new intersect that he's building.
- That is just super.
- Good thing I bought that laser pen from the Japanese booth.
- It burns through anything.
- I thought Sarah specifically said no shopping.
- Just scootch over here, grab it with your mouth.
- Come on. Get your mouth over here and pull it out of my inside pocket. Let's go.
- Come on.
- There we go.
- Oh!
- Shh! Quiet!
- Right here. Okay. On the left.
- Easy. Okay, okay, okay.
- Come on. Shh!
- What do we...
- Don't be shy. Just get in there.
- Yeah, that's it. That's it.
- Okay, ow, ow.
- Easy!
- Don't bite me!
- I'm not biting you.
- All right. You got it?
- Uh-huh. Just be careful of the button.
- It activates the laser.
- Whoa!
- You aim carefully now, Bartowski.
- Don't you make me a eunuch.
- Otherwise, I'll teach you the meaning of "eye for an eye. "
- Get to work.
- Easy.
- I got it!
- Shh. Give me that.
- All right. Here we go.
- Here... lasers.
- Woman : a\*mo can be found in the West pavilion.
- expl\*sives and short-range m\*ssile...
- Look, guys, I'll cut you a deal, huh?
- Half off.
- No, you'll give it to us.
- We don't need you anymore.
- Yeah?
- Looks like you need me now.
- So let's talk about a reasonable fee, okay?
- Drop your g\*n!
- Hey, folks, it sounds like we have another demonstration taking place back here.
- As you can see, many of our products are ideally suited for resolving these types of hostage negotiations.
- Impressive simulation.
- Yeah, well, I'd rather k\*ll him, too, than let you have him, so I guess we're on the same page. Looks like Manoosh dies, then.
- Manoosh is not going to die.
- In my hand, I hold a Japanese laser pen.
- Pinpoint accuracy.
- Could sh\*\*t the wings off a fly, if one was so sadistically inclined, which I am!
- Nobody drop their g\*n!
- He won't do it. I can see it in his eyes. He won't k\*ll me.
- Okay, fine. That's fair. I probably won't k\*ll you.
- But I will remove the greater part of your earlobe.
- What the... ? !
- Casey, what is the de... ? !
- I specifically asked for the same pen that you got.
- She gave me the wrong pen.
- Just like Bartowski, bring a kn\*fe to a g\*n fight.
- Now, where were we?
- Oh, I know. We were going to k\*ll you.
- He's getting away.
- You secure Manoosh. He cannot walk out of here knowing what he knows.
- Wow, Chuck. That was awesome.
- Incredible, just incredible!
- Well, thanks for rescuing me. I mean, if it weren't for you, I'd probably be in some deep, dark cell somewhere.
- Uh...
- Speaking of which, Manoosh, I cannot let you go.
- Chuck, please.
- I won't tell anybody. I promise.
- No one will ever know about the intersect me, the sunglasses, anything.
- I'll disappear. I swear.
- Thanks, Chuck.
- I owe you my life.
- Tour Guide: Here at the tranq g\*n booth, we feature the latest in non-lethal suppression.
- That's 50 ccs of pure-grade ether.
- Your enemies will get plenty of rest before you interrogate them.
- I guess Bartowski doesn't have the stones.
- Another fabulous demonstration.
- I stand corrected.
- He has to go underground.
- If the ring finds him, then he can build them another intersect.
- It's the only way.
- Do you want me to handle it?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I would. Um...
- But I have to do it.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I've been scared to death.
- So, when are you guys going to release me?
- I just want to go home, forget this ever happened.
- You can't go home, Manoosh. We are sending you to a secured isolation facility.
- Somewhere that you will be safe.
- But I didn't do anything wrong!
- I mean, I tried to make a few bucks, but that's not illegal!
- Chuck. You have to help me!
- I thought you were my friend.
- I'm not.
- I'm a spy.
- Chuck.
- Chuck! Please.
- Chuck!
- Hmm. Only one way to deal with burning an asset.
- Johnny Walker.
- Black.
- Hey.
- Where you been, another trip to Paris?
- Uh, Dubai, actually.
- Funny.
- Or-or maybe you were at that yogurt store again?
- I know your ex works there.
- Uh, hey, what about the tutorial?
- Rule number one: Never work on an empty stomach.
- On break. Going to quickie Sushi.
- Hey. There he is.
- Hey.
- Can we talk for a second?
- Uh, yeah, I'm kind of b\*at, Morgan.
- Oh, yeah. I can imagine. All that travel.
- What, uh... what traveling?
- Just driving around town on all those installs.
- Right, yeah.
- It's got to be exhausting.
- Hey, anything you want to talk to me about?
- No. Is there anything you want to ask me?
- No.
- Okay, great. Good talk.
- Absolutely. One of our best.
- Yo.
- How'd it go last night, stallion?
- You take her to pound town?
- Ooh, can I get an address on that?
- Actually, I need a little more research done here, fellas.
- Hmm.
- I told you, we still need to study her sleeping patterns.
- Oh, no. Not-not research on Hannah.
- Research on Chuck.
- ♪ ♪ finally.
- Honey, the tickets that Chuck got us to Paris are here.
- First class!
- I don't think we should go.
- What? They're free tickets.
- No, they're not.
- Nothing is free.
- Those have strings attached.
- What strings? They're from Chuck.
- What are you talking about?
- He...
- You...
- You have to obey me.
- Yeah, I think that was in our vows.
- I am the husband, and I forbid us to go to Paris.
- That's it!
- Oh, hey, Morgan.
- You forbid us? ! Are you kidding me, Devon?
- Ellie, hey. Is everything okay?
- No, I think that there's something weird going on with Chuck and Devon.
- It's like they're... I don't know.
- They're keeping this secret from me.
- Um...
- Okay.
- Are you suggesting Chuck is caught in a big, giant Web of conspiracy and-and deception?
- I know. I know when you put it like that, it sounds ridiculous.
- Because I couldn't agree more!
- All right, I've been thinking about this for months.
- Finally, someone with some common sense.
- Morgan, we have to figure out what's going on.
- Don't worry about it. I got my best men on it.
