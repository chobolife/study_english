# Chuck Versus the Pink Slip

- No one stops us.
- No one ever has.
- [trilling]
- Chuck, did you just flash?
- Oh, Chuck me.
- k*ll him.
- Hyah!
- [man yells]
- Chuck?
- Guys...
- I know kung fu.
- [trilling]
- [man whistles]
- [Eastern European accent]: Agent Carmichael.
- Call me "Charles. "
- [chuckles] You have something that belongs to my boss, Yuri: the case.
- I would like for you to give it to me.
- Please?
- [scoffs]
- You show up with no g*n and "please? "
- What, I quiver in fear?
- Beckman: Chuck, we've got a lock on the case.
- It's there in the room with you.
- Give me the case... or else.
- Or else what?
- Or else I do this?
- No, I was thinking something more like this.
- Ha! Cool, cool, cool! Everybody be cool!
- Everybody just chill out!
- Very, very good. On the ground now.
- Nice and easy.
- Now, Yuri, hand me that case, and then after that, it's pirogi time.
- Ooh.
- Beckman: sh**t him, Chuck.
- Do it.
- sh**t me.
- Don't mess with me, Yuri.
- Beckman: sh**t him now!
- Get him!
- Beckman: Chuck, what is happening? Your heart rate just spiked.
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. I got punched in the face.
- It's throbbing a little bit.
- Get out of there now!
- Where's my exit?
- They're closing in on you.
- Get to a roof.
- Chopper's...
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
- Listen, General, I don't want to sound demanding here, but I could really use that chopper right about now!
- The chopper's too far out.
- Satellite says there's a power line on the roof that runs to the next building.
- Zip line across, we'll find you a new exit...
- What do you mean, zip line?
- It's in the Intersect.
- Okay, I got this.
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- General, I don't think this is a good idea. I'm not flashing.
- Do it, Chuck!
- Flash!
- Look, if you stress me out, it's never going to work.
- Chuck, flash!
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Flash.
- One, two, three, flash.
- I don't think my vertigo is helping here.
- General, are you there?
- General? !
- Yuri: You're dead.
- That's all, Frank.
- Terminate the simulation.
- [with Southern accent]: Copy that, ma'am.
- Chuck?
- You can come down now.
- [sighs]
- Beckman: Why didn't you sh**t Yuri, Chuck?
- Well, we were very close, and while I realize it's just a simulation, safety first, you know?
- And to be perfectly honest, I'm still not comfortable with the whole sh**ting people thing.
- This isn't working out.
- Look, General, I realize that we've had our setbacks, I... I... I do, but let's not dwell in the past here.
- I'm convinced I can be a great spy. I know it.
- We've spent millions of dollars to get you up and running as our new Intersect agent.
- It's not working.
- Well, maybe my dad can help.
- He built the computer.
- The problem is not with the computer.
- It's with you.
- The Intersect 2. 0 was designed to go into a real spy, like Bryce Larkin, someone in complete control of their feelings.
- [car door opening] What are you saying?
- It's over.
- Our Los Angeles field unit will keep an eye on you until a final decision can be made regarding your status.
- Wait, hold on just... just a second here.
- Are you saying you're firing me, General?
- Do you... you have any idea what I gave up for this?
- Good-bye, Chuck.
- No.
- You don't know what I said no to!
- Frank. Oh.
- Casey: Go home, tell your sister you went on a last-minute trip to Europe, six weeks.
- Chuck: Okay. Where are we really going?
- Casey: To a Red Site training facility.
- Training for what?
- For you, moron.
- The new Intersect.
- They're gonna train you to use it, turn you into a real super-spy.
- Chuck: Sarah, did Casey tell you they're moving me to a training facility?
- I'm going to be a real spy.
- I know, I heard.
- Come on. What... ?
- What's the matter?
- If you do this, if you go, you're gonna be a spy for the rest of your life.
- Every city is gonna be a new mission and a new identity, and you're not gonna be the same person.
- Yeah. That's a great thing.
- Chuck, listen. We could...
- We could what?
- We could run?
- Together. You and me.
- We go now, and we never look back.
- Are you serious?
- I have some money saved up.
- I'd have to get us some new identities, create an escape route.
- For now, go to the training facility in Prague, then meet me at the Nadrazi train station in three weeks' time at 7:00, and then I can figure the rest out later.
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying I want to be a real person again.
- With you.
- This is what you want, right?
- I mean, this is it, Chuck.
- Will you run away with me?
- Yeah.
- Ellie: Chuck? Chuck, what happened?
- Chuck, honey, where's Sarah?
- I lost her.
- The girl of my dreams.
- It was all my fault.
- Well, maybe not.
- Why don't you just pick up the phone and call her?
- You guys can work it out.
