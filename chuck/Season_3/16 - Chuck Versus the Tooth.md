# Chuck Versus the Tooth

- Camp security coordinator.
- Devon? Oh, baby, you're burning up.
- Justin!
- They just left.
- I took care of the husband and made it look like malaria.
- She doesn't suspect a thing.
- Guys, we got to get this place fixed up before Devon and Ellie get back.
- Well, actually, I was going to start with our place.
- That is, if your offer for me to move in still stands.
- Yeah.
- It's official.
- There is absolutely nothing on TV.
- Yeah. Monday nights can be a bit of a wasteland.
- President Jakaya Kuti of Zamibia arrived in Los Angeles today.
- On his agenda are diplomatic meetings and a performance of Beethoven tomorrow night by The LA City Symphony.
- Ugh, sounds like Beckman.
- Hey. Jackpot!
- Oh, no, no, no. You've made me watch this before.
- This is ridiculous.
- Sarah, please. You could learn a lot from spies like these.
- Are you kidding me?
- Look at these people.
- They're breaking about 17 different rules of protocol!
- Sweetheart, I'm not actually implying that you could learn anything about being a spy from Chevy Chase or Dan Aykroyd.
- I was just simply making a joke.
- You remember? Jokes?
- I love you.
- Sorry. I must have fallen asleep.
- Chuck.
- I love you.
- Oh, Sarah, it feels so good to finally hear you say that.
- Sarah, look outside, quick.
- Finally.
- I'm so hungry.
- Isn't it great we found a place that delivers Zamibian food?
- Zamibian food?
- Hello, Chuck.
- Shaw?
- Oh, what?
- Did you have another bad dream?
- It was, it was about Beethoven... and Zamibia...
- Chuck, I'm worried about you.
- Every time you fall asleep, you have a horrible nightmare.
- But this one was trying to tell me something.
- Tell you what?
- General, the Ring is going to try and k*ll the president of Zamibia at the Beethoven concert tomorrow night!
- Tomorrow night?
- We could have done this in the morning?
- You know how dear my sleep is to me, Bartowski.
- Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Casey and General. I-I know that it's very late, and you are obviously very... busy. Um...
- But the president of Zamibia is in danger.
- Did you flash on something, Chuck?
- I...
- Mm...
- I know it because of my dream.
- Your... Your dream?
- I've been having these very, very vivid dreams, okay?
- First, I saw the news report on Kuti, the president of Zamibia, but then in my dream, I saw Beethoven.
- And then Shaw was there, and he was delivering Zamibian food.
- And then he tried to k*ll everyone!
- So, obviously, the Zamibian president is going to be assassinated by the Ring at the Beethoven concert.
- General, permission to slap Bartowski?
- He had a bad dream.
- General, Chuck has been under a lot of stress lately with these dreams, and-
- No, Walker.
- I think I understand the situation.
- And, to be honest, it makes perfect sense.
- Thank you. Thank you, General.
- Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
- What are we going to do, huh? What's our assignment?
- Chuck, I'm assigning you to see a CIA therapist.
- These dreams you're having are getting in the way of your work, and our sleep.
- No, no, no, no. This is crazy. A therapist?
- I don't need a therapist, okay?
- Therapists are for people who have real problems.
- I'm fine.
- Are you comfortable, Chuck?
- No, no, not particularly. No.
- How does this work, exactly?
- I've only seen what you see in movies and stuff like that.
- Do you ask me questions?
- And I just answer? Or is it like a word association thing?
- So, you would, like, say "father" and-
- Actually, no, no, no. Give me another word.
- Do you want to talk about your father, Chuck?
- This wasn't my idea, you know.
- So, no, I don't really want to talk about anything, to be perfectly honest.
- Despite your sparkling conversation k*ll.
- That was, that was a joke.
- I was just...
- Just going to town on that pad, aren't you?
- Just a little joke. Okay, fine. I'll talk.
- Where do I start? Uh...
- Okay, well, my girlfriend just moved in with me.
- Best part of my life.
- Really rock-solid relationship.
- Not a problem there.
- You know, she's a little distant.
- She could be more communicative, though.
- But she doesn't exactly say, "I love you" back.
- I've never really done this before, you know?
- Even though I know that she loves me, I'm just, you know, just kind of noting it.
- Because I know. I know that she loves me.
- And I know that.
- Do you?
- Let's get back to your dreams.
- It's my belief that they are a product of your subconscious interacting with the Intersect.
- Wait, what?
- How...
- You know about the Intersect?
- I'm a CIA psychiatrist.
- I know everything about you, Chuck.
- And as far as the Intersect goes, we've known for some time that it could spur a host of side effects.
- Like dry scalp?
- Because I have had annoyingly dry scalp since...
- The Intersect is extraordinarily powerful.
- It has the potential to... overwhelm your mind.
- With an end result akin to something much like... insanity.
- Insanity?
- Doc, I'm not insane.
- And you're not sure about that.
- So, it could just be that the Intersect is doing its thing while I'm sleeping.
- And if that's true, then President Kuti is in danger.
- Slow down, Chuck.
- Something is going to happen at the concert tonight, okay?
- And if I'm there, we-we could stop it And then I'm not crazy, right?
- I'm sorry, Chuck, but I can't let you do that.
- Until further notice, I'm removing you from field duty.
- There he is.
- Welcome home, pal.
- It's good to be home.
- Hey, look at you. All right. You know what?
- I'd say malaria aside, you look pretty... awesome.
- I actually feel pretty great.
- I'm ready to get back out there.
- I had an important realization.
- That looks don't get you everywhere?
- No, Morgan.
- You can die just as easily from a mosquito in Africa as you can from a spy in Burbank.
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Listen. Fear is the mind k*ll.
- Yeah.
- Right.
- You can't live scared, bro.
- Not for yourself, not for anyone.
- I think it's jammed a little bit, or something.
- This one's broken.
- Oh. Hey. Ah, Ellie.
- I heard Devon has malaria.
- Yeah.
- Nasty stuff.
- Had it four, maybe five times myself.
- Tough to say.
- Uh, you know, those meds aren't going to help him.
- What he needs are African snake herbs.
- I might have some back at my place.
- I will keep that in mind, John.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
- Crazy.
- You're not crazy.
- Don't freak out.
- Chuck, you in there?
- Come in.
- Hey. Hey.
- How was the doctor's?
- Uh, good. Great, actually.
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. What about you?
- You hear anything from Beckman about anything?
- Chuck, I know I'm your partner, but I'm also your girlfriend.
- And you can tell me anything.
- I know that.
- Of course I- Of course I know that.
- Honestly. Hey, I'm fine, okay?
- Just a solid good night's rest, and I'm right as rain.
- Which I don't totally understand 'cause rain is kind of all over the place.
- Glad you're okay. Thanks.
- Nothing like absorbing a little local culture.
- President Jakaya Kuti of Zamibia will be in town today.
- The tiny African nation seeks to improve its rocky diplomatic relations... Okay, Chuck.
- You're watching more cable television than is healthy for a young man.
- Please talk to me. What's going on?
- Buddy, I've been having the strangest and most vivid dreams that I've ever had in my life.
- How vivid are we talking about here?
- Well, they have to do with that guy.
- I guess he's kind of handsome in an an authoritative kind of way.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Well, me, neither.
- But he's the president of Zamibia, and he's going to be at the symphony tonight.
- And the dream that I had made me think that...
- Made me know that he's in danger, man.
- But Beckman sent me to some doctor who thinks that it's just the Intersect playing with my subconscious, but I know that I'm right, and nobody believes me.
- Sarah doesn't believe you?
- S- I'm trying not to involve Sarah in this, okay?
- Things are very good between us right now, and the last thing I want is for her to think that I'm Crazy.
- Yeah.
- Well, here's the thing.
- If this guy really is in danger, right?
- Then don't you think it would be crazy not to help the president of Zanfiria-bi-ha?
- Zam, uh... Zamibia.
- Yeah. Anyway, I'm gonna help you.
- Thanks, buddy, thank you. Yeah, of course.
- What's your pant size, Chuck?
- I'm just gonna say it: I need a woman.
- It's been far too long, Jeffrey.
- A man has needs.
- So what's the plan?
- I will be hitting on all the applicable women in electronics, DVDs, and all around the entrances and the emergency exits.
- You're leaving me Home Appliances?
- It's full of lumpy housewives.
- My favorite.
- You're welcome.
- OMG, Jefferson, is it a mirage?

- No, my eyes do not deceive me.

- Two, three grams?
- Hawai'iis treating your body very well.
- Thanks. Is Morgan around?
- Who? Who?

- Two tuxedos from the mall.

- Done. All right, let's go.
- Well, I hate to be the one to tell you this-
- I don't really- but Morgan is in, a, um... a very bad place.
- Oh, my God, is he okay?
- No. He's focused, responsible, driven.

- Whoa, Anna, what are you doing here?
- In L.A. for a few days.

- Duty calls.
- You mean, Call of Duty?
- Come on, Morgan, your game can wait.
- Why are you in a tux?
- Uh, tux, right.
- I'm going to the symphony with Chuck.
- The symphony? With Chuck?
- My God, can you guys get any weirder?
- At this point, no, probably not.
- Listen, I'd love to catch up and talk and everything.
- Why don't you call me tomorrow morning, all right?
- And, uh, you look good.
- Wow!
- Excuse me.
- Hey, buddy, buddy, that's Kuti up in the president's box there.
- Our mission: to make sure nothing happens to him.
- Now remember, Morgan, my code name is Charles Carmichael.
- Yeah, yeah, I got it. I got it.
- Mine's Cobra.
- Okay, let's do this.
- Great. I'm on a mission with Cobra.
- Maybe I am going crazy.
- Are you sure you want the box set of ER?
- Hey, but all 15 seasons?
- Yeah, I know, Devon, it's the best show ever.
- Okay, fine.
- I'll see you later. Bye.
- Ellie?
- Justin? !
- Oh, I'm sorry. This is, this is bizarre.
- Why aren't you in Africa?
- Did you, did you... did you get malaria, too? What?
- No, I'm actually here to see you.
- Can we go somewhere and talk for a bit?
- Let me ask you a question.
- This whole Anna thing, you know?
- I mean, you think she wants me back?
- Better question, actually: Do I take her back?
- Didn't she break your heart, buddy?
- I mean, you did hit rock bottom.
- Well, bottom, yeah, but rock bottom?
- Shh!
- Look, later, all right, buddy?
- Remember, we're on a mission.
- Eyes on the president.
- Shh!
- Sorry.
- She's, she's kind of like the love of my life, you know?
- And when you want to talk about Sarah- which is constantly- we talk about Sarah.
- So I just thought maybe you could help me out.
- Hey-hey-hey, that is not fair!
- Shh!
- You work for the CIA?
- I know it's a lot to process, but meeting you in Africa wasn't an accident.
- I wanted to talk to you then, but your husband got sick before we could fully brief you.
- This is about your father, Ellie.
- My father? My father?
- Are you kidding me?
- My father is...
- He's eccentric, sure, But the work Stephen J. Bartowski did in the field of molecular computing has turned out to be... brilliant.
- Which is why as we speak, there are some very bad people looking for him, including a man named John Casey.
- He's an NSA double agent.
- He's been monitoring you for another organization.
- John Casey works with my brother.
- You don't have to take my word for it.
- Just... keep an eye on him.
- I caution you about telling anyone about this.
- But what about my brother and my husband?
- Here's the problem: They're gonna tell you you're crazy; as crazy as you think I am right now.
- We came to you because we need you, Ellie.
- Your father needs you.
- What are you doing here?
- Thought you had a fancy date with Chuck.
- Saw him leave the store a little while ago in his tux.
- Chuck's in a tux?
- Pull up surveillance in the store entrance and the parking lot from 60 minutes ago.
- There, there!
- Roll it back.
- Freeze!
- The concert with the Zamibian President.
- Chuck's gonna try and prove us wrong about Kuti.
- I'm gonna k*ll them both.
- Hey, hey.
- Chuck.
- Why are you onstage?
- What?
- Buddy, I'm not onstage.
- You sh*t me, Chuck.
- What are you doing here?
- What are you trying to tell me?
- The dream isn't about me, Chuck.
- It's about a scientist: Dr. Kowambe.
- Kowambe.
- Oh, my God, that's him!
- That's the guy who's going to k*ll Kuti!
- What? Are you serious? How do you know?
- I just had another dream, buddy.
- I got to get up to the president's box! Shh!
- Okay, listen, ma'am, put a sock in it.
- You, Morgan, stay in the seat.
- No. What if the seat is dangerous? I could be attacked.
- You're not gonna get attacked.
- There could be a sn*per! Shh! Fine, fine. Here.
- Take my backup tranq g*n.
- For life-or-death situations only.
- There!
- You take Bartowski.
- I got the little elf.
- No, Chuck, stop.
- I can't let you do this.
- Sarah, listen, I had another dream.
- The guy who's gonna k*ll Kuti is in the president's box right now!
- You should have told me, and I could have helped you.
- I'm sorry, I am.
- I- I didn't want to get you mixed up in all this dream stuff until I had proof, all right?
- I love you, and right now I need you to believe that I'm not crazy.
- Okay, well, let's get into that box.
- Stand up and walk out of here quietly, or I'll k*ll you and drag you out of here.
- Your choice.
- What are you reaching for, Morgan?
- I've been authorized to use this tranq g*n.
- Now I don't want to, okay, 'cause I consider us friends now, but I will use this...
- Okay, here we go.
- Good evening. Routine CIA w*apon sweep.
- What is the meaning of this? !
- Listen, listen, the guy right there.
- Dr. Kowambe? Yeah, Dr. Kowambe.
- Mr. President, who is this person?
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Okay, Chuck, just take it easy, please.
- I'm taking it easy.
- I'm taking it very, very easy.
- Stop!
- This man is Africa's most respected scientist!
- Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
- This is preposterous!
- You could have at least have had the pretty one frisk me.
- Chuck, are you out of your mind? !
- What are you doing? ! I was wrong! It's not an assassination attempt!
- He had Ring intel in his mouth!
- The tooth! The tooth! Find the tooth! What? !
- This man is clearly insane! Have this man arrested!
- There's hidden data in the tooth!
- Wait a minute! I can explain everything!
- Guys, guys, help me!
- I'm not crazy!
- Sarah!
- Explain how it's possible that last night Chuck, aided by the world class spy that is Morgan Grimes, managed to elude you and cause an international incident that the president of the United States himself had to apologize for.
- In Zamibian.
- Tricky language.
- Lots of clicks and vowels.
- General, how is Chuck doing?
- At the moment, Dr. Dreyfus believes Chuck's condition is... worse than originally diagnosed.
- Originally diagnosed? I- I don't understand.
- I'm sorry, but the doctor believes the Intersect is overwhelming Chuck's brain.
- His mental deterioration may be... unavoidable.
- He told me he was fine.
- Know that we will do everything possible for him.
- I care about him, too.
- We'll go this afternoon.
- Nothing will make him feel better than seeing you.
- Oh, my God. I can't believe this is happening.
- It's happening, Chuck.
- Disturbing as it may be, you're currently a patient in a psychiatric institution.
- Best to come to terms with that sooner than later.
- Wow. You really know how to make a guy feel better about his situation, Doc.
- You should meet some of the other people here with serious psychiatric issues.
- This is Lewis.
- Although he currently prefers the name Merlin.
- Ooh, is that right?
- Merlin, like the... th-the... like the wizard?
- What you in for?
- Is it something, uh... sexual?
- No! No, it's not!
- Not sexual at all.
- I've been having these very troubling dreams.
- Sexual?
- Non-sexual troubling dreams.
- Has my team contacted you yet?
- Ugh, don't hold your breath.
- I've been waiting for my team since '93.
- That's enough, Lewis.
- What? His-his team? What team?
- Who is this guy? He's nuts.
- His spy team.
- This is a CIA facility.
- Everyone here used to be a spy.
- As I don't have to tell you, it's a stressful job.
- People tend to... crack.
- Everyone here?
- Spies?
- Like me?
- John?
- Anybody home?
- Hi, Ellie.
- What's up?
- Hi, John. Um...
- I just remembered that you had mentioned something about herbs for Devon's malaria.
- Right. I'll check.
- Okay.
- Here you go.
- Make sure he takes them with some nice, warm goat milk.
- Okay. Thank you.
- Ah.
- Whoa, El.
- Everything okay?
- Okay.
- I need you to listen to me very closely, and I need you to promise me that you're not going to freak out.
- Okay.
- I have reason to believe that our neighbor, John Casey, is a very, very, bad man.
- And we need to get far away from him.
- Babe, you got to get that story about him getting drunk and peeing himself out of your mind.
- He was in a bad place. It happens.
- No, Devon. I was just in his apartment, and he has g*n.
- Very big g*n.
- We have to do something.
- Okay.
- Okay. Casey has some serious g*n.
- Is that creepy? Yes.
- Is that illegal?
- Sadly, no.
- You don't believe me?
- You don't believe me.
- It's just- it sounds a little crazy, is all.
- You think that I sound crazy?
- Come on, El.
- How about I make you a cup of tea?
- Chamomile, maybe?
- Hmm? Less caffeine, but still so delicious.
- Yes. Okay. I-I'm sure that I do. I do sound crazy.
- Tea's great. Thank you.
- How you doing there, pal?
- Hmm?
- Is there anything we can do for you?
- Yeah, as a matter of fact.
- I need you to get some evidence analyzed.
- That scientist? He's still out there, and he's working for the Ring. I'm sure of it.
- Please, Chuck, the way you're talking...
- Come on. It's me.
- I need to show you something.
- Sarah, give me your hand.
- Give your boyfriend your hand.
- Is that...
- Yeah. The tooth.
- Is it yours?
- What? No. That's crazy.
- It's Dr. Kowambe's tooth.
- And it's not real. It's fake.
- It contains Ring intel.
- Secrets, plans, something.
- In the tooth?
- Yeah. Try to keep up, Casey. Okay?
- You need to get that analyzed ASAP.
- The tooth is the key.
- The truth is in the tooth.
- Oh. Well, uh...
- We'll check that out, and you get some rest there, pal.
- We'll come back and visit you tomorrow.
- Chuck.
- Sarah, you can't give up on me, okay?
- I won't.
- I'll get it tested.
- Time to go, Chuck.
- Look, Walker, I hope he's right, too, but don't be disappointed if Bartowski's... Stop it!
- He's going to be right.
- Nothing abnormal.
- Just a tooth.
- Chuck was wrong.
- Hmm. I'm sorry.
- ♪ ♪
- Excuse me. Does this come in g*n?
- Yes, sir. I-I believe that does come in g*n.
- I'll check in the back for you.
- Hey.
- What's going on? Where is Chuck?
- Not now. Not now.
- Listen. Please, please, please.
- You got to tell me something, all right? Just let me know he's okay. Casey, please.
- They got him in a lockdown, psychiatric facility.
- Seems the Intersect's giving him a bit of a hard time.
- What? No. man, no.
- That's crazy.
- Morgan.
- There you are.
- Sorry to bother you again, but do you have a second?
- I get that you're assistant manager now and all, but-
- Oh, hey, I'd love to. I'd love to. I just...
- Now is not really a good time.
- So...
- You look good.
- Dissed twice by Morgan Grimes?
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Right there. Diagonally.
- You have a call.
- Huh? Oh, thanks. Hello?
- Chuck?
- You can... Hey. Hey, hey, Sarah?
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey, so, uh...
- What did you find out?
- Chuck, we ran every test possible, and... I'm sorry.
- It's just a tooth.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, but even though you were wrong about the tooth, it doesn't mean anything.
- The important thing is to stay positive.
- Everything's going to be okay.
- I know.
- Thanks for trying.
- May I help you?
- I hope so. I'm here to see a Charles Bartowski.
- Well, there's no record of Dr. Dreyfus authorizing any after hours visits.
- So, if you don't mind, I don't want to have you escorted from the building.
- Of course.
- That will not be necessary.
- Find me Bartowski.
- Good evening.
- Let me guess. You're here because of Chuck.
- Doctor, I know that there has to be something more to his condition.
- He can't just be deteriorating in this way.
- Why?
- Because you care about him?
- No. You don't understand.
- He's not like other people.
- He is...
- Incredibly special.
- Huh. Especially to you, I gather.
- He needs to be okay.
- I- I need him to be okay.
- I'd like to go to the hospital tonight and talk to him, try and figure this out, and then help him somehow, you know?
- Please.
- I love him.
- Ever tell him that?
- Please, Doctor, I'm begging you.
- You're not the only one.
- Well, I'm really glad the doctor wants to see me,  because I sure want to see the doctor.
- Hey. Whoa. There's no need to be rough or physical.
- Jeez.
- Mr. Bartowski.
- Ooh.
- Not the doctor I was expecting to see.
- Why did you take my tooth?
- More to the point, why did you take the wrong tooth?
- What?
- Wha- the... the wrong tooth?
- The data is in a tooth.
- I believe this is the fake one you are looking for.
- I was, I was right.
- I was right.
- Well, I was, I-I was wrong, I was wrong.
- Clearly I was wrong, but I was right!
- This is great news! This is great news!
- That means I'm not crazy!
- Yes.
- It also means, as soon as you tell me where you got your information- and rest assured, you will tell me- you are going to die.
- No, that's not great news at all.
- That's a giant needle- bad, bad.
- Colored liquid even worse.
- Yes, it's one of my favorites.
- Tetraclydine- a designer psychotropic cocktail.
- Gah!
- In around ten minutes, you're going to be extremely forthcoming.
- Dr. Dreyfus!
- Thank God!
- Guys. Guys!
- Guys, guys, help me, help me!
- I need you!
- Awesome. Take him back to the room.
- Wah!
- Restrain him.
- I don't f-
- I don't feel so good.
- Let him go!
- Or suffer the wrath of Merlin and his army!
- Spies, attack!
- Damn.
- It was a good idea, Merlin. It's over.
- No one believes you.
- No one's coming for you.
- Chuck.
- Well, well.
- Looks like it's good we came.
- You came back for me.
- I'll always come back for you.
- So will Merlin, Chuck.
- It seems you're owed an apology, Agent Bartowski.
- You were right about Kowambe.
- He was illegally harvesting human organs, experimenting with genetic manipulation and reengineering.
- He was scheduled to meet a Ring operative to sell this research.
- Well, that's fantastic.
- I mean, not-not the organ harvesting stuff, obviously.
- That's... that's very, very sad.
- So, does this mean I have a clean bill of health?
- It would seem that way, Chuck, but I can't actually clear you.
- Well, then who can?
- So... what did we land on here?
- That, uh, my dreams have the potential to work in concert with my flashes?
- Is that where you think we landed, Chuck?
- Oh, come on, Doc.
- Level with me.
- Am I cleared for duty or not?
- You were right, Chuck.
- Your dreams were caused by the Intersect.
- I'm clearing you for duty.
- All right.
- But...
- But? But what? Why is there a but?
- But your dreams are also proof of stress the Intersect puts on your brain.
- And it is my belief that that stress would continue and intensify, likely leading to serious mental deterioration.
- Um...
- What does that mean exactly?
- Am I okay?
- This is a new science.

- But if I may, Chuck, I think it's something you should discuss with your partner, Agent Walker.
- Thanks, Doc.
- Morgan Guillermo Grimes, I refuse to be denied an audience with the Burbank Buy More's assistant manager.
- If you run off on me one more time, I swear I'll call corporate.
- She could want you back, man.
- That box could be an improvised expl*sive device.
- Be extremely cool around that thing.
- Hey, listen, I feel like I owe you an explanation.
- I'm so sorry. Last few days have been insane.
- Morgan, all I've been trying to do is get a second of your time to give you this.
- Some stuff you left behind in Hawaii.
- Thought you may want it back.
- Huh.
- I think I'm okay without it.
- Well... here's something else you may have forgotten.
- I got to hand it to you, Morgan.
- You really know how to play a girl.
- Well, you know, some men have it and-
- What are you talking about? I don't... You know what they say about not knowing you want something until you can't have it?
- Well, it's true.
- You've changed, Morgan.
- I want you back.
- Wow.
- Really?
- If it took me running from you to realize that I'm somebody you want, then I don't really think that you're the person that I want.
- So, yeah, you're right.
- I have changed.
- I'll see you later.
- I don't mind leftovers.
- Hey, Sarah, hey. We need to talk.
- Sure, Chuck, but...
- No, look, this is very important.
- I love you.
- It shouldn't have taken me this long to say it, but I've never felt this way.
- Before you, the only future that I could think about was my next mission.
- And now all I can think about is a future with you.
- I love you, Chuck.
- I love you, too.
- So what did you want to tell me?
- Is it about the doctor?
- What did he say?
- He said that... I'm fine.
- So...
- Justin? Hey.
- It's okay.
- It's just me.
- So what can I do?
- Do you know how to contact your father?
- If we can talk to him, let him know what's happening, we may be able to protect him.
- He moves around a lot.
- He's... really paranoid.
- He doesn't trust anyone.
- Last time he left though, he made sure that I had a way to contact him.
- Thank you, Ellie.
- And just remember, you're serving your country.
- Shaw.
- You're not bleeding anymore.
- That's right, Chuck, I'm not.
- What does that mean?
- It means I'm still alive.
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Nothing.
- Nothing. Sorry.
- Go back to sleep.
