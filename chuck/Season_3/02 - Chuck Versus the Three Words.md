# Chuck Versus the Three Words

- We have to go, Chuck. This is it.
- Are you coming? I can't.
- Sarah, they wanted me to be a spy.
- Really important people told me that they thought I could change the world.
- I acted impulsively, and it won't happen again.
- You're a spy now, Chuck.
- You have to keep your feelings to yourself.
- (panting)
- (g\*n)

- God, it feels like I haven't been off duty in years.
- How long you in town for anyway?
- I plan on getting out quick.
- Los Angeles has all the cultural panache of a Porta Potti.
- I've missed you.
- So, why are you still here?
- How long can you possibly have to protect some doofus at a stereo store?
- You know, I don't really want to talk about work.
- Ah, so you're sleeping with him.
- We have a very professional relationship.
- Oh.
- What?
- Nothing.
- You're just really into him, that's all.
- Can we please not talk about Chuck?
- Oh, my God, Walker.
- What?
- You broke the cardinal rule of spying, didn't you?
- You're breaking the cardinal rule of getting dumped.
- Can we please talk about something other than Sarah?
- Yeah. Good, except you're moping, man.
- I am not moping.
- Hey, hey, what the hell are we doing here?
- Could you at least pause the game?
- I know you're upset about Sarah, but there is no pause button on life.
- See what I'm trying to say?
- We are two very, very sexy bachelors with the world at our fingertips.
- Our lives are incredible.
- Yeah, incredibly average to sub-par.
- Look, all I'm saying is, there's gotta be, what, two million ladies in the City of Angels?

- Look, dude, no one's asking you to fall in love.
- Okay, we're just here to have you, you know, forget about Sarah for a little while.
- That's all.
- Oh, my God, it's Sarah!
- Chuck: What? !
- Wh-What do you mean, Sarah? My Sarah?
- Technically, she's single if you think about it, you know, so, yes, your Sarah.
- And she's with Carina.
- You think she'd remember me?
- We did only go on that one date, and very tall women have very short memories.
- You know what, okay, I'm gonna go and do a little spy work, buddy.
- Yeah, yeah. So, you go and get some drinks, and I'll kind of suss out the situation with Carina.
- Hey!
- Hi, hi, Carina, long time.
- Wow, what a nice surprise.
- And Sarah, good to see you tonight.
- Sorry.
- Chuck, what are you doing here?
- Are you spying on me?
- I don't, uh, no.

- Just some girl.
- Carina's not just some girl, okay?
- She's basically a Swedish super-model.
- The country's greatest export since Bjorn Borg.
- Well, people mistake me for him all the time.

- We've learned ten million dollars was recently wired into Stromberg's account.
- We don't know what this w\*apon is, but someone's willing to pay a lot of money for it.
- Well, we gotta get it before it falls into enemy hands.
- Thanks for being on the case, Nancy Drew.
- My engagement party is today at Karl's house.
- Sarah and Chuck will enter as my best friend and her loving boyfriend, the cover that they established at the club.
- Mr. Bartowski, that a problem?
- I'm cool.
- No problemo. And Casey will pose as my father.
- Check your math, sister, I'll play your brother.
- That's a bit of a stretch, Colonel.
- Yeah, Casey, uh, I think you have dungarees that are older than Carina.
- Colonel, you will assume the identity of Agent Miller's uncle.
- Carina's father's much younger brother.
- Karl's storing the w\*apon in a gold case inside a vault room adjacent to his bedroom.
- During Karl's toast, Sarah and Chuck will slip out, break in and apprehend it.
- He keeps the access key to the secured area in his pants, which I can easily access.
- Oh, I'll bet you can.
- Karl also just installed a state-of-the-art security system in the vault room.
- So, I pe the two of you can handle anything you find there.
- Uh, (clears throat) "any" is kind of a broad word.
- Chuck is just being modest.
- His recent training has equipped him to handle any security obstacle.
- There won't be a problem.
- Better not be.
- This whole mission rides on you, Chuck.
- What a surprise.
- Carina is almost six feet of pure Swede.
- That's just over 182 centimeters of Lapland, know what I mean?
- Stop it, Grimes, this is pathetic.
- As if a hot piece of tuchus like that would get anywhere near dirty treife like you.
- I could totally nail that if I wanted it.
- If you're such a stallion, prove it.
- Ask her out.
- Now, listen, I know she's kind of seeing someone, and...
- Mm, I didn't see a ring on her perfect finger.
- Well, I'm slow-playing it.
- You snooze, you lose boobs.
- We checked out Chuck's calendar software, and we noticed that Ellie and her pin-up husband are away at some doctor thing for a few days.
- So, it's the perfect time for us to throw you a housewarming party. Nah, I don't know...
- I'll even prepare my special punch.
- You'll have home field advantage.

- You know, kind of like we did before.
- Carina: What is he doing?
- Well, what do you think?
- It's just a cover, Chuck.
- What the hell are youdoing to m?
- You and Sarah are supposed to be a happy couple.
- Look, ever since I got back from Prague, Sarah's been so cold.
- You idiot.
- The reason Sarah's cold is because she loves you.
- Now, get your head out of your ass and go be a spy.
- Sarah, hey.
