# Chuck Versus the Fake Name

- Hi, I'm Chuck, here's a few things you might need to know. Who is that?
- Super-hot blonde, heart of ice, yeah, it's Chuck's ex, Sarah.
- What's their deal?
- Turns out I haven't been completely honest.
- The truth is, I was hitting on you.
- It was completely unprofessional, and I apologize.
- Oh, my God.
- Chuck has a secret girlfriend.
- I can't believe that Chuck is sneaking around my back like this, living this other life that he doesn't think I know anything about.
- I guess he'll tell you about Hannah when he's ready, hon.
- Hannah- you've said it a hundred times before so casual.
- Hannah. Chuck had asked me to keep it a secret.
- You know, maybe it's me.
- Maybe he thinks, like, I'll judge him or something.
- I mean, he told me about the first girl he had a crush on-
- Mrs. Seaver.
- Who?
- The mom from Growing Pains.
- And-and you, you used to tell me everything, too, and now you and my brother are as thick as thieves.
- Is there something you're keeping from me, too?
- Any secrets? No, nothing, not a thing.
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.
- Your pulse is racing.
- I'm exercising.
- Honey, go to Chuck.
- Tell him how feel. Be honest.
- That's good advice, honey.
- I love you.
- Chuck?
- Chuck?
- Chuck, listen, uh, I get it.
- You know, I'm not the one that you... share everything with anymore.
- I just- I just miss being that person.
- Everybody knew about this new girl that you're dating before I did.
- I just wanted to let you know that I'm a really good secret keeper.
- And if you don't want Sarah to know about the new girl...
- I won't tell Sarah if you don't.
- Um, I'm Hannah.
- Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing. No.
- Ellie... uh... my sister.
- I've been meaning to introduce you to... Hannah. Hannah- who apparently you've already just met right now. Mm-hmm.
- Hannah is... a girl.
- She's a girl... and a friend.
- A very close friend.
- Technically as close as two people can kind of... Okay.
- Doughnut? No, thanks.
- Um, I need to go and get dressed so I can go to work.
- It was, uh... it was really great to meet you, Ellie.
- Likewise.
- Okay. Bye. Bye.
- I am- I am so sorry.
- I just... I don't know, I felt like I was out of the loop, and you used to tell me everything, and...
- I know. I'm sorry. You shouldn't be sorry, I'm sorry.
- I wanted to tell you.
- I've just been really wrapped up at work, and...
- But I have an idea.
- I'm going to make dinner for the four of us tonight.
- And guess what, it's going to be your favorite.
- Oh, yeah.
- My famous chicken pepperoni.
- Huh? Oh, I got to tell you the truth.
- I love... , your chicken pepperoni.
- Yes, I know this.
- Really, I'm just-
- I'm so glad that you're moving on from Sarah.
- I thought you didn't want dessert.
- I don't.
- I want yours.
- See, my dessert is contained within your dessert.
- Listen, Shaw...
- I like that.
- Keep it a last-name basis. Impersonal.
- Very sexy, Walker.
- I don't think we should see each other in a non-work capacity.
- Oh, is that what this is?
- Look, I-it's just, it's becoming a pattern for me to get involved with the guys that I work with, and I really need to put a stop to that before it starts.
- So, this is a preemptive breakup?
- I need to stop mixing my personal life with my professional life.
- I'd be a liar if I didn't say I was disappointed, but I get it.
- The vehicle in question has arrived.
- Roger that.
- The man is on the move.
- I have the target in sight.
- Did you wear cologne in my car?
- Nobody wants to smell you.
- The next time you wear cologne in my car, I will end you.
- Night-night.
- Rafe Gruber is a martial arts expert, a sharpsh\*\*ter.
- He is one of five people who can hit a target from half a mile away.
- I mean, the man is a chameleon.
- It is a miracle we even got a hit on his location.
- Very few people have seen his face.
- Big deal, not impressed.
- Well, The Ring is.
- They wired a million dollars into his account.
- Enemy of my enemy is my friend, kind of thing.
- We need to know who The Ring wants dead.
- There's nothing this clown can do that I can't do.
- I'm perfect for this mission.
- Still, we're going with Bartowski on this one.
- He'll assume Rafe's identity in order to learn the Ring's target.
- The Intersect is performing. He can do this. He's ready.
- Right, Walker?
- Chuck wants to be a spy.
- Hello, team Bartowski.
- Tempt anyone with a tasty treat, huh?
- What's with him?
- Stallion had a date last night; must have gotten lucky.
- So, what is going on?
- Who's this guy?
- That is Rafe Gruber.
- Wow, old Rafie boy's not such a good guy now, is he?
- What are we doing with him?
- Not we, Chuck. You.
- You're about to assume an alias.
- You're going to become the world's most dangerous assassin.
- Becoming an alias, Chuck, is unlike anything you've had in your spy training before.
- Under the most stressful conditions, you have to react only like Rafe, not Chuck.
- Guys, please.
- I think I know a thing or two about acting, all right?
- I happened to play Perchik in my high school's production of Fiddler on the Roof.
- And I was really quite good.
- Ow! Ow!
- What'd you do that for? ! I'm proving a point.
- Everything you think and feel, Chuck, even your innate reflexes have to change.
- The kind of people that Gruber associates with will k\*ll first, ask questions later.
- Yeah, okay fine, I get it. What's the plan?
- Well, Casey is going to elicit the details from Gruber, whom he's meeting, where and when.
- Then you'll go in as Gruber, take his place.
- Well, good luck there.
- It's gonna be tough getting information like that out of a top assassin like Rafe.
- Nah, I can be very persuasive.
- Hey, let me talk to him for a second. Step off, Bartowski.
- I got a job to do. Yeah, well, hey, so do I, okay?
- I've got to learn about Rafe so I can get into character for my mission.
- For example: Assassin is not normally a booth one finds at Career Day.
- How'd you initially get interested in this line of work?
- Why would I tell you anything?
- I can think of one burning reason why.
- Okay. How about this one: What was your most difficult hit?
- I'll take the torture over this man's questions. Roger that.
- I'll take the torture over this man's questions.
- Hey, it's just a phone.
- Gruber here.
- Of course I'm ready.
- Who do you think you're dealing with?
- Yeah, yeah, I know where that is.
- Across the street from the cupcake place.
- Because I like cupcakes, that's why.
- Who doesn't like a good cupcake?
- I'll be there.
- Not bad, Bartowski.
- Who the hell is Bartowski?
- Look at that guy.
- Chuck's the greatest lady k\*ll Burbank has ever seen.
- He's a real "Chuck" magnet.
- Please with the puns.
- Terrible timing for my number one employee Morgan to be away at a leadership seminar.
- Due to a clerical oversight, we received triple the number of Crock-Pots I may have intended.
- I'm excited about dinner tonight.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, me, too.
- What's that guy's secret with women?
- What, has he got some kind of deal with the devil?
- I've narrowed it down.
- Either mind controlling LSD or sorcery.
- El g\*n School of Finance has taught me when you try to sell a house, bake some cookies.
- Make the place smell familiar.
- We're gonna do the same thing here.
- Except with gumbo.
- Folks smell something cooking in that Crock-Pot, make them want to buy the fool thing.
- Need a volunteer.
- You look like you've peeled a few spuds in your day, Casey.
- And I would have picked you if these two dipsticks hadn't been faking sick to get out of chopping and dicing.
- Wash your filthy hands, boys.
- Hey, um, I'm cooking dinner tonight for my family, Hannah, and my special chicken pepperoni recipe takes a little time to prep, so I don't know how long the mission is, but I need a hard out by 5:00. Mm.
- I can give you a hard out with these five.
- Get your priorities straight.
- You okay in here?
- Yeah, yeah. I'll be out in a sec.
- I see how that guy looks at you.
- I bet he has no clue what to do to a beautiful woman like you.
- But I do.
- I will take such good care of you, sweetheart.
- All set.
- Quick thing I gotta do first.
- Okay, ready when you are.
- Hi.
- I miss those lips.
- What, these old things?
- I'm gonna be thinking about last night when I'm on my install.
- What are you doing today?
- Yeah, same thing, install.
- Big, huge, complicated.
- Probably faking my way through most of it.
- But hey, how about I come and pick you up before dinner?
- That's great.
- Definitely a deal with the devil.
- I am so lonely.
- Come on.
- I can pass for a cold-blooded k\*ll, right?
- What happened to Rafe?
- What?
- Imbecile can't go in alone.
- Hey, where am I going?
- Chuck, Rafe wasn't going to meet with your usual spies.
- These guys are a little more old-fashioned.
- Heard a story this cugine whacked this guy during his spaghetti dinner.
- The coroner couldn't tell between the marinara and the mess.
- Hey, boss, someone to see you.
- Well, well, well, Rafe Gruber.
- Your reputation precedes you.
- This is my coworker.
- You may call him John.
- How ya doin'?
- John doesn't talk much.
- I know you from somewhere?
- Doubt it.
- When we had previous dealings with our mutual friends, you had more trepidation about letting us I.D. you.
- Not many people have seen my face and lived.
- Consider it an honor.
- Look, I'm not much for foreplay, so forgive me if I'm a little rude.
- Who's my target?
- No one thinks this guy looks familiar?
- You got cousins in Philly?
- No.
- I'm a huge fan of your work.
- Can I ask you something?
- What was your toughest hit?
- You want to know my toughest hit?
- Look, I was just asking.
- Yeah, take it easy, boss.
- You shut your mouth!
- You think it's okay to ask a guy you just met something personal like that?
- I really didn't mean no disrespect, I swear.
- Your toughest assignment's always your next one.
- You forget that, then you die.
- You okay, Walker?
- Yeah, yeah, it's just this alias thing.
- It must be a lot for Chuck.
- He's not a very good liar.
- Listen to him.
- He's completely living the lie.
- I know, but he's not like you and me.
- We're both used to living somebody else's life.
- That's the job.
- Yeah, but where does the job end?
- I can barely remember who I am anymore.
- CHUCK I'm a busy guy, so what's the name?
- Who do our mutual friends want me to k\*ll?
- The guy's name is... I remember now!
- You look like this hotshot sn\*per I served with a while back.
- Name Alex Coburn, ring a bell?
- What are you trying to say?
- Simple. This guy isn't who he says he is.
- Maybe he's some kind of fed.
- Damn it! Casey's been made.
- We need to get them out of there.
- How are we supposed to do that without getting everybody else k\*ll?
- We need that name, Walker.
- We need to know who the Ring wants dead.
- Are you implying that this guy, my guy, is a cop?
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
- So what does that say about you?
- If he's a cop...
- I'll k\*ll him myself.
- Do him, Rafe!
- What are you waiting for?
- Quit stalling. Keep stalling, Chuck.
- We need more time.
- We're waiting for backup.
- Time's running out.
- k\*ll him.
- I'm not a m\*rder.
- I'm an assassin!
- What's the damn difference?
- What's the damn difference?
- I don't k\*ll because I like it.
- I k\*ll because it's a means to something.
- In this case, information.
- Information that I wouldn't get from a dead guy per your suggestion!
- Now you're gonna tell me, who's your informant?
- Who's the leak?
- Why would I tell you anything?
- Sell it.
- Wait!
- I got something special for occasions such as these.
- Is this stuff sterile?
- I take pride in my work, all right?
- I want to k\*ll him, not some secondary infection.
- No.
- Tell me what you know!
- Move!
- Move, move, move!
- Everyone, move it! Move it!
- Oh, my God, Sarah!
- Sarah, I'm freaking out right now!
- I've never been so happy to see you in my life!
- Stop it!
- You're not you, you're Rafe.
- You have to be him in this situation.
- Think what he would do. Live the lie.
- Come on, move! We gotta split up!
- We'll contact you later with your assignment!
- Rafe, You're incredible!
- Yeah, whatever. It's my job.
- Good work, team.
- Wow, Bartowski really sold it.
- For a second, I hardly even recognized him.
- Guys, I told you I needed a hard-out at 5:00!
- How am I gonna get everything done?
- I gotta cook dinner, my apartment's a pigsty, gotta pick up Hannah, take a shower...
- Where is everybody?
- Walker and Shaw knew you were in over your head.
- They went back to your place to fix dinner for your date. They did, huh?
- Weird, huh?
- Walker helping you get laid.
- Um, hey, Casey, I'm... I'm sorry about your tooth.
- That's all right. At least you got one with a cavity.
- Saved me a trip to the dentist.
- You did good work, Chuck.
- Proud of you.
- You think you can be me?
- You shut your mouth.
- Where are you taking Rafe?
- Interrogation. Just wish I could do it myself.
- You think you can be me? !
- Uh, Case, back there on the mission, I flashed on the name "Alex Coburn. " Who is that?
- You mind your damn business.
- Oh, hey!
- Hi!
- Let's go eat.
- I'm not gonna lie to you, boys, Bartowski is k\*ll it with the ladies.
- I know.
- First there was that hot girl from Stanford.
- Jill. Yeah.
- Then the brunette with the overpriced deli.
- Lou. She was a fine, miniature piece of woman.
- And now Hannah.
- I'd like to moisturize her feet with my saliva.
- Don't you get it? None of them matter.
- Chuck may try to replace her, but when he's with Sarah, the light in his eyes shines brightly.
- Damn onions!
- Oh, kn\*fe.
- I want expectations to be managed here.
- I'm not Chef Boyardee.
- Just looking forward to hanging out with your sister.
- I like this one, Chuck.
- Oh, my God, Chuck, this looks amazing.
- And smells amazing, too.
- Dude, I thought you worked all day.
- How'd you find time to do this?
- Um, you know, it's a, it's a juggling act.
- No biggie. I just threw it together.
- Uh, Devon, you want to help me with the wine?
- Smells delish.
- My taste buds are fist bumping each other, bro.
- Red okay?
- Listen, I didn't do any of this, okay?
- I didn't buy the cheese.
- I didn't make the dinner.
- Thank God, I can tell you the truth.
- Stop. Stop.
- If you keep talking, I'm going to have to lie to your sister, and I can't do that anymore.
- I'm not cut out for this, Chuck.
- I'm not like you.
- I'm sorry. I get it.
- Look, from now on, if Ellie asks you something, just say, "I don't know. " That's not a lie.
- I lied.
- I'm a liar.
- I've been telling you for years that I love this dish.
- And it's been horrible.
- And now, I can tell you, honestly, that this is fantastic.
- Well, yeah. I think you're just, you're just being polite.
- It's not really my best.
- No, it is, actually.
- The others were quite horrible.
- Devon, can you believe that Chuck made this?
- I don't know.
- Isn't this chicken moist?
- Chuck's chicken?
- This chicken?
- Chuck's chicken.
- Um...
- Hannah, don't you think Chuck's chicken is moist?
- Actually, I, um...
- I'd like to make a toast.
- Um, you know how, in life, there's always something that just doesn't line up?
- Like, um, either you're working at the wrong job or dating the wrong guy, or you're eating some really bad meal?
- Uh, but right at this second, I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.
- And I want to thank all of you for making me feel that way.
- Hope dessert doesn't suck.
- Um, cheers.
- Cheers.
- I managed to sneak us out some chicken.
- I don't want to brag, but it turned out pretty good.
- Oh, uh, no, thanks. I'm not hungry.
- I'm clocking out. Have you got this covered?
- Uh, yeah.
- This is cool.
- Is this new?
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah. Little perk of the job.
- You know, just testing it out. Work thing.
- Listen, I, um, I know this is fast, but my parents are coming in from Santa Barbara tonight for dinner.
- Oh. Yeah, and I wasn't going to ask you to come, but since I got to hang out with your family, I'd love it if you met mine.
- Yeah, yeah. I would love to meet them.
- Bartowski, I need your professional opinion.
- Your latest little lady said that you're some kind of cooking expert.
- I need your palette's advice.
- Uh, actually, you know, my recipe last night didn't really come together.
- That's not what she said.
- She said she couldn't wait to gobble up every bite.
- Mouth as pretty as Hannah's, she can taste the difference.
- That's the mouth of a professional.
- Hello? Burbank Buy More.
- The-the flavor profile's not quite right.
- I think it could use a little Worcestershire sauce, maybe.
- And, oh, oh, wait. Is that frozen okra?
- Good taste in women, bad taste in food.
- Jeffrey, if you double-dip, we all may die.
- Who was that? What did they want?
- Um, it was a wrong number.
- They were asking for some guy named Rafe.
- That's odd. What did you tell him?
- Um, I told them that this was a Buy More phone.
- Uh, but the guy? Just, he wouldn't listen, and he kept saying that he would be here, in like, two minutes.
- Oh, here.
- What do you think you're doing with that watch?
- I can explain.
- There is no explanation.
- Give me this watch.
- For a bad ass k\*ll to own such a piece of crap watch?
- Crazy!
- So, we bought you a little present, though "bought" is a very loose term.
- Look at that.
- Gold. Wow. It's very understated.
- What are you doing here at Buy More, anyway?
- What, are you getting some speaker wire to, uh...
- What do I look like, a workaholic?
- A man's got to have hobbies other than m\*rder.
- I was here browsing music.
- Hey, you saved us from getting pinched yesterday, huh?
- What a guy. Ooh, I could hit you.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Never seen anything close to what you pulled off, Rafe.
- The trick is making it look easy.
- You did us a favor, and in turn, we did you a favor.
- We tracked down the location of the guy you're supposed to k\*ll.
- Good news, huh?
- Good news?
- That is very good news.
- Yeah. Enough of that.
- Oh, I'm sorry if this is a bad time.
- No. Hey, Walker. Come on in.
- Listen, Shaw, I just wanted to say, um...
- What?
- Well, I-I came by to, um...
- I'm sorry. Can you please put some clothes on?
- Oh. Yeah.
- I wanted to apologize for my behavior last night.
- No apology necessary.
- Okay.
- Um...
- Well...
- You still, um...
- You okay with this whole Chuck/Hannah thing?
- Thank you for asking.
- But that's not really the change that I'm having trouble with.
- So, who's the mark?
- Who am I taking out?
- He's in the hotel room right over there.
- Got a girl with him.
- A real hot piece of tail.
- I think they're going to plow.
- Perfect distraction.
- How am I supposed to see him?
- With this.
- Naturally.
- We hear you're one of five guys that can make this sh\*t.
- It's over half a mile away.
- Well, apparently, my reputation precedes me.
- Again.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
- SARAH It's just really difficult to see Chuck become a different person.
- That's the mission, Walker.
- No, it's not the mission. It's...
- Everything.
- Take the sh\*t.
- It's how he pulled out Casey's tooth, and how he burnt that asset a couple of weeks ago, and the way he lies to Hannah.
- I mean, it's so easy for him.
- Chuck's changing.
- He's becoming a spy.
- I know. I know.
- But lives are being affected here.
- Sounds like he's not the only one who's changing.
- It's like I'm watching Chuck disappear, and the further he gets from who he is, the... Cap him.
- It's okay. Talk to me, Sarah.
- Come on.
- Well, the more I want to remember who I am- who I was before all of this-
- Well, if this is you, I like you.
- I want more.
- I've been on this assignment for almost three years, and I've never told anybody my real name.
- Not even Chuck?
- No.
- Not even Chuck.
- So, what is it?
- What's happening?
- What's going on? Shut up! Shut up!
- Feels so weird to say it out loud.
- Yeah, it's just, you never seemed like a Sarah.
- It's 'cause I'm not.
- What is it, Rafe?
- I'm Sam.
- Hmm.
- My real name is Sam.
- Sam?
- Well...
- I'm going to kiss you now, Sam.
- Sam? !
- Sam?
- Who's Sam?
- The guy you're supposed to whack is Daniel Shaw.
- The organization that had us contract you thought this Shaw guy was dead.
- Turns out, he's just not dead yet.
- This is the right guy all right.
- So, who the hell is Sam?
- Sam...
- Sam's the girl.
- My girl.
- Sort of.
- Me and Sam are on again, off again.
- Driving everyone in my life a little crazy.
- I hate those "Will they or won't they? " things.
- Just do it already!
- If you and this girl love each other so much, what's keeping you apart?
- It's complicated.
- Sort of came down to a question of work.
- What are you gonna do?
- You got your priorities straight.
- Right?
- And plus, she's the one who's always pushing me to be better at my job in the first place.
- Women- screwed if you do, not screwed if you don't.
- Wait a second.
- The guy you're supposed to whack is banging your girl?
- It sure seems that way, doesn't it? Huh.
- Jeez, this unlucky guy is about to get double dead.
- SHAW Do we have a situation?
- I tried contacting the agents transporting Gruber, but they're not responding.
- They checked in yet?
- No. Damn it!
- Get me Bartowski's last-known location.
- What are you waiting on, Rafe?
- There.
- That's better.
- What's your problem, man?
- Ice him! I can't do it.
- A b\*llet's too good for this guy.
- Yeah, you gotta look this jerk in the eye before you cap him.
- Yeah, yeah, my thoughts exactly.
- I'm going over there.
- You two stay put.
- Don't worry, Rafe. We got your back.
- Anything weird goes down, I'll take out the whole room.
- I ain't a marksman like you are, but I make sure they're all dead.
- Yeah, that's... real good.
- Open the door!
- I know you're in there!
- I will kick this door down!
- What's going on?
- Shut your mouth! I'll deal with you later.
- What's your problem? My problem is that nobody messes with Rafe Gruber.
- They're watching us.
- I'd like you to remove those.
- No, no, no. These are the hands that are gonna k\*ll you, Shaw.
- What are you doing? !
- You stole my girl.
- I'm going to end you for taking Sam!
- You had your chance and you blew it.
- Who the hell are you?
- Ah, Shaw, wait!
- Shaw, enough!
- Would you stop already?
- I'm trying to sell myself as Rafe!
- They're across the street with a sn\*per r\*fle.
- They're gonna k\*ll all of us!
- No, I'm gonna k\*ll all of you.
- Come on. Flash.
- Flash!
- Come on! Flash!
- Wake up, pretty.
- Come on. That's it.
- That's it.
- Come here, yeah.
- No, don't sh\*\*t! Please don't!
- You two got it bad for this blond.
- Can't say I blame you.
- I'm gonna make it easy on both of you.
- Take her out of the equation.
- No!
- Five people in the world can make this sh\*t, huh?
- Guess I'm one of them.
- Hi.
- Um... you said that I could come to you if I ever needed to talk.
- Yeah. I'm so glad.
- Please, start at the beginning.
- I feel like I'm living a lie, Ellie.
- I used to be able to compartmentalize these things, but it's, like, it's all the time now.
- It never stops.
- I feel like I'm not me anymore.
- I think I know what this is about.
- You do?
- Maybe things are moving too fast with Hannah, and even though you really like her, it feels dishonest because the truth is that you still have feelings for Sarah.
- Does that sound about right?
- See, this is... this is why I don't come talk to you, Ellie, 'cause you're half a spy.
- I'm sorry, Chuck, maybe that's not it.
- No. No, no, no.
- What I mean by that is that you're an excellent half a spy.
- Thanks.
- Any time.
- Hi!
- Hi. I'm, uh, I'm Chuck.
- Can we talk for a second?
- Oh, yeah.
- Sorry.
- Are you okay, Chuck?
- What's the matter?
- You know how much I like you, right?
- What's wrong?
- Hannah, there are things in my life that you can't understand, and I can't explain them to you.
- I've been dishonest, and it's not fair to you.
- So I have to end this... because you deserve to be with someone who you can know completely and...
- I, um, I thought you were a nice guy.
- No, I am a nice guy.

- I hope that your lies keep you warm at night.

- It's a Crock-Pot. They're practically giving them away at Buy More.

- Thank you... Sam.
