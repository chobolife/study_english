# Chuck Versus the American Hero

- Hey, I'm Chuck. Here's a few things that you might need to know or maybe you just forgot.
- There's only one piece left to clean up.
- Perry. Chuck has to k\*ll him.
- You are giving him his red test tonight?
- u kidding me? k\*ll him here, now?
- I can't do that.
- Then you won't become a spy.
- You passed the test. To them you k\*ll perry.
- No one can know the truth ever. Not even Sarah.
- You're now officially an agent.
- Included there's a plain ticket to washington, you'll leave tonight.
- Chuck: First day. Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous.
- (elevator bell dings)
- What floor? Five.
- No, not five.
- Oh, hey, uh, I'm so sorry to bother you.
- You wouldn't happen to know what floor General Beckman is on?
- They told me at the front desk and I-I just totally forgot.
- You couldn't miss her. She's real little, lots of medals, red hair.
- Nice, nice, friendly conversation.
- That's good. I'm glad we did that.
- No!
- Sir?
- Excuse me, sir.
- This is a restricted floor.
- I need a badge and a signature.
- Sir, I can't let you examine a body without an authorized NSA badge.
- Would you do me a favor?
- Just... one step.
- (scoffs)
- There, perfect.
- What do you think you're doing? !
- (silenced g\*n)
- (device trills)
- It's done.
- Package is intact.
- NSA, General Beckman's office. Please hold.
- NSA, General Beckman's office. Please hold.
- Thank you for waiting.
- Here we are. Thank God.
- Hello. Thank you for waiting.
- How's it going?
- NSA, General Beckman's office. Please hold.
- Super.
- Thank you for waiting.
- Hello. Thank you for waiting.
- Yes, I'll put you right through.
- Excuse me. Hi, my name's...
- Have a seat, Agent Bartowski.
- The General knows you're here.
- NSA.
- Right. Yeah, of course she knows I'm here.
- NSA, General Beckman's office. Please hold.
- (gasps)
- Oh, God, these things are incredibly uncomfortable.
- Is there a particular place that you like to put this?
- 'Cause I'm always having...
- Oh, right, yes. (chuckles)
- Sorry about... Finger always on the slide, and you know, totally empty so...
- But I hear you. Safety first.
- A pleasure as always, General.
- The pleasure's all mine, Diane.
- Mr. Bartowski. Oh!
- For God's sake, put that g\*n away. You're a spy now.
- Well, that's, that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about, General.
- Your first assignment just arrived.
- The CIA wants you in Rome right away.
- Uh, what? Excuse me, right away?
- Mm-hmm. You will be posing as a independently wealthy young expatriate.
- That way, your jet-setting lifestyle and influential associates won't draw attention.
- Here is where you'll be staying.
- Uh, wow.
- Obviously, you will be afforded all the accoutrements that go with it: cars, clothes, a yearly stipend.
- Huh? What? Yearly?
- Yearly stipend?
- This is all moving very, very fast, don't you think?
- The NSA has spent three years and countless millions of dollars helping you reach your potential.
- There's nothing fast about it.
- I get that. I do.
- I do, General, and I certainly don't want to come across as being ungrateful for the, the villa or the car or the stipend.
- I'm just not sure that I am really ready to pack up and move somewhere to live this whole new life when I'm just starting to become comfortable with the life I'm living... right now, you know?
- What exactly did you think we were training you for, Mr. Bartowski?
- I don't... I don't really know what to say, General.
- I'm sorry.
- Is not an option!
- (sighs)
- (clears throat)
- I understand that the hand-wringing and the second-guessing are all part of your process.
- Here's what I'm offering: take the week off, anywhere you want, on us.
- But afterwards, I expect you back in Washington and ready to assemble your team.
- Is that understood?
- Hang on. Um, back up a second.
- What do you mean by "my" team?
- You didn't think we were going to send you to Rome alone?
- You'll have your pick of our top agents, whoever you want.
- So where will we be sending you, Mr. Bartowski?
- Bali? Bora Bora?
- Burbank.
-  Bob Hope Airport, to be exact.
- I see.
- And will you be requiring a companion ticket?
- No, thanks.
- She's still there.
- That's, uh, that's fantastic news. Okay.
- Thank you.
- Enough of the su3pense, babe.
- One word, Devon: Africa.
- Africa?
- That was the hospital.
- I didn't even have to ask.
- Out of the blue, they just offered me a sabbatical. I have a year off.
- Do you know what that means?
- Africa.
- We can do Doctors without Borders, follow our dreams, whatever you want.
- What about Chuck?
- Chuck is moving on, you know?
- I really believe that this time.
- He said he was on a business trip for Buy More in Washington.
- Yeah, yeah, he did sound pretty pumped when I talked to him.
- Who knows where he'll end up. Who knows?
- Honey, there's nothing keeping us here.
- (chuckles)
- (chuckles)
- Africa.
- I've never had to win a girl back, buddy, so I stopped by the store on the way here.
- I got Sarah a bunch of stuff.
- What do you think? Am I overdoing it? Hmm-mmm.
- You think I'm overdoing it. I'm overdoing it.
- Well, the chocolates are a nice touch, I guess, t buy her back, if that makes any sense.
- I know, I know, you're right.
- It just finally clicked for me, you know?
- Sarah is, is the most important thing.
- I mean, what's the point of being a spy without her?
- I've got to win her back, and I've only got a small window of opportunity to do it in before I have to leave for Rome.
- Hey. Did you just say you're gonna go to Rome?
- Yeah, my new assignment starts there next week.
- Then you are still leaving. Thank God!
- I just fed Ellie some story about you working for Buy More corporate.
- She won't go to Africa if you're still here.
- Well, I'm not going anywhere without Sarah.
- Then let's get you two kids back together.
- Shouldn't be too difficult, huh?
- You seen the stallion she's dating?
- Casey, do you... ?
- Do, do you ever knock or use a door?
- Shaw's not some geek who likes to talk about his feelings all day long. He's a real spy.
- Oh. Oh, really? Is that so?
- Well, apparently, you haven't heard because you no longer work for the United States government, but I'm heading up my own undercover operation.
- In Rome. And I get to choose my own team.
- Really? Anyone?
- Including a civilian with extensive military background?
- Take a number, Casey.
- Chuck, I speak fluent Italian.
- Menu items mostly.
- I'd be an invaluable asset.
- Listen, guys, I got to get Sarah back first.
- Then we can start talking about a team.
- What are we waiting for, fellas?
- Let's help the guy get his girl back. Come on!
- Yeah, so Ellie and I can go to Africa.
- And I can get out of Burbank.
- I can finally go see Rome.
- Maybe meet a nice Italian girl.
- See the Vatican... pay my respects to the Pope.
- Devon: What are you waiting for, lover boy?
- Hey, um...
- You're back.
- I've been calling you for, for a couple days now.
- You know, there's a lot we need to talk about.
- I know. I'm sorry.
- It's been a little...
- Crazy. Yeah, I know.
- Beckman flew me to D. C.
- I got my badge. It's official now.
- I'm an agent.
- Congratulations. You earned it.
- You know the CIA-- they're sending me to Italy.
- You wouldn't believe the villa that they're putting me up in.
- I'm supposed to be some rich young playboy.
- But who cares about that?
- The point is, Sarah...
- I want you to go with me.
- Chuck, I can't.
- No, Beckman said I get to choose my own team, cream of the crop. That's you.
- I'm going to Washington, okay? And I'm going with Shaw.
- Wait a minute.
- Wasn't this the plan?
- There's nothing stopping us from being together now.
- I passed my spy test.
- That's why I can't be with you, okay?
- You're not... you're not the same guy that I fell for.
- How? Why? Because I'm an agent now?
- How am I not the same guy?
- You k\*ll somebody, Chuck. I saw you k\*ll the mole!
- Sarah, I know what you think you saw on the train tracks, but it's not that simple.
- It's more complicated than that. and I need you to believe me.
- I don't.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- Congratulations on your promotion, Special Agent Bartowski.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you. Yeah, it's, uh... it's very exciting.
- So what brings you back to Burbank?
- Um... I, uh, you know, just, uh, just-just tying up a few loose ends.
- Actually, Chuck was just wondering if I had any last-minute advice on his new assignment in Rome.
- Well, you shouldn't have come to her.
- You should have come to me.
- I was stationed there for two years.
- Come on. I can tell you everything you need to know.
- Oh, great.
- Hey.
- How'd it go with Walker?
- Because she thinks I k\*ll the mole, she believes I'm no longer the guy she fell in love with.
- I have to tell her the truth.
- What? That I k\*ll him? Not gonna happen.
- Casey, you said it yourself. The guy was a traitor.
- Yeah, well, according to Beckman, so am I.
- I'm lucky she didn't put a b\*llet in my head.
- Get her back some other way.
- Well, what the heck am I supposed to tell Sarah?
- Tell her whatever you want, just not the truth.
- You like being a full-fledged spy, don't you?
- You like that nice villa the CIA picked out for you in Rome, hmm?
- Then you k\*ll the mole. That's how it's got to be.
- Morgan: Okay, okay.
- How did it go? How did it go?
- Crashed and b\*rned.
- Chuck, did you tell her how you feel?
- Forget it.
- She's leaving with Shaw in the morning.
- Chuck: I'm sorry, guys. It's over.
- I'm going to get some fresh air, and figure out how I'm going to tell Beckman I'm quitting.
- There goes our chance to ever get out of the Buy More.
- Really? Is that what they teach you in the Marine Corps?
- Hmm?
- Roll over and die?
- This isn't exactly combat, Morgan.
- That's where you're wrong, Casey.
- Because love? Love is a battlefield.
- Huh.
- Hey, fellas.
- Need your help.
- Actually, Chuck needs your help.
- Went and lost his old lady again, huh?
- Yeah. How did you know that?
- We know everything.
- The eyes and the ears of the strip mall, my friend.
- Chuck better move quick if he wants to get his froyo ho back.
- Another fella sniffing around the orange.
- Orange.
- Guy knows how to fill out a pair of slacks.
- If you know what I'm saying.
- No, I don't.
- I didn't notice that.
- (shushing)
- You want us to put a tail on blondie's new piece?
- Find out his weaknesses, see what skeletons are in his closet?
- bl\*od sample, urine?
- Stool?
- No.
- No, not at... I just...
- I just need to borrow something.
- (engine starting)
- (tires screeching)
- Whoa! Whoa!
- What the crap is going on?
- You guys scared the bejeezus out of me.
- We're here to help you reacquire Agent Walker.
- Guys, listen. You don't understand.
- No, Chuck, you don't understand.
- You're not the only one with something at stake here, Chuck.
- Yeah, we help you get the girl back, you help us get out of Burbank.
- Think of it as a test run for Rome.
- Morgan: What do you think, boss?
- Hey, get dressed. Reservation's in ten minutes.
- Reservation for what? Come on.
- Chuck: Guys. Is this Jeff's van?
- Casey: Go, go, go!
- (tires screeching)
- Darn, he's on the move.
- Guys, what are we doing here?
- It's Shaw's date.
- Morgan: Wow. That guy can fill out a pair of slacks.
- Sarah's with a stallion. Huh.
- Don't listen to him, Chuck.
- We have a plan.
- You've got nothing to worry about, man.
- Man: Target is in position, sir.
- Looks like a romantic dinner.
- Sorry, Shaw.
- 1990 Chateau Latour. Excellent choice.
- Shaw: Thank you.
- Knowledge of fine wine. Very classy.
- He just ordered for both of them.
- That's a power move, bro.
- Yeah. Guy's a closer.
- Guys, guys.
- A little sensitivity would really go a long way.
- Just a smidgeon. A skosh. A dab.
- We're talking about the girl I love here.
- I'm sorry.
- What could you possibly be sorry for?
- This is amazing.
- It's just...
- I'm sorry that we haven't done this sooner.
- This is nice.
- No, it's perfect.
- Being here with you.
- Shaw: To a new life and a fresh start.
- No Burbank, no baggage.
- All right, this isn't good.
- Why doesn't John here just drag him out of there?
- I'm afraid my days of legalized body snatching are over, guys.
- I'm a civilian now.
- This one's on you, Bartowski.
- All right, Chuck. Whatever you do, do not go in there too hot.
- You will scare her away.
- Negative. Okay?
- Chuck has to lay it all on the line.
- Shaw, he may be handsome and worldly and know his way around a menu, but, man, he's stiff as a board.
- Where's that Bartowski charm?
- The pizzazz? You flash a smile, you go in there and you...
- Morgan, why don't you let me handle it? Okay?
- No offense, but I've had my fair share of ladies.
- 'Cause you live in a bubble.
- Okay? Take a look at yourself.
- Go ahead.
- It's a freakish bubble of handsomeness.
- Now, look at me.
- No bubble. No bubble.
- I got to be completely verbal.
- Now, Chuck, I'm telling you, you just go in and you be fun and you be witty, and you be the charming guy she fell for.
- Yeah?
- Okay. Okay, fine.
- But what about Shaw?
- Just worry about the girl.
- I'll take care of the stallion.
- Sorry to disturb you, but, Mr. Shaw, you have a phone call.
- Target's on the move.
- Deep voice (on phone): Agent Shaw.
- I'm an operative of The Ring.
- If you want to save everyone in this restaurant, you will listen to my instructions very carefully.
- (deep voice): You will do everything that I say.
- Where the hell do you think you're going?
- Exit the restaurant. Side door.
- And head to the back alley.
- We've lost visual on the target.
- Bring up the phone dub.
- Deep voice (on speaker): Stay cool and nobody will get hurt.
- Who the hell is that?
- Is this seat taken?
- Chuck, what are you doing here?
- I'm here for you.
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to say that u'll come with me to Rome.
- Well, you know that I can't, and you know why.
- Look, Sarah, I don't want to have to make a scene in front of all these very nice people, but I will literally do anything to change your mind.
- Well, then tell me what really happened at the train tracks.
- Sarah: If you didn't k\*ll the mole, then who did?
- Look, I don't want there to be any secrets or lies between us, ever again.
- So, please, let me just have this one.
- And I promise I will never lie to you.
- There you will head to a pay phone.
- The southwest corner. Do it.
- But do it slowly.
- Deep voice (over speakers): Slowly.
- Not one of ours.
- Take him down.
- (trilling)
- We know exactly what you look like, Shaw.
- 6'2", 220, black hair, very attractive.
- (cocking g\*n)
- Next move, you're to wait for a phone call.
- Might not happen right away.
- So be patient. And then, when you...
- (gasps in deep voice)
- Do you have any idea who these people are?
- What they're capable of?
- Mm-mmm. Nope?
- Listen.
- I know that you think I'm not that same guy that you met the first day at the Buy More.
- And you know what? You're right.
- Okay? You're right.
- The guy that I was back then hated himself for not knowing what he wanted to do with the rest of his life or who he wanted to spend it with, but now?
- Finally, now... I know.
- I want to be a spy.
- And I want to be with you.
- Morgan: Hey, it's just a harmless prank.
- Listen, you have to understand...
- Who are they?
- Is that a taser?
- Sorry about this. Oh, boy.
- (Morgan wailing, electricity crackling)
- Sarah.
- Man down.
- I've been tased.
- I can't feel my legs.
- Bring a stretcher, a wheelbarrow.
- Possible change of pants.
- Casey, you got to do something.
- He's g\*n for Chuck.
- I'm a civilian now. I can't.
- Well, I can.
- Daniel.
- If you're going to sh\*\*t me, just do it.
- Put a b\*llet in my head.
- b\*llet?
- The director wants to meet with you face to face.
- What are you saying?
- Sarah, I'm saying... that I...
- (both groaning and coughing)
- (tires screech)
- (police siren wailing)
- (indistinct radio transmission)
- Next time, take out the guy with the g\*n.
- Jail? Seriously, you guys? Jail?
- I mean, Morgan, I would have expected this from you.
- Or even from Casey, now that we have all been privy to your public indecency problem.
- But, Devon, I never expected this from you.
- No, babe. I am so sorry.
- You know what?
- Just save the apology. Okay?
- I want answers.
- I want the truth. I want you guys to tell me everything.
- The truth?
- Yes.
- The truth is...
- We were, uh, helping Chuck.
- Chuck is in D. C. , Casey.
- Well, he was. He's back to win back Sarah, so...
- Hold on for a minute.
- You guys expect me to believe that the three of you got my husband b\*at up and tossed in jail to save my brother's love life?
- Yes. Yes, we did.
- We're as shocked as you are.
- And, what's more, Chuck came to you three for advice.
- Before me.
- Yeah. Yes, he did.
- Why am I not surprised this ended in jail?
- (groans)
- Agent Shaw, we have just received intel that the Ring agent who tried to capture you is the same man who removed a data drive from inside the mole's body.
- The data was inside him?
- He was in the process of digesting it when he was k\*ll.
- I'll spare you the gory details.
- Lucky he was dead first.
- We believe the stolen data drive contains highly sensitive case files.
- Your new mission is to bring back those files.
- General, if I may, it's not good enough.
- Excuse me, Agent Shaw.
- You have a better idea?
- The Ring agent we encountered did not want to k\*ll me.
- He wanted to take me to the director.
- If the Ring wants to take me, let them.
- You're volunteering to be a double agent?
- I'm volunteering to be a bull's-eye.
- I'll paint a target on the Ring from within.
- I can get close to the director and track his location.
- And then what?
- It's your call, General, but I'd suggest you launch an air strike.
- Shouldn't we stop and ask what the Ring wants with you in the first place?
- And why they want you alive?
- It doesn't matter.
- We can decimate the Ring's command structure with a single mission.
- I see the merits.
- But you do recognize the danger?
- General.
- This is the moment I've been waiting for... we've been waiting for.
- A singular opportunity.
- Whatever the risk may be, I say it's worth it.
- Very good.
- Make it work.
- Are you trying to get yourself k\*ll?
- You're asking if I'd trade my life for the man who k\*ll my wife?
- I would.
- Well, what if I don't let you?
- It's not your choice.
- (beeping)
- (whirring)
- Man: Hello?
- This is Daniel Shaw.
- I believe you've been looking for me.
- I'm ready to come in.
- It's done.
- Ellie, hey.
- Um, look, I can explain.
- Chuck, listen to me. No. I know exactly what you're going to say.
- And you're absolutely right.
- It was completely immature of me to get everyone involved like that.
- Chuck, you're not listening.
- Stupid? Maybe stupid's the word you're looking for.
- I get it. I went too far.
- You didn't go far enough, Chuck.
- Sarah is special. I know it.
- You know it. If you love her, if she's the one, then you don't stop. You don't quit.
- You never go too far.
- You are a Bartowski, Chuck.
- Start acting like one.
- Shaw, please. You're moving too fast.
- You're not thinking this through.
- Hey, we're spies, Walker.
- Let's start acting like it.
- But you don't have to do this.
- There's got to be another way.
- It's the only way to be sure.
- I have to do this.
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.
- Sarah: What's that?
- It's how you'll find me.
- This will give Beckman the coordinates for the air strike.
- (clears throat) Wow.
- You just...
- You just swallowed that thing whole, huh?
- No-No water to wash it down.
- Take care of her, Chuck.
- Uh...
- Where is he going?
- Shaw is turning himself in to the Ring.
- He's leading us to them.
- He's sacrificing himself, Chuck.
- Oh.
- (beeps)
- I never should have let Morgan lay his dirty little hands on Loretta.
- She's a sweet van, my friend.
- That van's my retirement, dude.
- And they took the van and they left us.
- That is a slap in the face.
- It's insulting.
- Do they have any idea how much stalking experience I have?
- If only they did, Jeffrey.
- You're very prolific.
- You're the-the Picasso of creepiness.
- It's true. And this is my Blue period.
- Good. There's the guy.
- Blondie's new boyfriend.
- We need to demonstrate our worth.
- Show them that we can stalk with the best of them.
- What do you say, my friend?
- Let's do the dizzle.
- Shaw's going on a su1c1de mission?
- I don't care what he says.
- I am not letting him go in alone.
- (typing)
- He's not going in alone.
- (alarm blares)
- Chuck, what are you doing?
- Shaw needs help.
- I know he does.
- And that's why I'm going in to bring him back.
- But the air strike is on its way.
- You're both going to get k\*ll.
- Why are you helping him?
- 'Cause I know how much you care about him.
- Glad you could make it.
- The director's expecting you.
- Be cool.
- You think he saw us?
- Never.
- Frisk him.
- Stalkee is behind a gray van with another male, possibly for a sexual encounter.
- Both men are physically fit.
- Should be lively.
- Jeffrey?
- Don't make me afraid to be alone with you.
- In case you swallowed a tracker.
- Rather err on the side of caution.
- (screaming and coughing)
- They're much quieter when they're dead.
- (gagging and screaming)
- What do we have here?
- Now we can go see the director.
- This is the exact model our federal government uses when cleaning up hot zones.
- m\*rder investigations.
- So, does this model come with any rebates?
- Huh?
- Morse code.
- Got to run.
- It's on the house.
- (device beeping)
- Oh. Ugh.
- (cell phone ringing)
- Lester, I'm in the middle of something right now.
- I can't talk.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, no, no. No worries. No worries, buddy.
- I, too, am a little bit busy.
- Uh, stalking Sarah's new stallion, as Jeffrey would say.
- You got to be kidding me.
- Lester: Hang up the phone.
- I've been insulted enough.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, no, no, no.
- You guys are stalking Sarah's new stallion?
- Yes, on our off time, to show you what amateurs you're working with.
- Well, can you see him right now?
- No, we're tucked behind a dumpster.
- But it did look like the Stallion and some frat guys were heading into a dingy warehouse or something.
- Dude is into some kinky stuff.
- Okay. Listen, Lester.
- I need you to tell me where you are right now.
- It looks like we're at the corner of 2nd and Alvarado.
- Hey!
- Oh, thank you, Casey.
- I haven't used Morse code since basic training.
- I use it all the time to talk to my Marine buddies. What's up?
- Okay, Shaw gave himself up to the director, and Chuck locked me in here because he knew I would try and rescue him and Beckman's going to b\*mb the location.
- Shaw dies an American hero.
- Not if I can help it.
- Okay, good. He's still on the move.
- Thank you, Casey.
- I'm sorry. I can't let you stay in here.
- Now, Casey.
- (growls)
- Hey!
- Where is he?
- Nice to see you, too.
- Suspects have entered the building.
- That is incredible.
- You guys are, like, the most amazing stalkers I've ever seen.
- I will tell my grandchildren about you.
- Wait. Wanna borrow some brass knuckles?
- Nunchuks?
- Uh, why would you even have...
- No. While I appreciate that, Jeff, very much, I-I-I don't believe in violence.
- So, should they give you a b\*at, you expect us to have your back?
- No, thanks. Okay. See you later.
- â? ª â? ª
- (rattling, beeping)
- Oh.
- Here we go.
- (clicks, whirring)
- (whimpering)
- (panting)
- Wow.
- Tracker's gone subterranean.
- Location is stabilized and remains fixed.
- Agent Shaw has arrived and the B-2 has been deployed with bunker-busters.
- What do you want to do?
- Drop the b\*mb.
- And Agent Shaw?
- He's a true American hero.
- Welcome, Daniel.
- I've been waiting to meet you for a long time.
- If you're going to k\*ll me, get it over with.
- I don't want to k\*ll you, Daniel.
- I want to educate you.
- What is this?
- A gift.
- The answer you've been seeking for all these years.
- (trills)
- (electrical snap)
- MAN (echoing): Max, who loves you...
- (woman laughing)
- Woman: (echoing): Happy birthday.
- Okay, my turn. Give me the camera.
- Maybe it was a bad idea to get you a video for your birthday.
- Come on. Now you're just wasting tape.
- This is ridiculous. Happy birthday.
- How'd you get this?
- We have lots of information on Eve.
- Just watch, Daniel.
- It's time you learned the truth about your wife's m\*rder.
- Thought you might like to see some surveillance footage from that night.
- (g\*n)
- (Danielle gasps)
- No!
- It must be so difficult for you.
- You didn't think I'd come here in person.
- (echoing): I'll be in touch.
- (zapping)
- MAN (over radio): Three minutes to target.
- (g\*n zaps)
- Huh. No flash necessary.
- Good tranqs.
- Freeze!
- Drop it.
- (both groaning)
- (panting)
- Man: We got a lock on the tracker.
- Beckman: Congratulations, Agent Walker. We destroyed a Ring compound, . hopefully eliminating some of their higher-ups, and you managed to rescue Agent Shaw.
- Once again, you and your team prevail.
- I can't take any of the credit, General.
- It was all Chuck. He saved Shaw by himself.
- Duly noted.
- Well, Agent Walker, it's been a highly memorable three years in Burbank.
- I look forward to working face-to-face with you in Washington.
- Have a safe flight.
- How's Shaw doing?
- He's still unconscious, but the doctors say he'll make a full recovery, thanks to you.
- Well, I mean, you know he would have done the same for me.
- Look, I don't want to pester you, Sarah, or become some, some nuisance that you can't avoid.
- I've seen Morgan go down that road far too many times to count.
- And since I've already given the fancy eloquent version of this speech before, right now I'm just gonna be blunt and honest.
- I love you.
- One more time just because it feels really nice to say: I love you.
- I feel like I've been bottling this up forever. I love you.
- Chuck, you don't have...
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm getting out of hand, but...
- Look, you were right in Prague.
- You and I-- we're perfect for each other, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you away from everyone else and away from this spy life.
- Chuck, I've made a commitment, and not just to Shaw.
- Don't go.
- Don't do it. Leave with me instead.
- Today at 2:00, Union Station, we go to Mexico, and after that, anywhere that you want.
- I would, however, like to go and see the Eiffel Tower at some point if that's at all possible.
- Don't answer now.
- Don't say a word.
- I don't want to have to convince you.
- I just want you to show up.
- I'm gonna kiss you now... if that's okay.
- â? ª â? ª
- I'm gonna go home to pack both summer and winter wear.
- I love you, Sarah Walker.
- I always have.
- (heart monitor beeping)
- WOMAN (over P. A. ): Dr. Morris, dial 183, please.
- Dr. Morris.
- (phone rings)
- This is Shaw.
- (knocking)
- You got a sec?
- Uh, yeah, sure. Come on in.
- Uh, can I get you a drink or anything?
- No, no, I can't stay.
- I just wanted to come by and tell you something about Bartowski.
- Well, if you came to plead his case, then that's really not necessary.
- No, he didn't send me.
- He doesn't know I'm here.
- I just wanted to tell you something in case it changed anything.
- He didn't k\*ll the mole.
- What?
- I did.
- He didn't have the stones to pull the trigger.
- The kid's not a k\*ll.
- Just not wired that way.
- Unlike us.
- Just thought you should know.
- See you around.
- Casey...
- Yeah?
- Thank you.
- You have a nice life, Walker.
- â? ª â? ª
- (door bangs open)
- Hey, Washington will have to wait.
- We have a trace on the Director.
- I have the details in the car. Come on.
- Well, I need to call Chuck.
- There's no time. You can do it from the car.
- (phone rings)
- Chuck, we have an urgent situation.
- Our forensic team was able to recover this video from the wreckage of the Ring's bunker.
- The woman is Agent Eve Shaw, Daniel Shaw's deceased wife.
- Well, this is all very touching, General, but what does it have to do with Sarah?
- Keep watching.
- The data drive the Ring recovered from the mole's body, we now believe it contained footage of a red test conducted on the night of Agent Shaw's death.
- That's Sarah.
- Sarah k\*ll his wife.
- Did you know?
- I assure you I had no knowledge that Agent Walker was responsible for Eve Shaw's death.
- If Shaw has seen this... if the Ring played him this video...
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. General, where is Sarah now?
- We believe she's with Agent Shaw.
- Do you have any idea where Agent Shaw might have taken her?
- I still don't have a signal.
- Daniel, where are you taking us?
- To settle an old score.
