# Chuck Versus the Honeymooners

- Hi. I'm Chuck. Here's a few things that you might need to know.
- This is General Beckman of the NSA.
- I am calling to say... that you are officially a member of Operation Bartowski.
- I think we're gonna need a few more days in Paris.
- No. I want you back ASAP.
- Bon soir, Madame.
- Compartment service. So sorry to bother you...
- Right. I'll take it from here.
- Thank you.
- But wait. Uh, wouldn't you prefer for me to carve?
- I'm pretty good with knives.
- Ah.
- Will there be anything else?
- Actually. You know what?
- I think we have everything we need.
- Ah.
- Very good, monsieur.
- - Merci.
- Bon soir.
- Good afternoon yet again, monsieur.
- Merci.
- You do know, we have a full dining car at the rear of the train.
- Yes. Uh, we're just...
- We quite like it in here.
- Uh-uh. So...
- Hey.
- So you really don't have a favorite band?
- I don't... I can't...
- Everybody's got a favorite band.
- What's your favorite live show? We'll start there.
- Music has not been at the top of my list.
- Oh, is that right? Oh.
- Is that so?
- Well, okay, music.
- Something that we can work on.
- Although, that would require us leaving this compartment, and I'm not sure how I feel about that.
- No. I...
- Beckman expected us back in Burbank today.
- So did Ellie and Casey and Devon.
- We can't just run away like this.
- Why not?
- Chuck...
- Casey's been reinstated, Ellie and Awesome are going to Africa.
- Everyone else is moving forward with their life.
- Sarah, for the first time since I've known you, nothing is holding us back.
- And if Beckman finds out, she could stop all of this, us.
- I can't risk that. I won't.
- You're right.
- I can't go back to how it was before.
- Before this, before you.
- We should do what I should have done in Prague.
- We should run.
- But, Chuck, is that what you really want?
- I want you.
- Sarah Walker, do you agree to quit the spy life with me?
- I do.
- Chuck Bartowski, do you agree to quit the spy life with me?
- I do.
- Agents Walker and Bartowski haven't checked in since the Shaw incident.
- They were to report back here at 0800 today.
- As far as the US government is concerned, they're AWOL.
- Well, we'll need access to Interpol sat imaging.
- Our uplink's...
- We've been down that path, Colonel.
- I'm coming to you because you have access to...
- A unique resource.
- The Intersect and Mr. Grimes have an oddly codependent relationship.
- I need to know if they're in communication.
- Use him to find Chuck.
- Devon, what are these?
- Babe, this didn't happen by accident.
- Okay, well, they're not coming with us to Africa.
- Don't worry, babe.
- I'm sure Chuck will be at our going-away party.
- It's fine.
- It's fine. If he shows up, he shows up.
- If he doesn't...
- You know, I'm sure whatever he's doing at Buy More Corporate is very important.
- Well, I see you finally made it out of your compartment, Mr. and Mrs...
- Charles Carmi... Charles.
- Charles Charles is the name.
- We are the Charles.
- Charles-ezez.
- We... we're on our honeymoon.
- Huh.
- Mrs. Charles.
- Ah. Enchanté.
- Enjoy.
- Merci. Merci.
- I... I... I blew that cover story, didn't I?
- I think the honeymoon bit might have been too much.
- Was it? It probably was.
- I should have just said we were dating exclusively.
- I mean, that's a fair assumption, right?
- Chuck, we're running away together.
- Man, pastries for breakfast every morning.
- Europe is genius.
- Of course you're probably used to this stuff, right?
- Well, I may have a lot of stamps in my passport, but I think this is the first time that I'm actually seeing the place.
- Well, where do we begin?
- We can go anywhere, be anyone, do anything.
- Well, we could go skiing in the Alps.
- I don't know. Could be painful.
- Although, we could also catch a bunch of great concerts.
- That could be fun.
- And, uh, if we get tired of Europe, there is always...
- Canada.
- No matter where we go or what we do...
- As long as we're together, right?
- Raspberry and chocolate chips.
- Charge this to room 47B, please.
- To not being spies.
- Casey, I'm telling you, I haven't heard from Chuck, and he hasn't updated his Facebook status in over a week.
- Which I can only assume means, well, that he's prob...
- Probably something pretty important, right?
- Let's cut the man some slack.
- He's got the world's fate resting in his hands.
- Oh, I'd say he's got something else resting in his hands.
- What do you mean?
- Chuck's off-grid with Walker. Do the math, Grimes.
- He's going to need a walker when Walker's through with him.
- They're having intercourse, idiot.
- Oh. Oh. Got you. Say no more.
- Ah. Good for Chuck.
- Well, shouldn't be too hard to find then.
- And yes, I will assist you.
- I happen to be the Intersect of Chuck, so... Oh. Hey.
- You seen Chuck?
- I was just going to ask you the same thing So, where's Chuck?
- You are on a need-to-know basis.
- Dude.
- Well, good thing you came to me, as I have been tasked to bring him back, so...
- Back? Back? Back from where?
- Well, probably better you don't know.
- Whatever. But you know the going-away party I'm having for me and Ellie tomorrow night?
- Yes, sure.
- No matter what she says, it will k\*ll her if Chuck's not there to say good-bye, so make it happen.
- Somebody say Bat Mitzvah?
- Hey.
- No. Party.
- You know, there's a lengthy Hebrew translation I'm not gonna get into, but in the olden days, Bat Mitzvah meant, "party hard"
- "'cause your daughter's almost ripe for plucking. "
- Oh.
- Oh, my.
- I miss the olden days.
- I'm gonna assume our invitations got lost in the mail. Jeffster!... formally accepts.
- Ha!
- Our manager, by which I mean me, will be in touch.
- I can't believe it.
- We're really out of the spy game.
- Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be tough to just turn off this old head of mine.
- I know what you mean.
- It's kind of second nature.
- So, theoretically, if I were to flash, I'd just ignore it.
- That's what we decided, right?
- Right.
- Right, just a couple of regular people blending in.
- Just a couple of regular people doing regular things.
- Nothing heroic.
- Exactly.
- 'Cause that's what you wanted, right?
- Of course.
- Maybe I'll just get some fresh air.
- You know, I could use some ice cream.
- You want to go get it?
- No, you can get it. You can get it.
- I'll get fresh air right here.
- Good. You know, I'll just open the window, you know.
- There's nothing like some nice Swiss air to get the bl\*od pumping.
- You know what I mean? Oh! Oh!
- Oh, that's cold.
- That is brisk, but refreshing.
- Ah, I'll be right back.
- Juan Arnaldo.
- He's a Basque t\*rror1st.
- What on earth are they planning?
- Oh, damn it.
- Names, dates.
- What are they up to?
- What are y'all doing in my room?
- My husband is going to kick your behinds!
- This is my compartment.
- Though I'd be happy to show you to wherever you are going.
- Oh!
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Perdon, lo siento!
- All these rooms look the same six drinks in.
- We do everything big in Texas.
- I can see that.
- Right.
- Well, I'll be on my way.
- Perdon.
- Was just doing some calisthenics.
- You know? I can't let myself go now that I got the girl.
- Right.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
- You know, Chuck, I can't fake this.
- Not with you.
- What?
- You've been faking it the whole time?
- No, no, no, not that.
- I spotted a Basque t\*rror1st on board.
- Juan... Diego Arnaldo!
- I know, I flashed on him.
- He has a whole list of names in his room.
- Yeah, all of his contacts from the Euskadi Ta Askatasuna.
- Oh, my God, you even make t\*rror1st groups sound sexy.
- So, you were the one I was hiding from.
- You were the one in the bathroom?
- You know, Juan Diego Arnaldo is a t\*rror1st.
- After all, it would be irresponsible...
- Even criminal to turn our backs on this.
- One last mission before we quit?
- One last mission.
- Let me get this straight. Last time you saw Chuck was in Paris?
- Quiet.
- Well, hey, you asked me for my help.
- No, I was tasked to ask for your help.
- There's a big difference.
- Tomato John. Listen to me.
- You're looking for a needle in a haystack made of needles.
- You need to create an advantage.
- That's me.
- You know, it can take up to seven minutes to strangle someone to death.
- I've done it in under 30 seconds.
- Wow.
- See, I thought John Casey wasn't scared of anything.
- I'm not.
- Then why are you so scared to ask for my help?
- Huh?
- Go.
- All right, looks like we have an Oracle based system here.
- Okay. It's just I've been studying this particular subject for over 20 years.
- I think I know a thing or two.
- Mm-hmm.
- I noticed that Chuck left behind his eczema moisturizing cream, which he needs a prescription for.
- Dr. Feldman, our dermatologist, would've had to call into a pharmacy.
- Montparnasse.
- Near the train station.
- Ah, let me see if I can find out what day he picked it up.
- Okay, April 15, so let's cross-check that with the train station security camera footage.
- This is going to be tough.
- Yeah, see? This is why we leave the spy work to the spies.
- Uh-uh-uh- not yet, not yet. Listen to me.
- Chuck's a hard-core DC Comic's guy.
- And Sarah, I know, Sarah... My boy's not leaving Paris without the latest issue of Justice League.
- What?
- Now, where's the nearest magazine stand?
- There. There.
- Bingo.
- Huh, there he is. There's our boy.
- Just see if we can zoom in on the ticket.
- Gotcha.
- They're en route to Zurich.
- Make sure your passport's up to date.
- Pack light.
- Wait a minute.
- I'm traveling to Europe on the government's dime?
- Champagne, langostino, fully reclining seats...
- First class, here I come, baby.
- Casey, I get nervous feelings when I fly.
- Yeah, I know. Big job ahead of us.
- Get some sleep.
- Can't.
- You see, in my head, the only way the plane remains aloft is if I'm rooting for it.
- So, stands to reason if I'm sleeping, I'm not rooting.
- Whatever, nut job.
- But you wake me, you'll be the only one that dies.
- If we can subdue Arnaldo and his men, and leave them cuffed at the next station...
- We can place an anonymous call to Interpol to pick them up.
- Bad guys delivered.
- Day saved.
- Then we can finally start living our real lives together.
- Right?
- Right.
- So, what's the plan?
- We left all of our spy gear in Paris.
- Oh, hey. Sorry, man.
- Ride on the train's a little bumpy.
- You know, I've even had a couple drinks.
- Take it easy.
- Oui?
- Yeah? Oui?
- Trés bien.
- Vive la France.
- Au revoir.
- Well, they already know me as a drunken newlywed.
- It's about time they met my handsome husband. What do you say, tiger?
- Well, I do believe, you are correct, Mrs. Charles.
- Although, I can't help feeling like we're missing something.
- Is all that really necessary?
- Every world traveler knows that he should own a sturdy rucksack.
- Oh, what's with the stupid maple leaf patch?
- Every American also knows to act Canadian as to be well-liked.
- That's a cliché.
- We're on a mission, not a vacation.
- Well, I'm sorry. I've never been to Europe.
- I've barely been south of Redondo Beach.
- Bonjour.
- Ticket, please.
- Oh, right. Sorry.
- What are you doing?
- Hold on.
- Don't worry. My ticket is in my super secret money pouch.
- There you go.
- Hey, trains and buses are hotbeds for gypsy activities. Staying alert.
- Thank you.
- You check the sleeping compartments, I got the dining car.
- Move.
- Copy that.
- Whoa. Casey?
- Up you go.
- Okay.
- Gracias, senor.
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, y'all. It's me.
- Remember me? I was in y'alls room.
- Oh, I don't suppose you would mind taking a picture of me and my husband? It's our honeymoon.
- Yes, it is.
- Oh!
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, my God.
- I am so sorry.
- Charlie, baby, look what I did.
- I made an oopsie.
- It's no problem, my dear.
- Like you say, you only honeymoon once.
- This man speaks the truth.
- Hey, but still, apologies nonetheless.
- Mr. Charles and Mrs. Charles.
- We are the Charleses.
- The Charlesezez.
- Well, either way, Charlie Charles does not spill a man's drink onto a man's cheese tray and not buy a man another drink.
- So why don't I just go ahead and get you some freshies and maybe another cheese tray to boot?
- Oh, isn't he just a sweetheart?
- I mean, isn't that...
- Attention Mr. and Mrs. Whatever-your-last-name-is.
- Why do they need a rehearsal?
- Prepare yourself to be wowed by a Wall of Sound.
- Sound, sound.
- What was that?
- Damn it, Jeffrey, you blew the amp.
- Don't you know that it's not the size of the instrument that matters, but how much and how long and how often your mother catches you playing?
- You know who can fix that amp in two seconds? Chuck.
- Guys, I really think you can handle it.
- No, we definitely need Chuck.
- We don't need Chuck! Okay?
- Sorry.
- We're just...
- We're going to figure something out.
- Go get our turtlenecks.
- Tonight...
- Jeffster! goes unplugged.
- Um, Lester, that's lime juice.
- Vive la France.
- Here we are.
- Sorry about the inconvenience.
- Here's your three fresh beverages for you, gentlemen.
- Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to steal my pretty, little wife back from you, 'cause it's been a speck of time since I whispered sweet nothings in my gal's ear.
- Come on, now. She is a tigress.
- A tigress! She just comes at you.
- Come on, baby. Let's go have some fun.
- Bye.
- Y'all have a good trip, now.
- Okay.
- Well, cheers!
- You know, uh, I know this is our last mission, but we make a great team, Mrs. Charles.
- I'm thinking the same thing, Mr. Charles.
- Oh, God.
- Casey?
- What are you doing here?
- Putting to rest any stupid ideas you two might have of turning this into a permanent vacation.
- I realize how this must look right now, but what you are unaware of is we're on a mission, okay?
- Behind you at the end of the dining car are members of the Basque ETA.
- Those drunk guys?
- Yeah, they... they look real threatening.
- Casey, what are you doing?
- You don't understand. He's getting away!
- What kind of a chump do you take me for anyway?
- Sorry.
- Come on.
- Coming. Coming.
- Not so fast. Wrist. Wrist.
- Right. Okay, go, go, go, go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Excuse me.
- Excuse me. Are you Canadian?
- Me, too, eh.
- Oh, man.
- Sorry to bother you.
- Have you seen my friend? He's about... He's aboot...
- Stay away from me, or I'll cut you.
- Not such a passive people after all, huh?
- I'll go first.
- Oh, you know, maybe I should...
- S... Sarah! I'm stuck!
- Sarah? Sarah? Are you okay?
- Hold on, Chuck. I've got it.
- Uh, I just got locked out. That's all.
- Hi. Hi there. Hi.
- Lovely scarf.
- Whoa!
- Chuck, get off me.
- t\*rror1st, huh?
- I would have thought two spies could come up with a better excuse than that.
- Casey, he's... he's here, okay?
- He's in the bathroom, I swear to you.
- Hi.
- All right, let's say I believe you now.
- Would you explain to me what the hell is going on?
- Hey! Hey!
- Go. Go!
- Run! Run! Get out of the way!
- Oh!
- That was awesome!
- Did you see that hit? Guys!
- Oh. Oh.
- If you're going to k\*ll me, just do it.
- We're not going to k\*ll you.
- Yeah, we're CIA, dirtbag.
- Morgan, probably not the best idea to share that information with just anyone.
- If you're CIA, then why did you take out the Interpol agents on the train?
- Wait. What? Excuse me?
- Those weren't your men?
- Interpol already apprehended you?
- No, Interpol was taking me to a witness protection program in exchange for the names of several key ETA leaders.
- You turned yourself in?
- I have been living on the run for the last two years of my life.
- I couldn't take it anymore.
- You didn't run this mission through Beckman?
- We wanted to do it, um, under the radar.
- Why?
- Because they're quitting.
- What? !
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
- Hold on a second, Chuck. You can't just stop.
- Dude, you are a spy.
- This is who you are, man.
- You're in the middle of a mission.
- Morgan, Sarah and I...
- We decided we want to be together.
- So, this is it for us, okay?
- Soon as we hand over Arnaldo, we're quitting.
- Hey, give me the cuffs.
- It's Elia.
- The Interpol agents are neutralized.
- Someone did our job for us.
- Meet me in Pundtun.
- We'll make sure Arnaldo and his new friends never talk.
- Chuck, what were you thinking?
- You apprehended Juan Diego Arnaldo without contacting me first?
- Well, yes, technically...
- Your part in this little impromptu mission is over.
- I'll arrange for Arnaldo to be picked up by a different Interpol team.
- Try not to physically as\*ault them.
- General, just so you know, we didn't hit them or as\*ault them in any way.
- There was no physical altercation.
- We just dosed them with pharmaceutical-grade narcotics.
- Agent Bartowski...
- No, you're right. That's not making it better.
- How's she taking it?
- Really good I think. Yeah.
- All you need to do is keep Arnaldo alive until the local team arrives.
- Think you can handle that?
- Absolutely, General.
- Once Arnaldo is placed safely in Interpol custody, you are to return to Burbank immediately.
- And you better have a good explanation for...
- Agent Bartowski?
- General, General, please know I'm not hanging up on you right now, it's...
- Well?
- Well, we get to hang around here for a little bit longer, so... vaca.
- It's like the butter sh\*t directly from a Swiss cow into my mouth.
- And yet... still can't enjoy it.
- I can't believe you're just quitting.
- Walking away from everything.
- I'm not.
- I'm walking toward something.
- I can't believe you were just going to leave without saying good-bye to Ellie, though.
- Ellie is going away to do something that she wants to do and I'm happy for her and Devon.
- So that's it?
- You're throwing away your life for Bartowski?
- I'm making a life.
- You know I've been tasked to retrieve you.
- Yeah, I know why you're here, Casey, and we're not going back.
- But you're a spy, man.
- I mean, this is the coolest thing that's ever happened to us.
- I know what it means to make a choice like this.
- I won't stop you.
- Thank you.
- Unless you want me to.
- I thought this was everything that you ever wanted.
- It is.
- Okay? It is.
- But I want Sarah more.
- Look, no matter how much I want to be a spy, I want Chuck more.
- May I interject?
- No.
- No.
- So I... If I have to choose between the two,
- I... I choose Sarah.
- Does it have to be a choice?
- I don't know.
- Excuse me.
- Look, Sarah has been a spy her entire life.
- And now she's willing to give up everything that she has ever known to be with me, man. Me.
- Doesn't have to be all or nothing.
- No, I can't risk it.
- This is what he wants.
- And if this is what she wants... then I'm not gonna risk losing her again.
- Okay. Fine.
- Just do me this favor.
- Before you quit, make damn sure that quitting is what she wants.
- All right, enough of this.
- Well, if you two are gonna go, you better go now before the other Interpol team gets here.
- Right now?
- Now.
- We'll hand over Arnaldo.
- We'll handle it.
- Well, I will.
- Perhaps we should all share some nut cake before you go.
- Especially you two.
- Open communication is very important...
- Shut up.
- All right.
- Say good-bye, huh?
- Love you, buddy.
- I love you, too. I'll miss you.
- Thank you, Casey.
- Hey. Take care of my boy.
- I will.
- All right.
- Move.
- ♪ So kiss me and smile for me ♪
♪ Tell me that you'll wait for me ♪
♪ Hold me like you'll never let me go ♪
♪ 'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane ♪
- Well, here we go.

- I got to say, it's really weird leaving.
- I mean, I've never lived anywhere outside of California before, so...

- ♪ Oh, babe, I hate to go ♪
♪ I hate to go. ♪
- Good job. All right!
- Thank you.
- Devon, Ellie, you want to come up here and say a few words?
- Oh.
- Colonel John Casey.
- Agent Simon.
- Agent Patine.
- We heard there was a misunderstanding on the train.
- Yeah, you could say that.
- Hello. I'm right here.
- So impolite. M. Grimes.
- Can't disclose what the M stands for security. You understand.
- So, yeah, yeah. Where you boys stationed nowadays?
- Lake Como.
- Is that right? Seriously?
- Lake Como? Oh, I love Lake Como.
- I've never actually been there myself, but I took an entire plane ride and read all about it.
- Check it out, right here.
- Yeah, paints quite the elegant portrait, you know?
- But it is still just a book, so...
- Tell me... The Villa del Balbianello...
- I mean, am I saying that right? Bell... bell... bellelo?
- It's beautiful.
- Ah, I can imagine.
- This time of year, I would...
- Grimes!
- Let them do their job.
- Naturally. Sure, sure.
- There I go.
- But one more question about Lake Como.
- Sagra di San Giovanni...
- Is it just everything I heard it was?
- I mean, I... I...
- Look, like I said, the palaces are beautiful there.
- Yeah.
- Palaces?
- We really should go.
- Yeah, no.
- I've held you up enough.
- I'll just go on all day "Lake Como, Lake Como".
- But one thing. Sagra di San Giovanni, well, it's this annual festival of boats.
- Supposed to be amazing.
- Dating back hundreds, if not thousands of years. So I don't know, I just thought anyone who spent any amount of time in Lake Como, well, they'd probably know it.
- I don't recommend that.
- Oh, Canada.
- Wouldn't want to make a scene.
- Or a mess.
- Well, after you, Agent Walker.
- No longer an agent, right?
- No longer Mr. Charles either, I suppose.
- Sarah, this is what you want, right? To run away?
- Well, I always thought it had to be one way or the other, but maybe...
- Maybe... maybe what?
- You can say it. It's okay.
- Sorry to cut the honeymoon short.
- But what the hell have you done with Juan Diego Arnaldo?
- Guys, guys, guys, please listen to me.
- This is a giant misunderstanding.
- We're on the same side.
- Enough. You drugged us.
- Interpol did send an additional team to retrieve Arnaldo.
- Oh, okay, well, then I expect an apology.
- They were just found dead ten minutes outside of Pundtun.
- Oh, my God, Morgan and Casey.
- Guys, our friends are in really big trouble right now.
- Well, our friends are dead.
- And you're going to tell us why.
- Call it in.
- Sarah, we can't just leave them.
- I know, but if we're going to do something, we have to do it right now.
- Quiet.
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for the cuff keys.
- No, we don't have time.
- We have to run.
- Hold on.
- I want to know everything you've told Interpol.
- You should never have abandoned your team.
- Don't you have some sort of signal you can send to the CIA to alert them that we're in danger?
- The only CIA agents within 100 miles of here just quit.
- Just stay calm.
- I can't hit a girl.
- I can.
- On your feet. Hook arms. Push, push, push.
- That was awesome.
- Casey, you all right?
- Don't worry, I'll take care of this one.
- Don't you two have a train to catch?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, we do, right, Chuck?
- Right.
- May I just say... I've been on the run for two years, and no matter how far you run, you can never run from yourself.
- And from what I've heard from both of you, it's not what either of you really wants.
- You don't want to quit?
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- I don't want you to choose me over sometng that you want for yourself.
- I want you. I want us.
- Do you think if we went back, and we told Beckman the honest-to-god absolute truth, do you think we'd really have a sh\*t at having it all?
- Chuck Bartowski, do you agree to not quit the spy life and be with me?
- I do.
- Sarah Walker, do you agree to not quit the spy life and be with me?
- I do.
- Good work, Colonel Casey.
- Because of your efforts, a group of Basque t\*rrorists were captured.
- Thank you, General.
- It wasn't just me.
- Grimes here was resourceful and quick to action when necessary.
- An unlikely pair often produces successful results.
- Thank you. You're both dismissed.
- Actually, if I may address you directly, General.
- Wow, what a trip.
- And Chuck and Sarah, I know, I know, they may have acted impulsively, recklessly, foolishly even, I don't know, but I do know this... These two were born to be spies... together.
- Get him out of here.
- Ma'am.
- What?
- Do either of you have any type of explanation for your extemporaneous holiday?
- It was my fault.
- It was my fault.
- I flashed and made Agent Walker accompany me while pursuing a suspect.
- I was following a hunch and Chuck was simply being a good partner.
- Do you both think me an idiot?
- No, ma'am.
- No, ma'am.
- Then don't lie to me.
- General, look, I think it's important you should know that Sarah and I, we, we are...
- Stop right there. Release Agent Walker.
- I didn't ask. I don't need to know all the de...
- But I thought you said no more lies, and... and we... we want to tell you the truth.
- No.
- General, Chuck and I are dating.

- I must caution you that allowing your private life to interfere with your professional one can be dangerous.
- But off the record, it's about damn time.
- Oh, my God, I forgot that Ellie was leaving.
- Ellie, Devon?
- I've never asked Chuck for anything.
- I just wanted the chance to say good-bye.
- And he couldn't even give me that.
- I just wanted the chance to say good-bye.
- And he couldn't... Chuck.
- Ellie.
- I forgot my phone.
- I think I still might be a little drunk.
- I'm so sorry, Ellie.
- I wanted to be here.
- Chuck, it's fine.
- You missed one party.
- Truth is, I think I got so drunk because I was upset with myself.
- I'm leaving my little brother.
- I'm not so little anymore.
- And, uh, just so you know, you're not leaving me alone.
- You guys are back together?
- We're together.
- I think I found the one.
- This is going to be your favorite song.
- I like this.
- That's a good start.
