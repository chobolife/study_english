# Chuck Versus the Beard

- Here's a couple of things that you might need to know or maybe you just forgot.
- Hannah, there are things in my life that you can't understand.
- So I have to end this.
- Chuck, I think we need to talk.
- Not a good time.
- Are you suggesting Chuck is caught in a big,  giant web of conspiracy and deception?
- I'm gonna have to lie to your sister, and I can't do that anymore.
- From now on, if Ellie asks you something, just say "I don't know".
- You two got it bad for this blond.
- It's about keeping his emotions in check so that the Intersect can work.
- Flash.
- Come on.
- You know what, Casey? You're right.
- I don't work. My emotions just mess everything up.
- Hey, guys, I got your call.
- What's, uh...
- What's going on?
- You're the Intersect. You tell us.
- We've intercepted Intel that the Ring is planning to turn and use a CIA agent against us.
- The problem is, we don't know who, when or where.
- Did you flash?
- Uh, yeah. Not, uh, not flashing.
- You haven't flashed in a week, Chuck.
- Ever since Rafe tried to k\*ll Sarah and me.
- That's a problem.
- Problem?
- Really? Problem? Kind of a strong word, don't you think? Just 'cause a guy had a couple off nights.
- Off nights get agents k\*ll. You need to figure this out, because the Intersect's not working.
- And I can't risk putting you out in the field.
- Okay, so, what exactly are you saying?
- I'm saying that until you start flashing again, you're no longer a spy.
- No. No.
- No, you can't... you can't do that.
- Being a spy is all that I have.
- I gave up everything for this.
- Well, maybe some time off will do you good, Chuck.
- It'll help you function again.
- I don't need... I don't need time off, okay?
- Maybe I'm not flashing because I have all these emotions bottled up in me.
- You ever thought about that?
- I mean, I just broke up with Hannah, I can't talk to my best friend or my sister about anything in my life.
- I'm not a machine.
- Okay, I am a machine, but I'm also a person.
- Well, you can always talk to us.
- Yeah, uh, no thanks.
- I don't think that's going to work for me.
- Find something that does work.
- Because until you do, you're benched.
- Mmm, this getaway was the perfect idea, honey.
- It's just what we needed.
- You said it, babe.
- I can't tell you how awesome it feels to be alone, just the two of us.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
- I'll be just a sec.
- Hey, Chuck.
- Awesome, hey. Thank God you picked up.
- Everything okay, Chuck?
- No, no, not really.
- I broke up with Hannah, and... and Sarah's falling for another guy.
- Not only is my personal life a mess, but my spy life, too...
- Chuck, I went on vacation to get away from your spy life.
- Okay? And to fix things with Ellie.
- No, no. Devon, Devon, Devon.
- Devon, Devon, I don't have anyone else to talk to.
- I'm sorry, bro.
- But remember what you said about discussing your spy life: I don't know.
- I say he can get it in there, but I agree with you, it seems impossible.
- So, put your wagers in.
- Put your wage... You are going to win this, children!
- What do you got in your pockets?
- Charles Irving Bartowski, please report to the assistant manager's office for disciplinary action.
- Right? Ah.
- Oh!
- Oh, my!
- This is a shocker!
- He got it in.
- I'm saying, do not wager against the brown beauty and the snake.
- He can unhinge his jaw and he sheds skin.
- Have a seat, please.
- You need anything? You okay?
- Uh, no, I'm-I'm... I'm good.
- I mean, you know, maybe a little more leg room would be nice.
- This conversation is never an easy one to have with an employee, Chuck.
- And what conversation would that be, exactly?
- We've known each other most of our lives.
- Hmm.
- We, uh, we went through puberty together.
- We went through the awkward stage after puberty, the awkward high school years, your awkward college years, and now, our current awkward Buy More years.
- Which is why this moment for me is so very...
- Awkward?
- Yeah.
- Morgan, what exactly is going on?
- Something is. Something is going on in your life. You dumped Hannah.
- She quit the Buy More.
- She was a valued member of the store.
- And I just feel that a true best friend would share that with his true best friend.
- You really want to know the truth?
- I do.
- Lay it on me like a slice of cheese on a tuna melt.
- I am ready.
- Okay, here goes.
- I...
- Okay. Got it.
- You don't have to say any more.
- Say wha... ?
- I didn't say anything. Mor... Do you need help?
- I'm fine. No.
- I cannot believe I'm saying this, but... you're fired.
- Wha... what?
- You're firing me from the Buy More?
- Buy More? No, are you kidding me?
- You're the best Nerd Herder we have.
- I need you here.
- I'm firing you as my best friend.
- Hey! You guys, uh...
- You guys leaving on the mission?
- You sure you don't want me to join?
- We'd love you to, Chuck, but the Intersect is not working.
- The agent that the Ring plans to turn is staying at this hotel.
- We have no record of any spy being there, so whoever it is is deep undercover.
- Yeah, I'm-I'm... I'm sorry.
- I'm still not flashing.
- We've got to go.
- Guys, the team's a man short without me.
- Not today. I'm taking your place on this mission.
- The Ring knows that you're still alive, Shaw.
- It's too dangerous for you to be in the field.
- And I can't leave this team shorthanded.
- Besides, if the Ring wants a fight, I'll give them a fight.
- Now... when we get back I expect this place to be exactly as I left it.
- You two newly weds ready?
- Yeah, let's go.
- What's with the... the... rings?
- What... ?
- Hey, Casey. What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
- Don't you have a day job?
- Hey, what's going on, guys?
- Shh!
- Charles, please!
- It's a spy mission. You are not qualified. Get away.
- I...
- 49...
- 57, 43.
- 40.
- El g\*n School of Finance, we take care of business!
- What's going on here, Big Mike?
- Someone's thinking of buying the store.
- We're closing today so some building inspectors and technicians can come down and kick the tires.
- Sweet. We get the day off. Jeffrey, let's get pershnickered.
- No.
- They want to interview everyone.
- Reevaluate the entire staff.
- Gonna fire everyone who's not essential.
- So, I can get started over here.
- We're in big trouble, boys.
- Here are your keys.
- Enjoy your stay here at the Malibu Vista Hotel.
- Might I add that the two of you are a very beautiful couple.
- Oh. Thank you.
- You two lovebirds have fun while I'm cooped up in the van again.
- Have a margarita for me.
- There's a Ring agent somewhere in this hotel.
- We need to find him.
- I tapped into the phone's mainframe.
- If the Ring calls out again, we can trace it back to the room it originated from.
- Sarah and I have set up the surveillance equipment.
- We'll begin searching for possible targets.
- Listen up, team.
- These suits are sharks.
- They'll try to divide us in our interviews, find our weaknesses, look for any excuse they can to fire our asses.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Listen, despite our differences, all we have is each other.
- So let's, uh, let's stick together here, all right?
- This is a bl\*od oath right here.
- One for all, and all for one. All right.
- Lester Patel?
- Yeah, I've found it!
- Found it! Contact lens.
- All crisis averted.
- I love you guys.
- Come on down.
- All right.
- Oh, my God. We're doomed.
- Have a seat, yeah.
- Okay, so...
- Before I spill this place's dirty secrets, I want to know that I'm protected.
- I want diplomatic immunity.
- I... I don't think it's appropriate in this situation.
- Bah, bah, bah, bah bah, bah, bah. You want the dirt?
- I want immunity.
- Okay.
- Immunity granted.
- Okay.
- Thank you, my brother.
- Well...
- It's an interesting group of employees you put together here.
- Oh, they scare me, too.
- But I got Bartowski, don't I?
- Mm-hmm.
- That's right.
- A man with a Stanford degree is working here.
- You see, gentlemen, I'm not just a manager; I'm a people person.
- Talent follows me.
- Morgan Grimes, assistant manager, how are you, sir?
- Morgan, hey, buddy, I need to talk to you.
- Clearly you don't, Chuck, or I wouldn't have fired you as my best friend.
- Can I please just have a minute?
- Not now, Chuck, all right?
- I'm freaking out about this interview, man.
- Look. Hey, buddy?
- You're going to be fine.
- Besides, it's only the Buy More. You can always get another job.
- It's not the end of the world.
- Really?
- See, it may not be the end of the world to you, but I don't have a Stanford degree, Chuck.
- I can't do anything else but the Buy More.
- This job is all I have.
- I...
- Chuck Bartowski? You're up.
- That's an impressive resumé.
- So what's a Stanford grad doing working at a Buy More?
- Uh, you know, let's just say the-the Buy More offers more opportunities than initially meets the eye.
- Really?
- For instance?
- For instance, I get to work with my best friend every day.
- Your best friend?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Morgan Grimes.
- The, uh, the assistant manager.
- Based on your track record, you're the cream of this Buy More crop.
- Why aren't you the assistant manager?
- Because the right guy has already got the job.
- I... I know that you guys are maybe gonna be making some changes around here, so I just want you to know that while I might look good on paper, I'm not the cream of the crop.
- Morgan Grimes is.
- Okay, the Ring just made a call from the hotel.
- I'll connect you in while I trace it back.
- The target is by the pool.
- Six foot two, well built.
- He's wearing a blue and white bathing suit.
- You got that, Walker?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Did you find the target?
- Yeah, we found him.
- Cheers.
- Oh, it's so nice.
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.
- Yeah, good egg.
- Yeah.
- Really good egg, yeah.
- Really good egg.
- Well, ha... have a good day.
- Hey, you too.
- Take care.
- Get the others in here.
- So, you really think this Bartowski guy is Agent Carmichael?
- Oh, it's Carmichael, all right.
- Looks like Shaw left him behind to man the fort.
- Should we abort the mission?
- No, with Shaw not here, it's our best chance to infiltrate and recover everything he has on us.
- Have you found the entrance into Shaw's base yet?
- No.
- We don't have much time.
- We have to find it fast.
- Do you want us to take out Bartowski?
- Not yet.
- Let's keep interviewing employees and make sure Shaw didn't leave any other surprises behind.
- Chuck said Grimes is his best friend.
- We can use both of them to our advantage.
- What do you want me to do about the others?
- I think we need to be conservative here.
- Getting away is the best thing we could've done, babe.
- I know I haven't been the same guy lately, but since we got here, I gotta tell you, I feel awesome again.
- Me, too.
- To us.
- No stress, no work, no problemas.
- The call came from Room 4305.
- I'll head there now and search it.
- We'll go down to the pool, get Devon and Ellie out of harm's way.
- Come on, flash!
- Hmm.
- Uh... no.
- Oh, I know, I know this.
- I know this.
- Uh, uh, The Condor? Uh, The Jackal?
- Chan Min Chi.
- Damn it, I thought I had that one.
- This better be good.
- Hey, yeah, hey, just, just checking in on the mission.
- Seeing if you guys needed anything.
- Why, are you flashing now?
- No, I'm not. But I thought, you know, maybe if you throw me the rock, I'll pop on something.
- I don't have time for this, Bartowski.
- Only as good as your last flash, huh?
- Mmm, two more piña coladas coming right up.
- Looks good.
- How's the water?
- What are you two doing here?
- You're not supposed to be here.
- I just reclaimed my awesomeness.
- We got a tip that the Ring was trying to turn an agent staying at this hotel.
- You.
- Me?
- But I'm not an agent.
- Chuck told me that I was in the clear.
- Are Ellie and I in danger?
- I don't know.
- I can't believe they're selling the Buy More.
- Oh, man, I think they're really serious about buying this place.
- 'Cause they have been going through it with a fine tooth comb.
- Even checking lockers.
- It was really great talking to you.
- Jeffrey Barnes?
- You gotta help me, Morgan.
- I got contraband in my locker.
- What kind of contraband?
- Just a little something I use to take the edge off on a stressful day. If they find it, Ill be fired for sure.
- Mr. Barnes...
- Morgan, please.
- Okay.
- Okay, all right, dude.
- I'm at the Ring agent's room.
- I'm going in.
- Be careful.
- I'm always careful.
- The target is by the pool.
- Six foot two, well built.
- He's wearing a blue and white bathing suit.
- Our operatives are in position.
- Ugh, it's a set-up.
- I gotta get Ellie out of here.
- I got to get both of us out of here right now.
- Keep it together, Devon.
- We'll figure this out.
- What? What was that?
- I'm so sorry, false alarm.
- Wait, you crashed my weekend getaway to tell me I'm in danger and now you tell me what, we're safe?
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- Please try and enjoy the rest of your vacation.
- We gotta get away from this.
- Oh, my God.
- Let's see if we can find anything in the break room.
- Found something.
- There's a tunnel behind these lockers.
- Fingerprint scanner.
- This must be it. Go get Del and Neil.
- Tell them we found the CIA base.
- Good work.
- Tell the others we found Shaw's base.
- Oh, my God.
- This is not right, no!
- You understand me?
- Hey.
- What's going on?
- My spy work paid off, obviously.
- I mic'd Big Mike's office.
- All I got was a few seconds, but come in, listen.
- Chuck said Grimes is his best friend.
- We can use both of them to our advantage.
- What do you want me to do about the others?
- I think we need to be conservative here, terminate the rest.
- They're gonna fire the entire store, except you and Morgan.
- I just got this job back.
- Where is Morgan?
- Clever, putting a CIA base under an electronics store.
- Every piece of intelligence Shaw has on the Ring is in here. We'll be putting a dagger through the heart of the CIA's operation by taking it out. All right, Neil, you're on.
- Cut off any and all communications coming in and out of the store.
- Break into the mainframe, find and destroy everything they have on us.
- Then blow this base sky high.
- Be a pleasure.
- The phone works remotely.
- It was a set-up; they've lured us here.
- Why would they lure us here?
- It's not where they lured us to, it's where they lured us from.
- The Ring knows I'm alive, which means they know I'll have a base of operations somewhere.
- They sent us here so I'd abandon my base.
- That way they can go and recover all the intelligence we have on them.
- They weren't after Devon.
- They're after Castle.
- Chuck's in there, and he's not flashing.
- He's a sitting duck.
- Go!
- Hey, Morgan, we need to talk. Chuck, we gotta talk, listen.
- Me first okay, trust me, whatever you're gonna say is nothing compared to what I got.
- Hmm? Okay.
- Fine, yeah, please, sh\*\*t.
- Okay, uh...
- Dude, there's a secret underground CIA base under our Buy More.
- I... Hey, listen, I know it sounds crazy, but you have to believe me here, okay?
- These people who are claiming to buy the store, they're bad guys, okay?
- And they call themselves the Ring.
- Which I know is like, ooh, not that scary... but trust me, these guys are not to be messed with.
- How do you, how do you, how do you know all this, Morgan?
- Okay, I was hiding. I was hiding in there, and I saw them enter the base through an entrance behind our lockers.
- So, I followed them.
- I heard and saw everything.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, dude, listen, I know this is a lot for you to handle, but you gotta stay with me, you gotta pull together.
- 'Cause we are now in real danger here, okay?
- Buddy?
- Don't freak out.
- Chuck's not answering his cell.
- Buy More land line's down. I can't get through either.
- I think we should call the police.
- That's a great idea.
- That is a great idea, man.
- Wow, wow, yeah, yeah.
- What...
- Wha... Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- I don't, I don't, I don't have a signal.
- Right, right.
- Bad guys probably cut off all communication to the store.
- It makes sense. You know what?
- By the time the cops got here it'd be too late, anyway.
- We need to handle this now.
- No, no, no, no, Morgan.
- We don't need to do anything, except get everyone out of the store.
- Charles Irving Bartowski, listen to yourself!
- These men are trying to blow up a CIA base under our store.
- Okay, we are Buy More's...
- America's last line of defense.
- And we are going to take the fight to them.
- Morgan, listen to yourself right now.
- This is not a video game.
- This is real life.
- People get hurt.
- There is no restart from last checkpoint.
- I understand that you're scared, okay?
- And that not everybody has the stomach to be a hero.
- So I'll just go see if Jeff and Lester want to help, and, well...
- Okay, look, fine, fine, fine.
- I will help you on one condition.
- We get everyone else out of the store first, and what you've told me remains a secret between the two of us.
- Yes, yes.
- You know what?
- No need to put everyone else at risk.
- We will handle this, okay?
- And this secret is locked down.
- What's going on?
- We're locking down the store, Charles.
- We're refusing to leave until they give us our jobs back.
- No, GU... guys, that is a very...
- Please, don't... don't do that.
- Don't put that there. Don't, do... Stop! Stop!
- Stop putting things down.
- Look, locking down the store is a very, very, very bad idea.
- You two want to turn tail and run, fine.
- I'm staying here and fighting for my job.
- Mike, gentlemen, assorted ladies, taking over the Buy More is not only illegal, but it's very dangerous, trust me.
- The only thing dangerous is if they try to fire us.
- They're going to have to do it over dead bodies.
- These corporate fat cats think they can take whatever they want.
- They can take our dignity, they can take all the hot women, but they will not take our jobs!
- And they will never take our store!
- Buy More!
- Sarah, Shaw, Casey, can you hear me?
- You have to... your frequency.
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, I can hear you. What's going on?
- Oh, thank God. Thank God.
- Listen, listen, listen.
- The Ring is inside Castle, guys.
- They came in posing as buyers trying to purchase the store.
- We're on our way back. Sit tight.
- This is for you. Mace. I know it's not much, but it'll have to do.
- Emmett kept a stockpile in case the Russians attacked Red Dawn style.
- This is for you also. Walkie-talkie. Don't drop it. It's expensive.
- You ready to do this? Let's do this.
- No, no, no, no, no, Morgan.
- Listen, on second thought, I-I... I don't think we should do this.
- No, maybe you're right. Let's get out of here.
- Right? Maybe get a little burger or something...
- Are you kidding me, Chuck? !
- Men are trying to blow up a CIA base here, okay?
- Time is running out.
- Time to step up.
- No, no.
- Morgan, you don't want to do this, okay?
- Trust me, you don't understand.
- You don't understand, Chuck. I've been a loser my whole entire life and I'm done with that, okay? Time for me to be a hero.
- But-but what is a hero, really, you know?
- You're all alone, Agent Carmichael.
- I've locked down the base.
- Sir, who's Agent Carmichael?
- Okay? You're crazy.
- This guy is crazy, Chuck. Thinks you're a spy.
- Yeah, yeah, th... that's ridiculous, thinking I'm a spy.
- Ridiculous, sir.
- Okay, listen to me, we work at the Buy More, all right?
- And if you just... if you let us go, I promise we're not going to tell anyone what you're doing here.
- Tell him, Chuck.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, n... not a word.
- Zipping it. Locking it down.
- Locked, it's already locked down.
- That is a really sharp looking razor.
- We've searched the base's main frame.
- Shaw's files aren't there.
- We know that he's hiding them here.
- Tell us where they are, Agent Carmichael.
- Trust me... The alternative is extremely unpleasant.
- You know, I don't think there's any need for torture right now, because even if I was a spy, which I'm not...
- I'm not saying that I am a spy... but even if I was a spy, my training would have taught me to withstand said torture.
- So I don't really think it's going to have any kind of effect at this particular juncture, right?
- That's why I'm going to torture him.
- You made the mistake of telling us the bearded fella's your best friend.
- For the last time... where are the files, Agent Carmichael?
- Guys, guys, please, please, please just listen to me.
- This is ridiculous, okay?
- I have known this man my entire life, all right?
- Chuck Bartowski has been my best friend... my brother... since we were six.
- Chuck Bartowski is not a spy.
- Chuck?
- Chuck! Chuck!
- Chuck, please!
- Tell him something! Tell him the truth!
- Chuck!
- I'm really scared here!
- Chuck!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop!
- Chuck!
- Stop, stop.
- Morgan, the... the truth is...
- The truth is... I am a member of a joint NSA-CIA black ops team that is stationed here in Burbank.
- I have a level six clearance, and my code name is Charles Carmichael.
- I'm a spy, buddy.
- Sarah, anything?
- We're locked out. They overwrote our security access.
- I'm locked out here.
- Casey's checking the Buy More.
- Cease fire, cease fire.
- Hold your... hold your fire.
- Unlock the door.
- What the hell is going on in here?
- The store's being bought.
- They're canning everybody except Bartowski and Grimes.
- We're staging a revolution to take down the Man.
- I want in.
- How do we know that we can trust you, son?
- That you're not some kind of spy for the Man?
- Because the only thing I hate more than hippie Neo-liberal fascists and anarchists... are the hypocrite fat-cat suits they eventually grow up to become.
- Yep, that works for me. Good-good... good point.
- Nice to chat.
- Welcome aboard, my brother.
- You're a spy?
- You remember what I just said about freaking out? I think you're doing that right now, and-and... and you shouldn't do that.
- You're a spy?
- Stay with me, buddy, okay?
- You two can kiss and make up later.
- Where are Shaw's files?
- Now, Chuck!
- We've got visitors.
- Colonel Casey and Agent Walker decided to join the party.
- Casey and Sarah are spies, too?
- You have a lot of catching up to do.
- Excuse me while I take care of your friends.
- We'll save the torture for later.
- No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- I can't... I can't believe it.
- All this time, you kept this a secret?
- From me?
- I'm so sorry, Morgan.
- You have no idea how badly I've wanted to tell you.
- All this lying about where I've been.
- You know, making plans and breaking them.
- And... and all the time, all I've wanted to do is tell you all about it, but... but I had to protect you, too, you know?
- Please understand that.
- Wow...
- Wow!
- I don't...
- My best friend is a spy? !
- This is unbelievable!
- This is the best news I've ever heard!
- Holy smokes, it makes perfect sense, too.
- Why we stopped hanging out and talking.
- I thought I lost you, buddy. I thought I lost you.
- But you were out saving the world?
- Chuck, you are officially rehired as my best friend.
- Great. That's good news. Thanks.
- Oh, I have so many questions.
- I mean, wh-wh... where do I start?
- Uh, how did this happen?
- Did they recruit you at the Buy More? Stanford?
- Chuck? Yeah, I'm pretty sure we're going to die here, Chuck, so no time for secrets.
- You know what, you're right, buddy.
- You're right. And... and... and quite frankly, you deserve to know.
- So here goes... You ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, man.
- Okay.

- I'm calling Langley to activate it now.
- You can't destroy the Castle. Chuck is down there.
- So is every piece of intelligence we have.
- Not just on the Ring... Everything.
- Please, just give Chuck five more minutes, okay?
- For me.
- I'm sorry, Sarah, but you can't think of Chuck.
- You have to think like a spy.
- I am thinking like a spy. Chuck is a member of my team, and he has served this country well, and for all that he has done, the least we can do is just give him five more minutes.
- So, that's it.
- That's how it happened.
- So, now I got this thing in my brain...
- The Intersect, like I told you...
- You know, and... and it's not working.
- Anything else you want to know before we die?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
- Just one more.
- Um, so if Sarah is your handler, does that make her your beard?
- In other words, like, is your whole relationship a fake?
- 'Cause, oh, buddy, that's... that's just awful.
- Why? Because we never had sex?
- No, I just feel like, you know, having to be...
- You never had sex with that girl?
- That's not... No, no.
- It's... it's awful that you had to pretend to be in a relationship with somebody that you clearly love.
- Sarah and I are over, you know.
- No, you're not.
- You're a good liar, Chuck, but you're not that good.
- All right, you lied to me for three years, but I always knew you loved that girl.
- I mean, I saw the way you looked at her.
- We all did.
- It's okay.
- You don't have to deny it.
- Tell me you don't love Sarah.
- You know what, you're right, buddy.
- I do love Sarah.
- I kept telling myself that I didn't.
- That I wouldn't, I couldn't, but I do.
- Morgan, you have no idea how badly I needed to get all this off my chest.
- Thank you.
- Get rid of them.
- k\*ll them. Dump the bodies.
- Thank me later, buddy.
- We're about to die.
- No, you're not.
- Hey!
- Chuck, sword!
- Thanks, buddy.
- Mine's bigger than yours.
- That was incredible.
- You were incredible. You were like Bruce Lee, Van Damme, Seagal all rolled up into one.
- That's my best friend!
- Yeah, he's out. He's out.
- I couldn't get in.
- We're locked out.
- Time's up.
- This is Langley Control.
- Bag 'em and tag 'em, Sarah.
- Excuse me.
- Agent Walker.
- We'll just have to put Grimes in witness protection.
- Move him out of Burbank tonight after dark.
- What? Wait, wait, wait.
- No, no, no. Hang... hang on a second.
- Morgan is not going anywhere, okay?
- Chuck, he knows your secret.
- Yeah, well, so do a lot of people.
- Awesome knows, and we didn't put him underground.
- Yeah, because Awesome's awesome.
- Grimes is a moron.
- It's just too dangerous.
- We have no reason to believe that we can trust him.
- Yes, we do.
- We have 22 reasons why we can trust him.
- That's the number of years that Morgan has been my best friend.
- And, yes, he has his faults... granted... but one thing he is is loyal, and he will never betray me or my secret.
- He's right.
- Thank you.
- Look, I'm flashing.
- I'm a spy again because I have my best friend back.
- You need the Intersect, and I need him, so Morgan Grimes is staying exactly where he belongs, which is the Burbank Buy More.
- Hey. Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
- Sorry about the wait.
- No, no problem, no prob...
- Casey.
- Always walking around so angry.
- I should've known you had a big secret.
- God help us.
- So, yeah, everything's okay.
- That's great. Yes! I love to hear it.
- Okay, so am I, uh, like, officially part of the team or...
- Let's um...
- Let... let's walk before we run, huh, buddy?
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
- Definitely.
- And maybe crawl before that.
- Yeah, yeah. You know what, we should celebrate.
- Okay, little old-school game night...
- Duck Hunt, Subway meatball marinaras with extra jalapeños.
- That's how you like it.
- And, uh, just the two of us.
- Yeah, just the two of us.
- Buy More.
- Yes, hello.
- This is Craig Rogers from Buy More corporate.
- I heard what happened down there today.
- Interesting display you put on there.
- You... you calling to fire us or arrest us?
- Neither.
- I'm calling to hire you.
- Huh?
- Yesterday, I was planning on selling this store.
- But I spoke to the potential buyers, and from what I've heard, your store showed the most incredible display of store loyalty I've ever seen.
- The store is no longer for sale.
- Victory!
- No, I'm not kidding you.
- When was the last time you b\*at me at Duck Hunt?
- I am the old-school master.
- I...
- What are you... ? I want you to tell me... When was the last time that you b\*at me at Duck Hunt? That's... that's incredible.
- Uh, hey, keep these, uh, meatball subs warm for me, would you, buddy?
- I'll be right in.
- Um, I talked to Shaw, and I heard what happened.
- The Ring used me as a decoy. You said I was safe, bro.
- And you are.
- You... you will be, okay?
- We are doing everything that we can to make sure that you and Ellie are protected and safe.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- Are you okay? You've been a nervous wreck ever since this morning.
- Babe, we need to get away.
- We just got away.
- I'm talking about really getting away.
- You know, just you and me.
- Okay. Where do you want to go?
- Cabo?
- Further.
- Hawaii?
- No, no. Further.
- I'm talking about...
- Africa.
- Africa?
- We can join Doctors Without Borders.
- Doctors Without Borders?
- Honey, you didn't want to go to France.
- This is different, hon.
- I am talking about you and me traveling the world. What do you say?
- I don't know what to say.
- Say yes.
- This is crazy. We can't just up and leave.
- What about Chuck? I'm the only family that he has.
- But this isn't about Chuck.
- No, this is about you and me.
- Our family.
- Come on, babe.
- So, now that the Ring knows about the Castle, does that mean we have to shut down the operation?
- The Ring shut down all communications.
- They never had a chance to let their superiors know about their discovery.
- That'll buy us the time we need to put together a full offensive, take them down once and for all.
- So then, what's wrong?
- The Ring had me dead to rights today in Malibu.
- So why didn't they k\*ll me?
- So, Sarah and Casey... They're really spies, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. They're great.
- I trust them with my life.
- Are you kidding me?
- That is ridiculous, dude.
- Look at that sh\*\*ting.
- Are...
- You did your flash thingy on it.
- You flashed on Duck Hunt.
- Hello?
- Hello, Colonel Casey.
- It's been a while.
