# Chuck Versus the Angel de la Muerte

- Professor: Let's jump right in.
- Who would like to help me dissect the branches of the femoral artery?
- Anyone?
- No one?
- Fine.
- How about, uh, Mr. Woodcomb?
- Devon?
- Devon?
- Seems Devon has more pressing concerns on his first day of medical school.
- So perhaps, uh, Ms. Eleanor Bartowski would like to give me a hand, hmm?
- Well, wherever Mr. Woodcomb and Ms. Bartowski are, I hope they're gaining an appreciation of the human body.
- ♪ ♪
- What did you say your name was? Devon.
- Yours? Ellie.
- Pleasure to meet you, Ellie.
- You know, I don't normally make out with strangers in broom closets like this.
- (slamming)
- We're not strangers.
- Remember?
- I'm Devon, you're Ellie.
- Oh, God, I love med school.
- (laughs) (moans)
- Broom! Broom! Broom!
- Have you seen the broom?
- Can you forget about the TV?
- I just broke another one of our wedding plates.
- I can do this.
- I just have to channel my inner Chuck.
- Chuck who?
- That person's dead to me.
- Relax, babe, I have nine years of post-graduate education.
- I can figure out a stupid TV set.
- You know, he said he was gonna help us move.
- No excuses.
- Well, honey, you remember how it is.
- He's young, fancy-free.
- Probably just slipped his mind.
- Honey, look at this.
- This is our wedding album.
- Is it just me or does this feel like a million years ago?
- What happened to us?
- Well, we moved.
- We went back to work.
- Real life happened.
- Well, when do we get to take a break from real life?
- When do we get to be these people again?
- Okay, here's the deal.
- Enough moving for one night.
- I'm gonna get us some real food, we're gonna sit on this couch and we're gonna watch our wedding video.
- And then maybe later we can recreate our wedding night.
- What about the TV?
- (helicopter approaching)
- That's a job for a professional.
- (helicopter hovering above)
- Is it just me or has there been like a lot of helicopters lately?
- Hmm.
- Hadn't noticed.
- (yells)
- Sorry, dude.
- Didn't mean to scare you.
- Really?
- Well, then maybe you shouldn't be sneaking into my room in the middle of the night.
- Well, then maybe you should tell your pilot to land a little farther from the apartment.
- Oh, right.
- Sorry about that.
- The thing is, he doesn't really know the Echo Park area all that well.
- But, uh, we'll work on that.
- Hey, can you, uh, do me a favor and help me get out of this thing right here?
- Just pull down on the...
- Where were you tonight?
- You told Ellie that you were gonna help us out with the TV.
- She's a little pissed, bro.
- Oh, man, my bad.
- I had a, uh, CIA mission.
- What exactly does that mean?
- Well, you know, same old, same old.
- Bad guy throws a fancy cocktail party.
- Another bad guy's trying to sell him a w\*apon.
- We bust both bad guys, diffuse a b\*mb.
- Blah, blah, blah.
- That sounds kind of kickass.
- What do you got under there?
- Body armor.
- You might want to leave that on when you come over.
- Like I said, your sister's about to blow.
- All right.
- Chuck, you could've been a surgeon with those hands.
- He could've been a lot of things.
- I would settle for being on time.
- That should do it.
- Try it now.
- (remote clicks on)
- It has been reported, Premier Alejandro Goya collapsed shortly after...
- Oh, oh, look at that.
- I take it back, you're a genius.
- I'm gonna get the wedding DVD.
- This visit to the U. S. is the first for the outspoken Costa Gravan leader.
- Goya has ruled his small nation ever since a Communist coup in 1974.
- Speaking of collapsing, Chuck, you okay?
- Huh, what?
- Yes, yeah.
- I'm fine; I'm a little light-headed.
- That's all.
- (phone ringing)
- I gotta run.
- What is it? Another mission?
- Huh, something with Premier?
- You know, I'm sorry, buddy, it's spy stuff; it's confidential.
- (phone ringing)
- Where are you going?
- Sorry, buddy, doctor stuff.
- Confidential. Hmm.
- Ellie: Hey!
- What happened to recreating our wedding night?
- Sorry, babe. Duty calls.
- I will make it up to you, I promise.
- Beckman: The Costa Gravan premier is listed in critical condition.
- Outstanding. Want me to crack the bubbly?
- No. I want you to go to the hospital and guard against further threats to his life, natural or otherwise.
- But haven't you personally given me the order to k\*ll that commie crackpot on three separate occasions?
- And three times, you have failed to complete your orders.
- I thought you said you had a perfect record.
- Wow. This is getting entertainingly uncomfortable.
- Beckman: Our relations with Costa Gravas have changed, Colonel.
- The premier is here to announce plans to open his nation up to democratic elections.
- Oh, and you believe that?
- Our duty is to stop anyone who would stop him from going through with his plan.
- Understood?
- Yes, ma'am. SARAH: So, we're assuming this was an assassination attempt?
- We're not assuming anything until we've secured his medical records.
- That brings me to your assignment.
- The premier is being treated at...
- Let me guess.
- Westside Medical?
- Correct.
- (speaking Spanish)
- ... he's stable.
- (heart monitor beeping rhythmically)
- Everybody relax. The doctor's here.
- Chuck: General, are you suggesting that I exploit my sister and/or brother-in-law to acquire confidential medical records for governmental use?
- Yes, Chuck, that's exactly what I'm suggesting.
- (snaps fingers) I knew it. I was on...
- Wait. Hold on a second, General.
- If anything happens to the premier, I'm holding you responsible.
- If anything happens to this man, I'm holding you responsible.

- In a miraculous turn of events, the Costa Gravan premier is being released from the hospital just hours after being rushed to the emergency room.
- Right now, we go to Westside Medical for a live press conference.
- Reporter: Dr. Woodcomb? REPORTER 2: Dr. Woodcomb?
- REPORTER 3: It was reported that the premier suffered heart failure.
- How do you account for his amazing recovery?
- I can only say this.
- The premier is an amazing man, a real fighter.
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Dr. Woodcomb? Dr. Woodcomb?
- Reporter: ÿCuales son la probabilidades del premier volviendo al trabajo?
- What is the probability of the premier returning to work?
- Hmm. Las probabilidades de que se reincorporan al trabajo es muy Awesome.
- Is there anything your brothe r-in-law can't do?
- Well, thus the nickname.
- Okay, enough sitting around.
- We need to figure out what really happened to the premier.
- Let's go apprehend the good doctor, get those medical records out of him.
- Nobody is apprehending anybody.
- He's family. I can talk to him.
- Just remember, Chuck, he's a civilian, so be cool.
- Hello. (laughs)
- Sorry, bro. Didn't mean to scare you.
- You didn't.
- I didn't?
- Whatever.
- Listen, there's a few questions I need to ask you.
- It's about the premier, right?
- Sure you want to talk about this here, hmm?
- Doesn't the CIA want to debrief me or something?
- I am debriefing you.
- That's what I'm doing right now. This is a debriefing.
- I mean, in your secret base.
- Secret... You've watched too many movies.
- Just tell me what you know about the premier.
- Well, I know he didn't really have a heart attack.
- His potassium level was off the charts.
- I don't know how it got into his system... So he was poisoned.
- Okay, that's all I needed to know. Thanks.
- Whoa, Chuck, you know, if there's anything else I can do?
- No. You've been great.
- No. Seriously.
- If the CIA needs an extra set of hands...
- Good to know.
- Chuck, you're not hearing me.
- Okay? Nothing against married life, but I could use some real excitement.
- Devon, you're an adventure sports cardiologist.
- Whatever, man. I can do that in my sleep.
- You know, I need some real action.
- Some real adrenaline.
- I want to feel like I felt out on the football field, dude.
- You know, I can still run a fou r-four-40. Great.
- If we ever need a tight-end, you're the first call I'm making, but until then, you're my brother-in-law. Ellie... would k\*ll me.
- Beckman: Thanks to your brother-i n-law's intelligence, we have to assume that the assassin is still in play.
- There's an event at the Costa Gravan Consulate this evening.
- I need your team there to guard the premier.
- You want us to break in?
- Technically, that's invading sovereign soil.
- Beckman: That is why the CIA has no official knowledge of this mission.
- Uh, just spit-balling here, General.
- Why don't we just tell the premier that his life is in danger?
- Would you trust a country that spent the better part of three decades trying to k\*ll you?
- Hmm. Yeah.
- Your protection must go undetected.
- What? So, that-that's... that's it?
- If we get busted, then the CIA disavows us, and then we rot for the rest of our lives in a Costa Gravan prison?
- In Costa Gravas, the punishment for sedition is death by firing squad.
- Casey: Just my kind of mission.
- Too bad I have to recuse myself.
- What? He's bailing? You're bailing on us?
- I can't show my face on Costa Gravan soil, I'm a wanted man.
- You know what they'd do if they knew I was in Los Angeles?
- I spilled more bl\*od than that Mickey Mouse revolution than any other... (laughing)
- Don't you think you're being a little paranoid?
- They call me el Angel de la Muerte.
- The Angel of Death. Please.
- Bro, it was the '80s.
- Come on.
- You really think the premier gives a flying crap about you, John Casey?
- Oh, no! It's the Angel of Death!

- Casey: Yeah, copy that.

- Casey: Chuck, keep a lookout for any potential assassins.
- (pounding)
- (clears throat)
- So, what's the plan, bro?

- Sorry, Chuck. My mission's not over.
- Casey: You know that man you're trying to save turned his country into a pariah state.
- Do you have any idea how many people he k\*ll?
- You're one to talk.
- Angel de la Muerte.
- Chuck: Look, look, he's not here as the Angel of Death right now, he's here to protect your boss; we all are.
- The real k\*ll's down in my cell.
- We found no one.
- Uh...
- Can't you see he's bleeding to death? Please!
- We will sort out who's trying to k\*ll who later; right now, we need to get this man to a doctor.
- He has a doctor.
- Little busy right now.
- Not you, him.
- Who "him"? Me, "him"?
- If you wish to prove you're not an assassin, save him.
- Okay.
- Okay, no, uh, no problem.
- No problem.
- We've done this before.
- We've done this many times.
- Uh, normally, I start with anesthesia.
- No! Huh?
- Okay.
- Okay, no anesthesia.
- No anesthesia. That's fine, that's fine.
- He's a big, tough man. He can deal with the pain.
- Captain: The b\*llet might've grazed his femoral artery. Whatever you do...
- (shushing)
- Let the doctor work.
- Nurse?
- Why don't you go ahead and cut those pants open, and we'll see what we're working with.
- Oh, oh...
- Oh, it's suddenly very hot in here.
- It's very, very hot in here.
- Can somebody crack a window?
- No!
- Just as I thought.
- Captain: Chuck, you've got the hands of a surgeon, bro.
- Don't think about the g\*n.
- He's not your friend. He's your patient.
- Sarah: Chuck, you can do this.
- Just relax.
- Nurse, suction.
- Scalpel.
- Tweezers.
- Gauze.
- Iodine.
- Forceps.
- Just like Operation...
- The game.
- (groaning)
- (groaning continues)
- (groaning subsides)
- (machine beeping) What's wrong?
- I told you. There's nothing I could do for him here.
- Nothing short of a bl\*od transfusion.
- I don't even know what bl\*od type he is.
- (mumbles): AB negative.
- What?
- (grumbles): AB negative.
- Aah! (spits)
- His bl\*od type's AB negative.
- What? You learn a lot about a guy when you're trying to k\*ll him.
- What else you want to know?
- His favorite movie's Terms of Endearment.
- He always showers after lovemaking...
- Okay, none of that's going to save him now.
- We need someone with type AB negative bl\*od, now. Someone big.
- Does anyone have type AB negative bl\*od?
- ÿAlguien aqui tiene sangre tipo AB negativo?
- Quick! Find someone! Anyone!
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Put those back!
- Give me that!
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- You take one drop of bl\*od from me, I swear to God, I'll rip off your...
- (muffled): No! No! No!
- (exclaiming, laughing)
- Hey, Chucky.
- Oh, I feel like death.
- What happened?
- You're just in time, big boy.
- Time for what?
- Congratulations, the premier made a full recovery.
- Although I do not endorse your methods, you enabled him to make his announcement as planned.
- Costa Gravas will have its first democratic election.
- And it wouldn't have been possible without your extraordinary sacrifice.
- I got sh\*t, that's nothing extraordinary.
- You don't remember? Huh?
- Remember what?
- You stole my bl\*od.
- You stole my bl\*od, and you put in a stinking commie despot.
- Former stinking commie despot. Thank you.
- Beckman: The premier wanted to thank you personally, Colonel Casey.
- But this will have to do.
- Huh?
- Premier Goya: I wish to thank you on behalf of Costa Gravas and myself.
- I will never forget that the bl\*od of an American patriot flows through my veins.
- John Casey, you truly are the Angel of Life.
- Casey: These are prerevolutionary Costa Gravas double coronas.
- Oh...
- Hey. Hey.
- How'd it go with headquarters?
- Yeah, uh, we didn't get a new mission, if that's what you're wondering.
- Oh, no way.
- I think I scratched my espionage itch.
- Don't get me wrong.
- Black tie dinners and embassy extractions are k\*ll, but... just not worth it.
- What's not?
- If having a double life means having to give up half of your real life, that's just not how I want to live, bro.
- ♪ ♪
- I got to run.
- I've got to finish a few things at the hospital, and then home to my wife.
- You two take care of each other.
- He would've made an awesome spy.
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess it runs in the family.
- (chuckles)
- Uh, listen, I've been, um...
- I've been meaning to ask.
- What do you think our cover should be, you know, moving forward?
- Well, I think we should keep it simple.
- So, how about friends?
- Friends, huh?
- Yeah, that could work.
- I suppose I could fake being friends with someone like you.
- And I don't find you completely repulsive, so... Thanks.
- So, yeah. Friends?
- Yeah. Yeah, friends.
- So, what exactly do friends do?
- What do friends do? Uh, what is it? Friday night?
- Friday night, Morgan and I would normally gorge ourselves on some processed food, play some video games.
- Maybe we're not quite there yet.
- Okay, we can work on some other options.
- Yeah.
- Hi. CAPTAIN (on phone): Hey, babe.
- Where have you been?
- Kind of a crazy night.
- I got tied up at work.
- Well, why don't you hurry home.
- I have a surprise for you.
- One more patient and I am on my way.
- I believe I owe you a dance.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
- So, what seems to be the problem?
- Ouch, that looks like it hurts.
- You have no idea.
- (knocking at door)
- Hey.
- Changed your mind about tonight?
- What?
- What is it?
- (whispering)
- Oh, my God...
- Ellie: Hey, guys.
- Have you guys seen my husband?
