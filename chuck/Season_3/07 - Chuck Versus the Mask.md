# Chuck Versus the Mask

- Hi. I'm Chuck. Here's a few things that you might need to know.
- I just got fired from my job. Meeting you, almost makes it worth it.
- If you ever find yourself in burbank and is still without a job my assistant manager owes me about a million and a half favors.
- Here's the thing. I like her.
- I think there's something weird going on between Chuck and Devon, it's like they're keeping this big secret from me.
- Finally someone with some common sense.
- We have to figure out what's going on.
- Don't worry about it, I've got my best men on it.
- Perfect.
- Casey, things are getting a little hairy in here.
- Please tell me the Intersect isn't busy.
- Busy?
- For you? Never.
- I want you to teach me, Chuck.
- Oh, really? Do you?
- Well, I assume that you're referring to the ancient art of Nerd Herding, but I must warn you, the road to computer enlightenment is a long and treacherous one.
- Bring it on.
- Speaking of, how about you bring me on your next install?
- Whoa, easy there.
- Before you can run, you must first learn to crawl, young grasshopper.
- Okay. Well, maybe you would prefer to go with Jeff, then.
- Just the two of you, cramped into that tiny, hot Nerd Herd mobile.
- Well played, newbie.
- Next assignment, you get to ride g*n.
- Nice.
- Excuse me for just one second.
- What's going on? I'm in the middle of something here.
- It's Shaw. It's bad.
- Can't it wait?
- No. Not unless you want him to suffocate to death.
- Suffocate to death? What are you talking about?
- 'Sup, Hannah?
- Hey, just wanted to let you know, if you need anyone to show you around the, uh, Buy More...
- Who is that?
- Super hot blonde, heart of ice?
- Yeah, that's Chuck's ex, Sarah.
- Oh. What's their deal?
- Well, deal is Sarah dumped his ass and, uh, broke his heart.
- And now she can't resist coming back here to stomp on it.
- Look at my boy.
- Ah, poor sap.
- Everything all right, buddy?
- Yeah, got to run. Nerd Herd emergency.
- Right now? I didn't get the call and technically, all onsites should run through the assistant manager.
- I gu... Wait, where are you going?
- You heard the boss. Nerd Herd emergency.
- Ah, Carry on.
- Wait a minute. I'm the boss.
- Hey.
- Took you long enough.
- Yeah, good to see you, too.
- You mind telling me what Shaw's doing breaking into a museum vault?
- Forget it. He's only got five minutes of air left.
- Fine. What am I doing?
- Getting on the museum's server, rebooting the system, and opening the vault door before Shaw gets snuffed.
- They're never going to let me on their server, Casey.
- Well, I took the liberty of crashing it.
- It was the only way to stop the alarm.
- Unless you get on that server, there's no way to open the vault door. Now get in there, Bartowski.
- Oh, you're here. Thank heavens someone called you.
- Yeah, uh, what seems to be the problem?
- I'm the curator of Classical Art.
- I've never even touched one of these machines in my life.
- All I know is the museum went into full lockdown mode.
- It's designed to protect the collections from fire, but unless you fix it, there's no way to control the temperature or-or the humidity.
- Some of these pieces are extremely sensitive.
- So am I, Chuck.
- Chuck, we're in the crawl space above the vault.
- We're trying to get the door open.
- It's four inches of solid steel.
- We could try blowing the hatches.
- We'll have to use C4.
- No. Shaw's too close. You're going to k*ll him.
- It's up to you, Chuck.
- You've got to get this door open.
- Some of these artifacts are over 3, 000 years old.
- To have survive that long and then to be ruined by some stupid computer system.
- You know, if you don't mind, I could really use a little breathing room.
- Hmm.
- That's right. Step aside.
- We are the professionals.
- Hannah, what are you doing here?
- Surprise. I saw your Nerd Herder parked outside the museum.
- And you said that I could ride g*n.
- So, what's the problem?
- Get rid of her, Chuck.
- Shaw's got less than a minute.
- Look, I don't care which of you it is, but please do something.
- Have you ever restarted a server from the backup database?
- Oh, now you're just insulting me.
- Show me what you got.
- Run the context script off server one.
- Validated. Next?
- Just blow the hatch.
- Blow the hatch.
- What about the mask?
- I'm dying.
- Roger that.
- Fire in the hole.
- No, don't!
- Don't, computer. Don't do...
- I'm just talking to the computer.
- 'Cause sometimes, I feel like it helps. Ha.
- I need you to reboot on the count of three.
- One, two...
- Oh, my God. We did it!
- We did it! Hi!
- We did it!
- Not bad for your first mission.
- Splendid work, absolutely top notch.
- Really, I mean, I can't thank you enough.
- Well, you know, hey. Any time.
- Oh, all right. Um, how about tomorrow night?
- What?
- Well, it's the unveiling of the Mask of Alexander.
- Everyone in the art world's going to be there, and I'd like you to be also.
- Not that I don't appreciate the invitation...
- Oh, no, no. I'm not inviting you. I'm hiring you.
- I want you there to ensure that, well, there's no more, uh, what do you call them?
- Bugs.
- Take the job, Chuck.
- You and your new partner are going to help us steal the Mask of Alexander.
- So, what do you say, partner?
- It's a date.
- Magnificent. Isn't it?
- What is that?
- Double sh*t Americano. No cream, no sugar.
- The way you like it.
- Oh, I almost forgot.
- I noticed you like to chew them when you get nervous.
- Hey, gang.
- Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?
- Thanks for joining us, gentlemen.
- I'm sure you've all guessed that the CIA is not interested in stealing the Mask of Alexander.
- We believe that this artifact and possibly others, are being used to smuggle items through Customs.
- What sort of items?
- Items of interest to the Ring.
- This was three months ago at the National Museum of Damascus.
- A team broke in, but didn't take anything.
- You think the Ring broke in just to hide something inside the mask?
- That's pretty smart. Traveling exhibitions don't have to go through normal screening.
- All I know is that we have to secure the mask before the Ring does.
- Chuck, you'll be in the museum's control room in case we have any other snags.
- Casey, you'll handle surveillance.
- Sarah, you and I will pose as guests at the party.
- We'll break in and swap the mask, before the unveiling with this reproduction. Any questions?
- Concerns?
- You mean other than us bringing a civilian on the mission?
- I do have some new tranq darts I'd like to try out.
- No, no. I can handle Hannah.
- Besides, she can cover for me in my Nerd Herd duties in case you guys need to call in the big g*n.
- And that would... that would be me.
- When I say "big g*n", I'm referring to the Intersect, to myself.
- You know, if I need to flash.
- Glad we had this talk.
- Morgan.
- Hey.
- Chuck would freak if he knew we were meeting like this.
- Morgan, you told me that Jeff and Lester would get to the bottom of Chuck's secret.
- I may have overstated their abilities at bit.
- What I can tell you is that Chuck is hardly ever at work.
- Always ducking in and out on, uh, weird Nerd Herd calls.
- Yeah. Like his mysterious trip to Paris.
- He's been acting weird ever since.
- Right. You want to know what I think?
- Not really.
- All right.
- I think Chuck's protecting us.
- Protect us from what?
- I don't think he wants us to know that he's gone to the dark place.
- Oh, you don't mean...
- Yeah. Junior year. When Jill dumped him.
- Sat in his room and played GoldenEye for what, three months?
- Who knew you could get bedsores from playing video games?
- This makes total sense.
- This time, Sarah breaks Chuck's heart, sends Chuck into an emotional tailspin.
- Oh, let's not panic. Let's not panic.
- I'll... I'll see what I can find out, you know?
- How?
- I'm the assistant manager at the Buy More, okay?
- I have my methods.
- All right, Let's see here. Phillips head screwdriver set?
- Check.
- Dummy artifact?
- Check.
- Harnesses?
- Check.
- And needle-nose pliers.
- Check.
- Descender line.
- Check.
- Fantastic.
- Well...
- Lock and load.
- You ready, Agent Walker?
- Of course I'm ready.
- It's just, this is our first mission in the field, so...
- I want to make sure that we're both on the same page.
- Hmm.
- So, you ready for your first mission, Hannah?
- Mission?
- Well, I'm just trying to say that, you know, you never know what's going to happen out there outside the protection of the Buy More.
- You and me, we're... we're going behind enemy lines.
- Okay.
- You know, maybe we should talk about how many dates we've been on.
- You know, we are playing a couple tonight, so...
- What do you think?
- Uh, one, two?
- Five?
- Does it really make a difference?
- It informs our cover.
- Our chemistry, body language.
- For instance, have we slept together yet?
- You got to be kidding me.
- No, it changes the whole dynamic.
- Well, in that case, no, we definitely have not slept together.
- Good to know.
- All right, well, uh, make yourselves comfortable.
- I trust I shan't be seeing either of you two again this evening.
- The vault is scheduled to open at precisely 8:00.
- The unveiling must go off without a hitch.
- No more bugs, no more crashes, no more...
- No problem.
- Problems.
- The mask is in this vault.
- It opens at 8:00.
- Doesn't give us much time to make the swap.
- I thought I made myself clear about our cover.
- Just because we haven't slept together doesn't mean we have to act like this is a middle school dance.
- Over there, behind that door, is a staircase that leads up to the top of the vault.
- Keep an eye out on the security cameras up to your right and straight ahead.
- Are we good, Agent Walker?
- Yes, we're fine.
- Thank you.
- Man, it really is impressive...
- The size of Alexander's empire.
- You know what I mean?
- Can you keep a secret, Chuck?
- Huh? Uh... uh...
- Yeah, yeah, it's, uh, kind of my forte.
- Do you want to know the real reason that I took this job?
- Um... Was it the snazzy outfits?
- No, it was the barely livable wage.
- You.
- Uh... me... me? Really, me?
- It's not like I haven't been giving you signals.
- I hope this isn't too forward.
- No.
- No, forward is good.
- In that case...
- What did I do?
- What did I... Is there something wrong?
- You and your ex-girlfriend...
- Yeah, what? Who? Sarah?
- Yeah. Morgan said that you guys were done.
- 100% done-zo. Why?
- That is her, right?
- Any idea what she's doing here?
- Other than making you jealous with that ridiculously good-looking date of hers.
- R... ridiculously good...
- Him? Him? Nah.
- Yeah, if you're into the... the strong, kind of Superman-y type of a guy.
- Um, I am going to be right back.
- Chuck, what are you doing here?
- The Ring agent who broke into the museum in Damascus, Vasillis, is here, and when I say "here", I mean in the same room, here.
- Look over there.
- We have to abort.
- We don't have a choice.
- Vasillis and I have a history.
- Are you sure he remembers you?
- You tend to remember the guy who set your face on fire.
- Uh, yeah, looks like your friend isn't alone, either.
- They're casing the place.
- They're here to grab the mask.
- We better move right now.
- I'm not sending you in alone.
- Hey, it's okay. No problem. I'll go with her.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.
- Get out of here, Shaw, unless you want to blow the cover.
- Chuck and I can handle the mask.
- All right.
- Casey and I will be in the van if you need us.
- Well, what do you say, partner?
- Let's go.
- Watch those security cameras.
- We have to assume the Ring has tapped into those, as well.
- Yeah, I'm, uh, one step ahead of you.
- Sorry, Hannah.
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What's that beeping noise?
- Uh... And where's your partner?
- Um, he's, uh...
- Actually, I don't know.
- Look, people have traveled from all over the world to be here tonight.
- Now, I don't care what's going on, just fix it.
- You have five minutes until the grand unveiling.
- Now, go!
- Okay, you're going to have to lower me into the vault by hand.
- Here.
- So... you and Shaw looked like you were having fun at the party tonight.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I'm just saying... you two make a cute couple.
- Shaw and I are playing a cover.
- Whatever.
- But the guy's a...
- Walker and Bartowski turn off their mics for some reason?
- No, I did.
- Those two gab like little schoolgirls when they're out in the field. It's m*rder on the ears.
- That's ridiculous.
- Ridiculous?
- He couldn't keep his hands off of you all night.
- And the way he brings you coffee every morning?
- Seriously?
- You don't see the... You got to be blind.
- You're one to talk.
- Well, what is that supposed to mean?
- Oh, nothing. It's just that, ever since Hannah showed up at the Buy More, she hasn't been able to keep her hands off you.
- Cut the girl a break.
- You guys are cute together.
- Hannah and I are colleagues.
- Forgive me for trying to be professional.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I didn't realize professional meant having her perfume lathered all over you.
- Come on. We got a mask to steal.
- Sir, we're ready.
- Vasillis sent his men into the vault.
- They must have the code.
- Walker, you've got company.
- Bartowski, you copy?
- Incoming.
- My hands are kind of full here.
- Hi there.
- Sarah.
- Chuck.
- Hang on, Chuck. I got you.
- Okay.
- It's five past 8:00.
- Why isn't the vault opening?
- Keep your shirt on. Almost there.
- Almost there.
- Yes!
- Bartowski, I thought you took care of the vault.
- It's the girl, Hannah.
- She must be using Bartowski's laptop.
- We still tapped in remotely?
- Go.
- Opening the vault right now.
- Thank you so much.
- Oh...
- No, no.
- Why is this happening? Why is this happening?
- Oh...
- Oh...
- Chuck.
- I got it, I got it! Chuck.
- She broke the connection.
- Come on, man.
- Go, go, go, go!
- Clear! Clear!
- We're clear.
- Ta-da.
- Hey. I'll meet you back at Castle.
- Just give me a few minutes to pack up and smooth things over with Hannah.
- Bye.
- Hey, Hannah.
- Sorry about that.
- Where the hell have you been?
- How could you abandon me like that on my first Nerd Herd assignment?
- Forget it. I know where you were.
- You do?
- Yes.
- I saw you with your ex-girlfriend.
- Why would you tell me that things were over between you when they're clearly not?
- It's... it just... it's not what you think.
- Okay. Then, what is it?
- Sarah and I have a very... unique relationship.
- Wow.
- That sounds really special.
- I... I cannot believe that I made such an ass out of myself, kissing you like that.
- No, no!
- You didn't make an ass out of yourself. I'm... I'm the ass.
- Yes, clearly.
- I think we should just keep things professional between us from now on.
- No, Hannah, let... let me make it up to you.
- Forget it.
- Chuck, don't bother.
- I'll see you at work.
- That's, like, six knocks short.
- I don't know the knock.
- Can I come in?
- Yes, yes, he's asleep.
- He didn't get home till God knows when after doing God knows what.
- Wait, I thought he was at work.
- Yeah, so did I till I got a pissed off call from the museum.
- Chuck bailed on a Nerd Herd and left his partner behind.
- Does that sound familiar?
- That's great.
- So now we're back at square one.
- Not necessarily.
- I had an epiphany last night.
- What's that?
- It's a sudden, intuitive realization.
- I looked it up.
- I know what an epiphany is, Morgan.
- I'm asking what epiphany you had.
- Ah, right, well, I think that we might be going about this all wrong.
- Okay, let's just sit Chuck down and have an intervention, force him to be honest with us.
- It's the only way to get to the bottom of this.
- Get to the bottom of what?
- Nothing, probably my breakfast.
- No, what? Good morning.
- Hi, morning. Morning, Ellie.
- Okay, well, we're going to be late for work.
- Oh, look at that.
- My goodness.
- You...
- We can't do this right now.
- What are you talking about?
- You just said "intervention".
- What is wrong with you?
- You are a coward.
- That's who stole my mask.
- Pause it.
- Who is she?
- Oh, he's good.
- A real Casanova, this one.
- He used the blonde to get into the vault and seduced the computer girl to access the security system.
- It's time to see how coldhearted our thief really is.
- Tough night at the museum?
- Curator called me and gave me an earful.
- Oh, really? What did he say?
- You know, I don't really know.
- I have a hard time making out British accents, you know.
- To me, it's just "Oi, blighty this. "
- You know, it kind of just reminds me of Mrs. Doubtfire, which is an awesome flick.
- So what did happen last night?
- Well, you know, I... I don't want to point any fingers...
- Don't snitch... code of the streets.
- What are you talking about?
- Well, your loyalty to Chuck.
- You know, I get it. You want to protect your boss, but here's the thing.
- I'm his boss is what I'm saying.
- Actually, I don't want you to think of me as your boss' boss.
- I'd rather you think of me as a friend ultimately, you know, and a friend you can tell anything to.
- And I do mean anything.
- Excuse me.
- Hello. Nerd Herd.
- I'm calling from the museum.
- Another doofus with an accent.
- Can you believe this?
- How may I help you?
- We are still having problems with our computer system.
- Perhaps you can send the girl you sent last night.
- Uh, you must mean Hannah.
- Right.
- Hannah.
- Absolutely, I think she'd be happy to come back out, and in fact, to make up for the hiccup, it's on the house.
- I can even send her supervisor along.
- But I... cannot do that actually, um...
- He is busy.
- I'm sure she'll be able to handle the problem herself.
- She-she will indeed, absolutely.
- Okay.
- Thank you, Morgan, you are a great friend.
- That's very sweet of you... and also very poignant because...
- I believe that that's a great place to start, you know, and then we can build from there.
- Oh, God.
- Good morning, Walker.
- Okay, we need to talk.
- About last night?
- About everything.
- About professional boundaries, about you bringing me coffee to work every morning and noticing that I like to chew on my swizzle sticks.
- You're embarrassing us both.
- We are just colleagues and that is all we are ever going to be, so please keep your coffee and your cheesy come-ons to yourself.
- Okay, you got that?
- Good, now let's get back to work.
- I feel like I should probably apologize to Colonel Casey.
- Hey, Shaw, thanks for the coffee.
- Just the way I like it. Black and bitter.
- Hello?
- Nerd Herd.
- Hi, someone called.
- Yes, thank you for coming.
- Where's the old curator?
- He's tied up.
- I'm the assistant curator.
- This way.
- We've been having problems with the security system in the vault, if you don't mind having a look.
- I really just fix computers.
- You seem like a smart girl.
- You'll figure it out.
- Oh, you don't happen to have a phone?
- No, I left it in the car.
- Don't worry.
- Hey.
- Hey!
- Nerd Herd. How can I help you?
- You can bring me my mask.
- Uh, I think you might have the wrong number, sir.
- Let me rephrase.
- Either you bring me the mask or I k*ll your girlfriend.
- Morgan, have, uh, have you seen Hannah?
- Yeah, she's out on a call. Something at the museum.
- Sir, first of all, I... I don't have a girlfriend, just for clarification's sake, and second, like I mentioned earlier, this is the Nerd Herd desk, so unless you have a computer-related...
- I know who you are.
- If you want to see the girl alive, you'll come to the museum and come alone.
- She runs out of air in 30 minutes.
- Bring me my mask.
- Hey, buddy.
- Uh, here we go.
- Chuck, I think we need to talk.
- Not a good time.
- You know what? I don't care anymore.
- Listen, I'm your best friend, dude, or at least I used to be, and I deserve to know what...
- No, I demand to know what the hell is going on with you lately.
- Chuck... You got to be kidding me.
- Hmm, check the base.
- Chuck.
- Sarah...
- Sarah, I need the mask now.
- Vasillis knows we took it and he wants it back. He grabbed Hannah.
- I'm coming down the tunnel.
- That can't be good.
- Uh, Chuck, don't come in here. We think the mask is some kind of a...
- No.
- Oh, no.
- Guys, guys, it's poison.
- You think?
- It's a designer w*apon developed for battlefield use, but th... there's a counteragent that can be taken up to 30 minutes after exposure.
- Or what?
- Look, don't worry.
- I'm gonna get the counteragent from Vasillis.
- He wouldn't have shipped the w*apon without it.
- It's got to be back at the...
- Casey, gear up. We're heading back to the museum.
- This is never gonna work.
- It'll work.
- Here.
- Okay... okay, fine.
- So let's say we're able to fool Vasillis with another fake mask and we save Hannah.
- That still doesn't solve the problem of how we convince him to give us the counteragent.
- What about Sarah and Shaw?
- Do we have enough time to save them, too?
- Wait, wait, I got it, I got it.
- We gas him.
- That's a great plan, except the chemical w*apon's already been deployed.
- Yeah, but Vasillis doesn't know that.
- I got some smoke grenades in the back.
- Funny, I don't feel like I'm dying.
- Chuck will come through for us.
- In case he doesn't...
- I wanted to clear the air between us.
- It turns out I haven't been completely honest about, uh, the coffee and how I was acting at the museum.
- Truth is I was hitting on you.
- It was completely unprofessional and I apologize.
- I owe you an apology as well.
- I overreacted.
- The way you touched my neck at the party...
- I guess it was kind of nice.
- Really?
- Really.
- Well, then, I... I'm glad we had this talk.
- Yeah, me, too.
- The poison has been contained.
- The room has been cleared.
- We got to get you out of here.
- Stop there.
- Show me my mask.
- Show me my Nerd Herder.
- She's in the vault.
- Oh, look at the time.
- Air must be getting a little thin.
- If he doesn't open the door, I'm going to blow the vault.
- I can't promise she'll be okay.
- I did what you asked and I brought the mask.
- Now let her out.
- If it were up to me, sure.
- She would walk free.
- But the people you've stolen from, the Ring, they're not so forgiving.
- Do what you want to me but the girl had nothing to do with this.
- You're in no position to make demands.
- You gave up any leverage you might've had when you walked in with the mask.
- Not quite.
- I think we all know what's inside this mask.
- So either you open that door and let her out or I release the gas.
- I don't believe you.
- Well, that's too bad.
- You should've.
- You've k*ll us all.
- You idiot!
- Well, there's a counteragent, right? Where is it?
- It's in a vase.
- There's hundred of them.
- Which one?
- How am I supposed to know?
- I wasn't going to steal it personally.
- Oh, I see, and I'm the idiot?
- Come on, Chuck.
- One of these things is not like the others.
- Oh. Oh.
- Time's up, Chuck.
- No, Casey, wait!
- I found the counteragent.
- Meet me in the control room.
- When do I get to blow something up?
- Casey, here, here.
- How time we got left?
- Don't worry about that.
- You get her out of the vault.
- You don't have enough time, do you?
- Focus, Bartowski.
- Even if they are lost, we still have a civilian in there.
- Get her out of there!
- Come on, come on.
- Yes!
- Sarah? Shaw? What the... ?
- Here's the counteragent.
- I'll go release the curator.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you.
- Hannah? Hannah? Hannah?
- What happened?
- You, uh...
- You passed out and I think, uh, somehow you got trapped in the vault.
- Oh, my God.
- I could've died in here.
- You saved my life, Chuck.
- Well, I don't...
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, hey.
- Look, I know I was acting really weird the other night...
- Forget it.
- Nice work, everyone.
- And you...
- I owe you one, Bartowski.
- Oh, come on.
- Just 'cause I saved your life. Twice.
- Don't mention it.
- It wasn't just my life.
- Yeah.
- You also helped secure a rogue chemical w*apon.
- Guys.
- Look, I appreciate a ticker tape parade just like the next guy, but, come on, I got a great team.
- And that brings us to our next point of business.
- Well, uh, Chuck, you're not going to have us forever.
- The Intersect was originally designed so that agents could work autonomously.
- We're your training wheels.
- And your performance tells me that it's about time for us to come off.
- Hope you're ready for your big boy bike, Bartowski.
- Huh.
- Hey.
- Uh, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
- Yeah. I mean, I guess I've gotten used to us being a team, you know.
- Well, we're not going anywhere yet.
- But Shaw's right.
- At some point I'm just going to be standing in your way, and not just professionally.
- Right.
- Are you sure you're okay with the whole Hannah thing?
- Oh, I should've have given you a hard time.
- She's great and...
- How do you think I feel about you and Shaw?
- I mean, you two are perfect together.
- It's disgusting.
- Oh.
- In... in... in a heartwarming kind of way.
- Look, all I know is the guy carried you out of Castle on his back while you were both dying.
- So, if I have to see you with someone else it might as well be a hero, right?
- What can I say?
- I have a type.
- I'll see you, Sarah.
- Bye, Chuck.
- Well done on the knock.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Is Chuck here?
- Slinking around somewhere, yeah.
- Uh, you ready to do this?
- Time for an intervention.
- What is Chuck doing here so late?
- This is exactly the behavior I was talking about, Ellie, okay.
- Your brother...
- He is into something weird here.
- No, no...
- Cameras, cameras, cameras.
- Morgan, listen to me.
- Whatever is going on behind that door, we need to know about, okay?
- This is for Chuck.
- For Chuck.
- Yes.
- You go.
- You go.
- Okay, I will.
- Oh, my God!
- Chuck has a secret girlfriend.
- This means he's moving on with his life, and he's not wallowing in self-pity, and playing video games.
- This is such a relief.
- Such a relief.
- Man.
- Okay, I'm going to head out.
- You two coming?
- Uh, no, I'm going to finish up in here.
- Yeah, I'm... I'm pretty buried, too.
- So...
- Ah.
- We both know how dangerous this is.
- Relax, Sarah.
- I'm the safest guy in the world.
- Are you sure it was him?
- I'd never mistake Daniel Shaw.
- What are you going to do to him?
- Same thing I'm going to do to you.
