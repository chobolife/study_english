# Chuck Versus First Class

- The old heated doorknob. Nice try.
- Lester, you still giving me the silent treatment?
- Okay.
- Everybody, good morning.
- Good morning.
- Your coffee, sir.
- Ah, Jeffrey, thank you so much.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- You know, call me old-fashioned, but...
- I just... I prefer cream over laxative.
- I need everybody's attention.
- I know some of you are unhappy that I'm running the Buy More.
- I'm sorry.
- But all your little tricks and your tactics...
- I know them all.
- I taught you them.
- So listen up.
- No more sabotage.
- Thank you.
- Lester, you're in my chair.
- If there's one thing I learned in Hawaii, is that I'm good at this, men.
- I am good at the Buy More.
- Do me a favor and grab Chuck for me?
- Could somebody grab Chuck for me?
- Hey, Jeff, can you send Chuck back here for me?
- Chuck!
- Casey, I want to ask you about a Beastmaster.
- Really?
- No, not really.
- Hey, have we got any more info on you-know-who down in Castle?
- Shaw?
- Yeah, yeah, Shaw.
- I'm busy here, Chuck. Why don't you talk to him yourself? He's living there.
- Living in Castle. What? What? !
- Casey, what's going on?
- Is he really in charge of our team?
- Shaw's a special agent for the CIA.
- He can do pretty much whatever he wants.
- Even more special than me?
- It gets worse.
- Whenever a special agent takes over an operation, they conduct a review.
- Sarah's in there with him right now.
- What do you think they're talking about?
- Is Chuck Bartkowski a real spy?
- Yes, of course he is.
- I mean, his training has been irregular and he was a civilian only two years ago.
- Well, these mission reports tell a different story.
- Sometimes he sounds like Bond, and other times it's like a Jerry Lewis movie.
- I need to know, is Chuck a liability?
- Wait. The review's about me? !
- Shouldn't Shaw be asking me about me?
- Where's the fun in that?
- Look, I am never gonna be able to escape this ridiculous cover if Shaw thinks I'm some moron civilian who just got unlucky enough to get a computer dumped in his head.
- Fine.
- Help.
- Morgan, did you get glued to a chair?
- Yes. Yes, I did, okay?
- The whole store's coming after me, dude.
- Lester went mute and refuses to talk to me.
- Maybe 'cause you fired him?
- I don't know.
- They've teamed up and formed, like, an evil cabal of tricksters.
- I haven't had an untainted cup of coffee in days.
- I need my free coffee, dude.
- You know, you give me five minutes running this popsicle stand, and we'd be ready.
- Ready for what?
- The Russians.
- Hey. Hey-hey-hey-hey.
- Guys, a little help.
- Is that... is that Shaw?
- Listen, I'm an integral member of this team, okay?
- My voice should be heard.
- Oh, your prepubescent little girl screams are gonna be duly noted.
- Actually, right now. He wants to see you.
- Look, Shaw, I'm quite certain that things have been said about either myself or my abilities as a spy, and while I concede that there are more traditional or professional spies out there...
- Chuck, this is my meeting.
- Right. Sorry.
- Please continue.
- I think we can all agree that this team has been dysfunctional the last two years.
- And I think I know what the problem is.
- The problem is them.
- What?
- What does that mean?
- It means he's a moron.
- Chuck, they coddle you.
- You could be a great spy, but they won't let you evolve.
- Really?
- I mean, yes, yes, really. He's right.
- Let me be a spy.
- Let me out of the car. I'm ready.
- No, Shaw, he's not.
- Duly noted... and ignored.
- Chuck, you're going on your first solo mission Undercover in Paris.
- Are you ready?
- Absolutely.
- Um, so what are we doing here exactly?
- Since your Intersect k\*ll can be glitchy, you'll need some basic spycraft for this mission.
- Have you ever used one of these?
- A pen?
- KGB-model tranq pen.
- Oh, yeah, Casey's got one of these.
- Aim it at your target's food or drink, and it's bedtime for bad guy.
- You want me to tranq Jeff?
- I can't do that.
- I've read everyone's file.
- Jeff Barnes will be just fine.
- Come on, Chuck, are you up for this?
- Yeah.
- Hey, Jeffy-Jeff.
- How's it hanging, brother?
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
- Um, what do you mean, "okay"?
- What are you doing?
- You don't usually check up on me like this.
- Did I do something wrong?
- No, no, no, no, buddy.
- Everything's fine.
- You're fine, work's fine, you know.
- This is more of a checking in.
- Just making sure that you're feeling okay.
- Just a little human- to-humanoid interaction, so...
- Good.
- Thanks, yeah. Little bit of a rocky start, but I think I finished strong. What's next?
- Let's go.
- You're ready.
- Wh... whoa. I am?
- I'm ready after 20 seconds?
- After two years.
- I just wanted to talk to you privately, Chuck.
- Listen, you've been on more missions than most spies have been in a lifetime.
- Trust me, you're ready.
- Ah...
- Freshly brewed, untouched by Jeff's lips.
- Checkmate, Lester. Checkmate.
- As assistant manager, I claim this cup of coffee for me.
- Mmm.
- Okay, that's what I'm talking...
- You guys got to understand something.
- You got to get up pretty early to get... a CIA contact will meet you in Paris.
- You're traveling as Carmichael, a successful businessman.
- Itinerary and passport.
- Guys, it's all good. I'm ready, okay?
- What are these?
- Nunchakus.
- You know very well that I don't like carrying g\*n around.
- But I thought it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have some kind of offensive w\*apon, you know, just to have with me just in case.
- And they're supposed to be in the Intersect, so...
- Casey, can I have a second?
- Hmm? Yeah.
- Listen, I know you want this to work and you want to impress Shaw, but this is crazy.
- Okay, fine, the nunchakus are a little crazy.
- You weren't supposed to see those.
- But Shaw... an honest-to-God, real-life special agent for the CIA...
- Thinks that I'm ready.
- He thinks that I can do it, and I want to prove to him that he's not wrong about me.
- I'm not saying that you can't do this, but please...
- Please just don't go now.
- Okay? You need more time.
- He's going.
- Beckman agrees with me.
- We set up a subnetwork on your phone.
- You'll be able to text and call from the plane.
- Your ticket, and your car's waiting outside.
- You'll receive further instructions in Paris.
- Oh, daddy!
- First class!
- That is... probably what you do for everybody.
- Okay, well, see ya later.
- I hope.
- Thank you.
- Welcome to first class, sir.
- May I take your jacket?
- You want to take my jack...
- Oh, yes, of course. Yes, sorry about that.
- There we go.
- Oh, actually, you know what?
- If I can just... Gotta get my phone and writing utensil. Okay.
- Lucky pen?
- Huh?
- Lucky pen?
- No, uh, no, just a... just a regular ol' pen-pen.
- Okay.
- I'm Chuck, by the way. I mean, Charles.
- I mean, my name is Charles, but my friends call me Chuck.
- I'm Hannah. Just Hannah, Chuck.
- Good, that makes it easy.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.
- May I offer either of you a drink?
- Ooh, uh, no. You know what?
- I'm on business, but thank you.
- Me, too. I'll have his.
- You know, on second thought, I think I will then.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- For you. Uh-huh.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
- So what do you think of our fellow passengers here in first class?
- I'm thinking Syrian dignitaries over there, couple of nuclear physicists, but that bunch, I don't know about them.
- That bunch over there?
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, I'm gonna go with Yale fencing team without a doubt.
- Spot-on.
- Oh, thanks.
- Now what about you, Charles-but-my-friends-call-me-Chuck?
- Uh...
- What about... what about me?
- Um, I'm in retail, very high-end merchandise at a very prestigious store.
- What the... ?
- Come on! Get me out of here!
- This is not...
- Hey, Casey.
- Oh, thank you.
- See that?
- See that? How do you do that?
- You command respect. I...
- No.
- I take it.
- Shaken, not stirred, sir.
- Thank you.
- You don't fly first class often?
- Well, uh...
- No, no, of course I do. All the time.
- LA to Paris.
- Paris to LA.
- What about you?
- Well, I, uh, I work for a private investor.
- Essentially, he just flies me around the world, and I fix problems for him, IT stuff.
- Computers, mainframes. It's terribly boring.
- And stress, a lot of stress.
- But I get to travel.
- And live in Paris.
- I have a view of the Eiffel Tower.
- No way. Really?
- Yeah. Have you been?
- To the Eiffel Tower? Yeah. So many times.
- Can't even count how many times.
- I know everything there is to know about it.
- Mr. Muscles?
- Let me take a gander.
- I'm thinking professional wrestler, maybe.
- I don't know. Tough to tell.
- Kind of nondescript, really.
- Don't you think?
- Would you excuse me for just a second?
- I got to use the little boys' room.
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Hey, guys, you there?
- Chuck, have you flashed yet?
- Yeah. How did you know I'd flash?
- Because your mission's not in Paris, Chuck.
- Your mission is on the plane.
- What do you mean, my "mission is on the plane"?
- What do you mean, "the mission is on the plane"?
- Hugo Panzer, the man you flashed on.
- He's a ring agent.
- He's moving a CIA crypto key to Paris.
- He'll have put it in cargo.
- You'll need to get his claim ticket, go to the cargo hold, find his bag, get the key.
- Yeah, I'm only seeing problems with that plan right now.
- Hugo Panzer is a bit on the large side.
- Chuck, I gave you the pen for a reason.
- You can do this.
- The pen. Of course.
- The pen. Tranq him, get the ticket.
- No problem.
- Chuck, please be careful.
- Hugo Panzer is very dangerous.
- He is a master at close-quarters combat.
- Sarah, don't you worry.
- I will have that key back before they serve the lobster.
- And by the way, I'm quite looking forward to that.
- Hello?
- You should have told me.
- And this is why I didn't.
- Chuck is not ready for Paris and he's certainly not ready for a mid-air mission.
- I mean, we can't even go in and help him.
- Well, now we find out if your asset is a real spy.
- Who are you, agent Shaw?
- Because, you know, I have never heard of you, and neither has Casey.
- You're a very well kept secret.
- I do like my secrets. Don't you?
- Being the daughter of a con man teaches you that.
- You really do read everybody's files.
- Of course.
- And I have a few questions for you.
- Seven months ago, when Chuck was in Prague, you went off grid for three days.
- This is a surveillance photo of a hotel in Lisbon.
- This is you.
- Beckman ordered you to stay in contact, but you ran. Why?
- It's not what you think.
- I don't know what to think.
- Are you a double agent?
- A ring operative?
- Or is this about Chuck?
- Excuse me, sir?
- Sorry to bother you.
- The woman that I'm sitting next to is a bit of a nuisance.
- Will not shut up.
- So I was kind of wondering if I could plop down here, if that's okay.
- Fine.
- Thanks. Awesome.
- Yeah, you know, I think she's an upgrade.
- It's such a bummer, too, because one of the things I love about first class is the opportunity to really socialize and rub elbows with people that are, you know, like-minded, and not the rabble. Don't you agree?
- Excuse me.
- Oh, yeah, sure. Do your thing.
- Crossword time!
- One across, "ecru".
- It's the air pressure.
- What? Huh?
- Pens don't always work on planes because of the pressure change.
- That... that's fascinating.
- Let me try.
- Oh, no, please don't...
- Sorry. Sorry about that. Sorry.
- That wasn't ink.
- Sir, this is first class.
- Who are you?
- Nobody.
- Who are you?
- KGB.
- Yeah?
- Any updates on Chuck?
- Relax, Casey. He's doing fine.
- Hey, John.
- Uh, do you have a second?
- I need a favor.
- Not interested.
- Oh, I hate to pull rank here, uh, John, but I am your superior.
- What?
- I need you.
- Okay, please help me.
- I don't know what they'll do next...
- Mute Lester and his gang.
- They've taken over the store.
- They set booby traps for me everywhere.
- I'm going crazy here.
- I can't fight them by myself anymore.
- They don't follow any rules.
- Insurgents?
- I hate insurgents.
- Then this will work out, I think.
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.
- I'm in the cargo hold, and it's friggin' freezing in here.
- Good job.
- Look for the matching ticket, find the key, get back to your seat.
- Come on.
- I'm right, aren't I?
- I should tell you, I'm always right.
- It's annoying, but true.
- Why don't you tell me what you're right about so I can tell you that you're wrong?
- My theory about you and Chuck.
- Most spies push their assets to perform.
- That's what I do.
- You protect him.
- You care for him.
- You followed him to Lisbon.
- That's not true.
- Come on.
- I was right about this mission, and I'm right about you.
- You know, Chuck isn't home free yet.
- What do you got, Chuck?
- I found it.
- It's a casket.
- Smart. The ring knows that customs won't check the body.
- Open it up.
- Find the key.
- That's kind of disgusting.
- Get it done, Chuck.
- Oh!
- Hi.
- Sorry about this.
- Where are you? Where is its? Ooh!
- Oh, dead hands. Dead, cold hands.
- Dead, cold... . Oh.
- Here we go.
- Ooh, that's disgusting.
- Gah! Dead skin, dead skin, dead skin.
- Jackpot.
- It's Chuck.
- Don't answer.
- He's taken care of Hugo. All he has to do is find the key.
- He shouldn't need to call.
- Sarah, pick up. Pick up your phone.
- And what if he's in trouble?
- Go ahead, answer it.
- Just know that if you do, he'll never be a real spy.
- And one day, that will get him k\*ll.
- Sorry. Sorry, old man.
- Sorry, old man.
- Don't freak out.
- Casey! Casey!
- Listen, I'm in a little bit of a pickle right now.
- I am currently trapped in a coffin with a recently deceased elderly man and a very large bad guy trying to find me.
- Aren't you still on the plane?
- Right, yes, I forgot to mention that part.
- The mission is on the plane.
- I have the key, but the ring operative is right outside.
- What do I do?
- You get taken.
- What? !
- The ring agent's gonna find you, because you picked the single dumbest place to hide.
- Oh, gee, thanks. Criticism is always welcome.
- When he does, you act like your little girlish self.
- You scream like a banshee, so he doesn't think you're a threat.
- When he pulls you out, you find a w\*apon and then flash.
- Well, what if I don't flash?
- Then you're dead... So flash.
- C... Casey...
- Chuck! Chuck!
- Yeah, Casey?
- Walker, Bartowski's in trouble.
- The ring operative has him.
- What? Chuck's been taken.
- I'm opening a line to his phone.
- I sincerely hope that that's not your father.
- Oh!
- You should've taken my watch.
- My employer demands a certain heart rate when I'm on the job.
- Got a little present for you.
- They really are a fencing team.
- Why don't you just come here?
- I'll do this clean.
- Easy.
- No pain.
- Please be in the Intersect.
- En garde.
- Point.
- What's the matter with you?
- You know you're gonna die.
- You missed.
- A lot.
- Chuck, Chuck, what's happening?
- Hey, guys, I'm still alive, and my first solo mission was a success.
- Buckle up, Buy More-ians, it's gonna be a bumpy ride.
- Meet my new lieutenant... Assistant Manager, John Casey.
- You guys know John from appliances.
- Or maybe you remember him from the volleyball incident at last year's employee picnic.
- Either way, for those of you who are willing to abandon the plot to sabotage me in my assistant managership, you're free to go.
- Well, well, well, lookie what we have here.
- This is a no-smoking store.
- Thanks, Jeff.
- Do you know what, my lieutenant has the right to smoke a cigar if he wants.
- Or he can put it out.
- Mr. Casey.
- Anyone else want to leave?
- Anything you got to say, big guy?
- Lester says this... isn't over.
- Does he?
- And I know it sounds outrageous, but the Eiffel Tower's most amazing engineering feat is the elevator itself...
- And with that, I realize I'm the most boring person in the world.
- No, no, that was an amazing story.
- And-and I really like your model.
- Thanks.
- It was a... gift from my dad.
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.
- Have you ever been to Paris, Chuck?
- Of course.
- That's a...
- No, I haven't.
- It's just that you talked about it with such wonder, like someone who's always wanted to go.
- No one in first class ever wants to do anything that badly.
- You're different; you stand out.
- Thank you.
- This is all kind of new to me.
- I think I just wanted to fit in, you know?
- Why? What's your secret, Chuck?
- Uh, the truth is, I work at the Buy More in Burbank.
- You know, the...
- Uh, in the Nerd Herd department.
- I did a home theater install at this guy's house in LA, and, uh, he liked it so much that he wanted me to do the same thing in his home in Paris.
- So here I am.
- His ticket... I'm just along for the ride.
- I don't really belong in Paris, or... first class, for that matter.
- That's not true.
- Do you want to know my secret?
- Is it scary?
- No. Um...
- I just got fired from my job.
- I thought I'd actually convinced them to let me stay, but...
- I am now officially flying to Paris to empty out my office.
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
- Meeting you almost makes it worth it.
- Mama?
- Uh-uh-uh, you're not here, you're still sleeping.
- You're still in bed.
- Just relax.
- Just watch the red dot.
- This is your boss.
- Morgan is your boss.
- Morgan is your boss.
- Morgan is your boss.
- Morgan is my boss.
- Morgan is Lester's boss.
- Morgan is Lester's boss.
- That's right.
- You're happy that Morgan is your boss.
- Wait.
- This Morgan person is real?
- This store you work in, it actually exists?
- Yeah, oh, yeah. Yes to both of those things.
- Although, even personally, I have quite often wondered if the Buy More was really an insane asylum, but yeah.
- What is it?
- Uh...
- Uh, that-that, uh, that drink, I don't remember... ordering it.
- It just kind of appeared out of nowhere.
- A... and you drank it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Just tasted a little... a little funny.
- Yeah, you look like you've been poisoned.
- That's crazy.
- Chuck? Is something wrong?
- I've just been poisoned!
- Someone just poisoned me!
- I think it was Hugo. I tied him up downstairs in the cargo hold, but somehow he escaped!
- What did it taste like?
- It was very complex.
- It had a strong nose, with hints of apple, and then a very sour finish.
- He's right, it's poison.
- Chuck, you have to throw up.
- That's disgusting.
- Just do it right now.
- Busy!
- It's Hugo... He is coming for me.
- Sir, are you okay?
- Do you need any help?
- Sorry, Mexican food.
- You do not want to come in here.
- Scream, and you're dead.
- Chuck?
- I am so writing a letter to the airline about this.
- Shut up. There's only one antidote for that poison, and I have it.
- Now, right now, you're feeling queasy.
- In an hour, you'll be in more pain than you could possibly imagine.
- Okay, fine. What do you want?
- The key! Now!
- What key?
- Ooh! Oh, th... the key.
- You have it; I want it.
- Give it to me.
- And don't lie.
- I'll k\*ll you right here.
- I have the key, but I don't have it on me... I hid it down in the cargo hold.
- Go on.
- Oh.
- Hi.
- Ooh!
- Isn't poisoning me enough?
- Now, where's the key?
- Antidote first.
- Is this your first mission?
- Maybe.
- You led my agent into a mission with two ring operatives?
- He's going to make it.
- How?
- Watch.
- This is Blackbriar to Crystal Palace.
- Do you have me, Palace?
- Copy that. I need to initiate an executive office override.
- Put sentry satellite into inverse orbit over Millennium Atlantic flight 3923.
- Standing by for 3923...
- What are you doing?
- Four years ago, we launched a satellite designed to take control of enemy fighters.
- Surprisingly, the thing actually works.
- You're a pilot, right?
- You're gonna take control of that plane?
- That's a 747.
- I hope you're a quick learner... Captain Walker.
- Call Chuck.
- All right, I work for the CIA, okay?
- And that's my boss.
- I cannot give up the key without his authorization first.
- Answer it. On speaker.
- Hi, guys.
- If you're wondering, I'm doing just dandy.
- Aside from being captured, poisoned and repeatedly socked in the gut!
- I have your agent.
- Order him to give me the key.
- Who is this?
- I work for a third party, and my employer doesn't tolerate failure.
- Now, your man...
- Oh, Chuck. Seat 2B.
- ... Chuck here will be dead in an hour.
- But I'm in a rush, so he gives me the key or I k\*ll him now.
- Okay.
- O... okay?
- Did he just say... Did you just say... ?
- I think you meant to say, "Please don't k\*ll my good friend Chuck".
- What type of poison are you using?
- I'm not bluffing. This is a cyanide hybrid.
- Cyanide hybrid!
- You've used it before in Berlin.
- What?
- Serena, you used that same poison to take out the Syrian ambassador, and I know you work for the ring.
- How do you know this?
- Don't worry about that.
- Do what I say. Give my agent the antidote, and I'll let you and your gorillas slide on this one.
- Who are you?
- Serena, you can do this.
- Let him go.
- I can't. You know my employer.
- Your agent is alone and he's going to die.
- No, my people are never alone. Now.
- Disengaging yaw damper.
- Inducing negative Gs.
- We've run into a patch of turbulence.
- Please return to your seats right now.
- You sh\*t a g\*n on a plane? ! Are you crazy? !
- Sarah, level off the plane now!
- Got it.
- Ah...
- Ah!
- Hey, I'm alive and I have the key.
- Unfortunately, I did not get to use my nunchakus.
- This is Blackbriar to Crystal Palace.
- Disable link on my mark.
- Copy that.
- Three, two, one. Break.
- Uplink terminated.
- Thank you, Palace.
- Well, the flight crew will never even know we were there.
- Just another day in the office.
- I do everything I can to protect my people.
- I lost one spy.
- It was my fault.
- And it will never happen again.
- Why were you in Lisbon?
- I went to bury Bryce, my partner.
- He wanted his ashes there.
- Lisbon was our first mission.
- I knew I wasn't supposed to leave, but I promised him that I would take care of it, so I did.
- If you want me out, just tell Beckman and she will reassign me.
- Why would I do that?
- I need you.
- I just had to be sure that the ring hadn't gotten to you already.
- And now do you believe me?
- Every word, Sarah.
- How are you feeling?
- Um, much better, thanks.
- Sorry about that whole airsickness episode.
- It wasn't my finest hour.
- No, it's okay.
- Chuck, I'm gonna be here for a couple of days clearing things up.
- I would love it if I could show off the Eiffel Tower to you.
- What do you say?
- Absolutely. That would be amazing.
- Great.
- Oh.
- Hello.
- Chuck, our Paris station is taking over custody of the ring operatives.
- They send their compliments.
- Fantastic. That is great news.
- Another thing, stay on the plane. We need that key back in Burbank ASAP.
- Uh...
- Really? I can't... ?
- Mission's over, Chuck. Time to come home.
- What is it?
- Um, the install job I was gonna do here in Paris has been canceled, so Buy More needs me back immediately.
- I have to stay on the plane.
- What about Paris?
- Don't worry about it. It's... it's no big deal.
- I'll get back here eventually.
- And, uh, and furthermore, uh...
- Hannah, if, um, if you ever find yourself in Burbank, and I don't know what the chances of you finding yourself in Burbank are, but if you do find yourself in Burbank, and you're still without a job, my assistant manager owes me about a million-and-a-half favors.
- Although, I have to warn you, you will be terribly overqualified for the job.
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.
- It was a pleasure to meet you, Hannah.
- It was great to meet you, too, Chuck.
- Bye.
- Au revoir.
- Lester, dude, what are we going to do?
- About Morgan and his new goon?
- Morgan?
- Yeah. How are we gonna get back at him?
- Morgan Grimes is the kindest, warmest, most understanding human being I've ever known in my life.
- Whoa, that is too cool.
- How did you do that?
- Don't ask. Plausible deniability.
- Plausible deniability.
- Yeah, of course, of course.
- Your key, sir.
- Very good, Chuck. Your first solo mission.
- I am impressed.
- Well, thank you, but I would be dead if it wasn't for you guys.
- All right, who wants to see if this key works?
- What is it, a w\*apon?
- No, it's a lockbox.
- Belonged to a spy I had inside the ring.
- It's all of the intel the agent had.
- With this we might stand a chance.
- And one of our best didn't die in vain.
- What's in the envelope, Shaw?
- She was k\*ll by a ring agent five years ago.
- Her name was Evelyn Shaw.
- Eve.
- We both made the same mistake, Sarah.
- We fell in love with spies.
- What's with the looks?
- He gave me a raise.
- Inflation, buddy. See what happens when you go away for a two-day install?
- Everything changes.
- Ah, I don't know.
- Sometimes I think everything just stays the same.
- But maybe that's just me.
- Chuck, what happened on the install?
- Nothing, buddy.
- Nothing at all.
- Bored now.
