# Chuck Versus the Other Guy

- Hi, I'm Chuck. Here's a few things you might need to know.
- You're not the same guy that I fell for.
- How am I not the same guy?
- You k\*ll somebody, Chuck.
- He didn't k\*ll the mole. What?
- I did. It's time you learned the truth about your wife's m\*rder.
- No!
- If the Ring played him this video...
- Oh, my God, General, where is Sarah now?
- I believe she's with Agent Shaw.
- Daniel, where are you taking us?
- To settle an old score.
- Okay, just give me 20 seconds. Are you sure about this?
- NSA picked up the Director's signal.
- This is his broadcast point.
- If they're right, Sarah, the Ring's most senior operative is behind that door.
- Cover me.
- Hey, buddy. Hey.
- Hey, hey, buddy. Where's Casey?
- Haven't seen him. I have been thinking about this whole unofficial member of Operation Bartowski and I'd like to make it official.
- Yeah, you know, I'm kind of in the middle of something... Spyish?
- I know. That's my point, dude. Let me help.
- I want to be part of the team. Okay, fine.
- Help me find Casey and you're part of the team.
- Operation Bartowski? I could actually... Shh!
- Not so loud. Not so loud, right.
- It's just great news, you know, because, listen, I could be your second in command slash personal assistant. Batman needs Alfred.
- Bond needs Q.
- Chuck- hey, hey, hey. You need me.
- Morgan, I need Casey right now.
- Well, Chuck, per my excellent peripheral vision- which is a valuable spy k\*ll I might add- I can tell you that one John Casey is now exiting the restroom.
- Oh, thank you. Great. You're welcome.
- So I'm a spy? That's it? Official?
- Yes, you're a spy. Gotta go.
- I am a spy.
- Shaw?
- Walker k\*ll Shaw's wife?
- It was five years ago. It was her Red Test.
- Sarah didn't know. Beckman didn't know, but Shaw, he knows. Now, he and Sarah have disappeared on some mission. They're off the grid.
- They can't be raised. They're gone. Chuck, I'm not an agent.
- You shouldn't be telling me any of this.
- But you know what to do, Casey.
- Okay, Beckman told me to just sit tight.
- You and I know I can't do that.
- Sarah just activated her locator.
- She's in trouble.
- Come on, man!
- You know how I feel about her.
- Call this number.
- Request Tactical Support.
- You'll be forwarded to a Colonel Sanders.
- Don't make fun of his name.
- You want air, armor- everything.
- ♪ ♪
- ... video camera for your birthday.
- I had no idea you were going to use my present against me.
- Happy birthday.
- I love you.
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.
- All right, one more time, just so we're clear.
- We have to reacquire Agent Walker.
- Nothing can happen to her. Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- This is Team Leader. Is everything set?
- MEN Air is go.
- Mechanized is go.
- Tactical is go.
- Airborne is go.
- All right, boys, let's do this.
- ♪ ♪
- Shaw.
- I'm going first.
- Shaw.
- What is going on?
- What is this? This is my Red Test.
- Why would they have my surveillance footage from my first k\*ll?
- Just take a breath.
- This is the worst moment of my life up there on that monitor.
- I love you.
- Mine, too.
- What?
- Why? Who is she?
- Evelyn Shaw.
- I k\*ll your wife?
- You had no idea that the Ring was behind this.
- Shaw, I k\*ll your wife.
- This isn't your fault. I thought I was a good spy.
- This isn't your fault.
- Hey... it's okay.
- Chuck?
- Hi.
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Move! Move! Move!
- The perimeter's surrounded. Put your hands up!
- Down on the ground now!
- Now! Now!
- MAN What's happening in there?
- Target's secure?
- This is Team Leader.
- Cancel air support.
- Cancel tactical.
- And the t\*nk, the t\*nk!
- Cancel the t\*nk.
- Who on Earth gave you the authority to call in a full tactical as\*ault?
- I don't know what to do with you, but I know you're not ready.
- But, General, it was Sarah.
- Come on. I had to...
- You want to see the bill for your rescue mission?
- It's longer than my copy of Atlas Shrugged.
- Look, you and I both thought the worst.
- That Shaw had gone rogue.
- That he was going to... k\*ll Sarah?
- Shaw.
- Sarah.
- Listen...
- You thought I betrayed my country?
- General, Chuck's actions were those of a true spy.
- He was looking out for his partner and the Agency.
- I would have done the same myself.
- Maybe without the stealth b\*mb, but perhaps that's just me.
- Are you doing okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Thank you for saving me.
- I appreciated the t\*nk.
- General, did you check Sarah's records?
- Any clues as to who ordered her Red Test?
- I'm afraid, Sarah, Langston Graham took that secret to his grave.
- Well, okay, General, then what are we supposed to do now?
- We disband the team.
- Surely, you can't operate as an effective unit with this history.
- General, if I may?
- This isn't the first time they've used one of our own against us.
- I want to make sure it's the last.
- You're saying you can still work with Walker?
- I can.
- We both want the same thing: to capture the Director and take down the Ring.
- Are you with me?
- Can we still be a team?
- Yes.
- Great.
- Everyone's back together again.
- What is it, boy?
- My demo station don't cook by itself.
- I, uh...
- Spit it out, son.
- Is it your mama?
- It's Chuck. Is he okay?
- Jeff and Lester, I could give a damn about them. Go ahead and fire them.
- It's okay.
- Someone else?
- Who's the issue? Me.
- Me. I'm the issue.
- This is tough.
- I'm quitting.
- I found a job.
- A real job.
- You can feel proud about it?
- You're not selling your body?
- You've got to go.
- Boy...
- I... I can't show emotions like this.
- Mm-hmm. Those animals out there, they'll...
- They'll get me if I do.
- I think Morgan's dying.
- I call dibs on his locker.
- Its location is far more prestigious than my own.
- No, man. Those are tears of joy.
- Morgan's leaving. Grimes.
- Don't worry, John.
- You will always have us.
- And now, sans Morgan, we have room!
- For what?
- For you. In our crew, buddy.
- Come on. Hands in!
- You, you can let go of my hand now.
- What is it, Bartowski?
- General, if I could speak freely?
- That's not a good idea.
- As the titular member of Team Bartowski, I think that it's crazy to be putting Shaw back in the field so soon. He just found out that Sarah k\*ll his wife, okay?
- The guy's got to be an emotional train wreck right now.
- Nobody can control their feelings that well.
- Chuck, what you are seeing in Shaw is an absolute professional: something you are not.
- That's why I'm moving them out of Burbank.
- Moving who out of Burbank?
- Sarah and Shaw.
- I'm proceeding with my original plan.
- They'll head up our Ring task force in Washington.
- And what about me?
- You'll stay in Burbank until I know what to do with you.
- Wa-pshh!
- Where you going, sport?
- New job?
- It's kind of secret.
- You're going to work for Chuck.
- I'm not a moron.
- All right.
- Isn't it awesome? Can you believe it?
- Me, a spy.
- And listen, when-when General Beckman lets you come back, me and you will be spies together.
- Beckman doesn't forget a small thing like "treason. "
- And, uh...
- I'm really learning to enjoy my new life here.
- Are you kidding me?
- John, your old life was so exciting.
- The adventures, the missions, the w\*apon, the women...
- Please stop.
- Right. Got it.
- Learn to lock it down.
- Well, I'll tell you what.
- I'm glad you're okay here, you know?
- Won't be the same without you.
- But, uh... enjoy my old life.
- You, too.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Got some very exciting news.
- Are you ready? Hold onto your hat.
- I did it. I...
- What the heck is going on here?
- Oh.
- Are you mixing gaming with whiskey?
- She's leaving, man.
- Leaving with the other guy.
- No, this cannot happen.
- This cannot happen.
- I thought I stood a chance, you know? Yeah, well, just...
- Hmm-mm, hmm-mm. Okay, okay, buddy.
- Hand it over. Hmm-mm, hmm-mm. No.
- Let go. No.
- You are on the precipice of emotional ruin here.
- I'm already over the edge! No, you're not!
- Soon you're gonna start quoting liberally from the works of John Hughes.
- And then things are gonna go dark.
- Things are gonna go really dark, and I'm not gonna let that happen.
- Morgan, hand over the bottle!
- Never!
- Yes, you will.
- Make me.
- ♪ ♪
- I hope you're happy.
- She said she couldn't be with someone who didn't believe in her.
- Well, I believed in her.
- I just didn't believe in me.
- Dude, you are misquoting the line, and you are ruining Pretty in Pink for me.
- Now, just stop it.
- Put the cap back on the top of the bottle, and let's forget that this night ever happened. Okay?
- I'm really good at that, dude.
- I've forgotten entire years, man.
- What is happening?
- Hey, Sarah.
- Chuck's in a, a bit of a low spot.
- Um...
- Yeah, yeah, I see that.
- He found out that you're leaving with Shaw.
- He's also eaten an entire carton of sugar-free mint ice cream, which is only concerning, well, when you factor in the large consumption of whiskey.
- Thank you.
- Morgan, can you leave us please?
- I forgive you.
- Great, now I hate this song.
- Look, I, uh...
- I know what I look like.
- The mint ice cream sobered me up pretty good.
- Chuck, it's okay.
- No, it isn't.
- I thought I could save you.
- I thought Shaw was bad and I was gonna save you, and we were gonna be together.
- But that didn't happen.
- Shaw's a good spy.
- I get it, okay?
- I think everybody gets it.
- Shaw is amazing.
- And you two are gonna go run off together and save the world.
- And that's great news for the world.
- But earlier on in my... drunken haze...
- I realized that I hadn't asked you a question.
- Really important question that I'd like to ask you now, if that's okay.
- Just once, for the record...
- Sarah, do you love me?
- Wow. I'm, uh, I'm in my underwear.
- I'm sitting in my underwear, holding a plastic guitar.
- There's a very good chance I'm making a complete fool of myself, isn't there?
- Yes.
- I should probably put some pants on.
- No, Chuck.
- Yes.
- Wh... uh, what?
- Chuck, I fell for you a long, long time ago- after you fixed my phone and before you started defusing b\*mb with computer viruses.
- So, yes.
- Yes.
- Wait, wait.
- What about my Red Test?
- Casey told me.
- He told me that he k\*ll the mole and that you couldn't do it.
- And it was the best news that I'd ever heard because it means that you haven't changed.
- You're still Chuck.
- You're still my Chuck.
- I, uh, I will be totally cleaned up by tomorrow.
- Well, you don't have time because we have a mission.
- Shaw found the Ring headquarters.
- It's a three-man op, and you're our third.
- Mission?
- No problem.
- Morgan, what are you doing?
- Right. Where are my manners?
- We haven't even met professionally.
- Morgan Grimes.
- Agent of the CIA and an assistant to one Charles Irving Bartowski.
- Now, let's get to work here.
- You heard the lady.
- There is a mission, and you are needed.
- Let's get you some coffee.
- You okay, Chuck?
- Huh, what, me? Yeah, good. Totally cool.
- Yeah, ready to go.
- Everything is totally normal.
- All right.
- Director has his own private elevator.
- You two are gonna rappel down to it.
- When the Director leaves, grab him; I'll pull you back up.
- Cool.
- Great.
- You think he knows about us?
- Shh.
- I'm just saying...
- Okay, ready?
- Don't worry about the warehouse or Beckman, Chuck.
- I trust you completely.
- Yeah.
- Okay, Shaw, we're in.
- Hey.
- What's the matter?
- Um, I have a concern about Shaw.
- While he, yes, is a very great spy, emotionally, the guy is Swiss cheese, okay?
- Chuck, Shaw is one step closer to capturing the Director.
- And I'm sure that is all he is thinking about, so don't even worry.
- All right, Sarah, I'm accessing the elevator's controls.
- What is it? Someone heard something...
- Gentlemen.
- See! See! He knows!
- Shaw, are you okay?
- He's having a mental break. We're fish in a barrel.
- Sorry about that, guys.
- Little Ring company.
- See, I told you he wasn't trying to k\*ll us.
- All right.
- I'm opening the hatch.
- Oh, don't worry. It's a tranq g\*n.
- Okay, fine. Just sell that it's real.
- Right, of course. Ruthless spy.
- You're gonna take care of most of them though, right?
- Sarah, internal security system is detecting something moving toward the elevator.
- Looks like the Director's coming in early.
- Time to meet our bad guy.
- One word and you're dead.
- Now, this is brazen.
- That... that was four words.
- Kidnapping me in my own lift.
- Impressive.
- But there's absolutely no chance you'll get the Cipher.
- Did he just say Cipher?
- Yeah.
- What do you mean? Don't play dumb.
- You're better than that.
- We've been building our own Intersect for a year.
- You know that.
- Of course. The Cipher is the Intersect's core processor.
- Fine, so it's here. So where exactly is it?
- You won't get five feet from this door.
- My security will be on you in seconds.
- Well, that's tough because either we get the Cipher or...
- Pull out your Ring phone.
- What Ring phone?
- You mean, this Ring phone?
- Yeah, that Ring phone right there.
- Call your assistant.
- What? You know, your secretary.
- Whoever you have. Call him or her, have them bring the Cipher to you here.
- And put it on speakerphone.
- You give her one warning, and I'm gonna...
- Please. I know the drill.
- Denise.
- Sir, you asked for this.
- Also, I spoke with Operative 6.
- They'll proceed with the coup in 15 minutes.
- The Spanish Ambassador also called back with the ransom offer. He wants to close by end of day tomorrow at the latest.
- Thank you, Denise.
- And please text me when the plane lands in Barcelona.
- "Barcelona"- it's a code.
- Oh, "Barcelona's" a code? That-that's good.
- What are we supposed to do with her now? !
- Well, personally, I'd sh\*\*t her.
- Decisions, decisions.
- Shaw, what's going on?
- Just need a few more seconds. Well, we don't have seconds.
- Sorry, sir.
- One of our guys heard something strange in the elevator shaft.
- Hi, welcome to the party.
- This is getting ridiculous.
- I've got it. Here we go.
- You know it's over, right?
- What?
- This was a trap.
- For you.
- Okay, nobody move.
- We can all die here today.
- You can all die here today.
- Personally, I have dinner reservations.
- Look at me.
- Do I look like an amateur?
- No, you don't, but your partner here is a very different story.
- Not much of a spy, are you?
- I am a spy.
- Really?
- With a tranq p\*stol?
- Real g\*n too dangerous for you?
- Put it down.
- Sorry, Chuck.
- Daniel... still upset about your wife?
- You should really learn to get over that or take it out on Agent Walker here.
- She pulled the trigger.
- Go. Take the service elevator to the fifth floor, then the north stairwell.
- I'll get the Cipher.
- I'll meet you back at Castle.
- Shaw, we're not gonna leave you here.
- Sarah, go, please.
- Did he... ?
- You know, I think you're right.
- I think we should probably wait to tell him about us.
- Good work, Daniel.
- I think they bought it.
- You weren't supposed to eliminate the Director, Shaw.
- This wasn't a red op.
- I did what I had to to get my team out.
- Oh! That was a huge kick! Where did we... ?
- Where'd you get this? Where'd we get this footage?
- I tapped into the building security feed during the op.
- Wow, that's a hell of a roundhouse, buddy.
- Uh, General, I do think it's worth noting that we would all be dead if it were not for Shaw, so...
- Very well.
- General, there's also the issue of the Cipher.
- The Director said that the Ring was making a new Intersect.
- Relax. My team analyzed their Cipher and found a number of problems in the design.
- Obviously, the Ring isn't as far along as they thought.
- Looks like the Cipher's components were fabricated in France.
- That's right, Shaw.
- I need you and Sarah to follow this trail to Paris.
- We believe the Ring's design facility is there.
- We can be in the air in 30 minutes.
- Excuse me, General.
- Uh, what, what about me?
- Sorry, Chuck, you're not ready.
- We are never gonna get our chance, are we?
- Once I get back, it's all gonna happen... you and me.
- Don't worry.
- Just one more mission.
- Hey, look at you!
- Nice! I take it you and Sarah are official.
- Now, the other guy, he's out of the way?
- Well, actually, Sarah and Shaw are on their way to Paris.
- Beckman doesn't think I'm ready to be out in the field.
- But other than that, everything's fine.
- How is everything fine?
- Chuck, I quit my job so I could join you in the field.
- You did... you did what? !
- You said I was a part your team.
- That you were gonna speak to Beckman about me.
- Did you speak to Beckman about me?
- Of course you didn't. No, why would you?
- I'm not a spy. I'm an idiot.
- No, no, you're not an idiot.
- I gave up a management position in a down economy.
- Look, I'm sorry, buddy, okay? I'm gonna talk to Beckman.
- Sarah's gonna come back into town, and I will prove that we are both field-ready.
- Chuck, are you kidding me? None of that is gonna happen.
- Listen to me. Shaw's gonna get Sarah, okay?
- And you're gonna go willy-nilly, tie me up again and drink yourself into Guitar Hero oblivion.
- I may have said some unfortunate things about Shaw, but the fact of the matter is the guy's exactly what he seems: he's a hero.
- That's nice. Good for him.
- Know what else he is, dude? A stud, okay?
- And 99 times out of ten, that guy gets the girl.
- We're done here!
- Buddy, Morgan, Morgan, look, I'm not supposed to show you this, but it was so awesome, I made a copy of it.
- It'll help prove my point. Here we go.
- Okay, this is from the mission. Uh-huh.
- That is Shaw saving our butts right there.
- Wait for it. Wait for the roundhouse.
- Ah! Whoa! That's gotta hurt.
- We have a problem.
- What?
- Chuck, look at this.
- He pulls that punch.
- And that roundhouse?
- It doesn't even land.
- But he sh\*t people, Morgan! Bad people!
- Did you see bl\*od, viscera, brain matter?
- Chuck, did you see brain matter?
- Okay, listen to me.
- I have seen every Hong Kong fight film ever made, all right?
- I direct your attention to my favorite Sonny Chiba poster.
- I am the man when it comes to this.
- You have to trust me.
- I can spot a fake action sequence from a mile away.
- That's what we have here.
- But if the fight was staged, that means that Shaw is working with the Ring.
- And Sarah is with him.
- I'm uploading the fight footage to Beckman's home computer now.
- Report, Chuck.
- Uh, General, I'm so sorry about the hour, but we just figured something out.
- Something very important.
- Agent Shaw is working with the Ring.
- Chuck, how many times do we have to do this?
- General, before, I was right for the wrong reasons, but this time I'm right for the right reasons, and-and I have proof.
- Hi, there.
- What is he doing here? !
- Well, uh, first of all, sir, uh, ma'am...
- Is it "sir"? What am I doing?
- Just talk! Okay. I'd like to thank you for this opportunity.
- Stop! What are you doing there? !
- Me? I'm with him.
- I'm on Chuck's team.
- Oh, no. No, you're not because Chuck's not on his own team anymore.
- I want you both out of Castle in five minutes!
- Chuck, you are suspended!
- No! No, no, General!
- Come on! She's blocking my call.
- Well, okay, my time as a spy was pretty exciting.
- A bit brief, you know?
- You're still a spy.
- How's that, dude?
- Because right now I need a team, and you're all I've got, buddy, okay? CIA or no CIA.
- We need to save Sarah.
- Just the two of us.
- No, there is another.
- So now they're in Paris, Sarah and Shaw.
- And Shaw, this time for real, he is working for the Ring.
- Now, I know that you can't help me again. I know all that.
- But Sarah's gonna die without us.
- I can't do this alone.
- And I can't help you anymore. I'm not a spy.
- But you are a spy! You're the ultimate spy!
- Was, Chuck, was.
- But the man's been Buy More'd.
- That's right.
- You deluded yourself into thinking that Buy More's your life.
- But wake up, John, okay?
- 'Cause we need you to get on this plane!
- Chuck needs you to get on this plane.
- And if not, that's cool, you know, find yourself one Friday night in Jeff and Lester's crew hanging out in Woodland Hills.
- I know this because I was that guy.
- But Chuck and Sarah and you, Casey, you showed me that I could be so much more, that I'm meant for something: to be a spy.
- What about you?
- What do you have left in the t\*nk?
- What do you want to be when you grow up?
- Morgan, go to my closet and get me my suit.
- The black one.
- Is this all of it?
- This is everything I could find on Shaw.
- I can't believe this is happening.
- She could be dead, Casey.
- Focus on the mission, will ya?
- What is it? You just flashed.
- It's a mission from ten years ago.
- It has nothing to do with Sarah.
- I could flash on everything in here, and we'd still be at square one and have nothing.
- I'm stuck in the air right now and there's nothing I can do about it! Chuck, focus.
- Forget about the Intersect.
- Forget about being a spy.
- Before all of that, you were smart.
- Now we're gonna take this intel, you're gonna figure out where Sarah is.
- It's what you have to do.
- Where are you, Sarah?
- Something is off.
- What is it?
- Why did you bring me here?
- What do you mean?
- You led me here.
- Come on. This is where I sh\*t her.
- Is this some kind of a trap?
- Sarah... you k\*ll my wife.
- Did you really think that I'd be okay with that?
- But you said that...
- I told you a lot of things to get you here.
- The g\*n's getting heavy, isn't it?
- You know, you could hurt someone with this.
- There's a little cafe around the corner.
- Let's sit down, discuss the details.
- Just relax. It's all over now.
- The drug is a special toxin.
- It won't k\*ll you.
- It simply immobilizes your nervous system.
- I want you to see what's gonna happen next.
- I need you to understand why I'm doing this.
- So, Sarah, I see you've met my newest Ring agent.
- Why?
- Well, I offered Daniel the chance to not only avenge his wife's death, but to destroy the very institution that ordered her m\*rder: your CIA.
- The CIA believed that Eve had been turned by us.
- Your boss Langston Graham assigned you to k\*ll her.
- You did what you were told.
- I'm going to send a message to the CIA that they betrayed the wrong man.
- Very well put, Daniel.
- They need to know what they did to me.
- They need to feel the pain that I felt.
- And that... is why I have to k\*ll you.
- On that note, do you have it with you?
- The report details the problems with your Cipher.
- The technical data should help your scientists complete the new Intersect.
- Thank you, Daniel.
- We'll be in touch.
- Do you need us to, uh... ? No.
- I want to show her the river.
- It's... beautiful at night.
- Well, good night, then.
- Good-bye, Sarah.
- Almost time to go.
- How'd you find me?
- I've read your file... your wife's, every mission you've been on, every paper you wrote at West Point, every travel report.
- You come here once a year in memory of your wife's death.
- It made morbid sense that you'd want Sarah to see it, too.
- Smart. Very smart.
- You're under arrest.
- Now, stand up.
- Less smart, Chuck.
- You should pull the trigger. Now.
- k\*ll me.
- I wouldn't do that.
- I see you brought Casey.
- Oh, yes, I did... and he's currently taking care of your new Director.
- And you've got me?
- Stand... up.
- I guess the g\*n was his idea.
- Good.
- No, Shaw, don't do this.
- You can't flash, can you?
- Those emotions get you into trouble.
- Now, you just stay here.
- I don't want to hurt you.
- None of this was your fault.
- I haven't told them your secret.
- But if you follow me...
- I will k\*ll you.
