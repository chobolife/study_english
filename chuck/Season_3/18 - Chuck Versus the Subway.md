# Chuck Versus the Subway

- Hey, I'm Chuck. Here's a couple of things you might need to know or maybe you just forgot.
- I had a fianc√©e.
- Now, she thinks I'm dead.
- Alex.
- You got a daughter, Casey.
- Do you think Ellie's happy in your marriage?
- Of course.
- Why? Did she say something?
- This is about your father, Ellie.
- There are some very bad people looking for him, including a man named John Casey.
- I knew it! You downloaded the Intersect 2. 0.
- The Intersect... It can have a negative affect on the brain.
- Your dreams are all proof of stress likely leading to serious mental deterioration.
- So, what did you want to tell me? Is it about the doctor?
- He said that... I'm fine.
- Wait a minute, you dreamt Shaw was alive?
- Chuck, you saw him die.
- I call it the Governor.
- It governs my neural network and helps control the power of the Intersect.
- Could something like that work for the 2. 0?
- It will. I'm going to make you one.
- So, how's everything, uh, how's everything coming?
- Same as the last time you asked me.
- Can I get you anything, like a, like a juice?
- Or coffee?
- Maybe a breakfast sandwich?
- I'm fine, Charles. Just relax.
- "Relax. " That's good.
- That's... that's good.
- Dad, is this really going to work?
- This whole, this whole Governor thingy?
- I'm still alive, aren't I?
- Look, based on the schematics of my own Governor, I'm going to create a new one that'll help control the Intersect 2. 0 before...
- Before what? Before I go nuts?
- Because that's exactly what the Ring wants.
- Son, your brain is working fine so far, right? Who wouldn't be paranoid in your shoes? Your cover's blown, your secret base discovered, your dead partner and girlfriend's ex-lover was a double agent.
- Way to talk me down, Dad.
- What I, what I'm trying to say is...
- Your courage makes me very proud.
- But there's some battles you have to walk away from.
- What are you saying... Run?
- Turn my back on everyone that I care about?
- There may come a time when if you want to protect them... you have to go.
- Go where?
- Vacation.
- Dad was just saying that he thinks I might need to get out of here and take a little break.
- Well, he's right. You've been a little nervous lately.
- So, is this what you two have been working on?
- Yeah.
- Little family heirloom Dad's just sprucing up for me.
- Well, I'm sure he doesn't need you looking over his shoulder.
- You could use some fresh air.
- She's right, Charles.
- Smell the roses.
- I'd really rather not, Dad.
- Seasonal allergies... You know, runs in the family.
- Listen to the man.
- He knows what's best for you.
- Dude? You don't look so hot, buddy.
- I mean, compared to your normal level of hotness.
- Lost a little sizzle.
- I'm looking for my wife, Morgan.
- She didn't come home last night.
- You don't say?
- I do say.
- Why would I know where Ellie is?
- Why'd you think there was something wrong with our marriage?
- No reason.
- You know, I just kind of...
- Don't BS me, little man.
- If something is up with Ellie, I want to know about it now.
- Oh, boy.
- She's having an affair.
- She's cheating on you, bro.
- What? That's impossible.
- Casey intercepted an illicit phone message, and he played it for me.
- What? Ellie would never...
- Devon...
- Whoa.
- I'm sorry.
- You just called me "Devon".
- Yeah, well, this is no time for frivolity.
- I really need to see you.
- Devon thinks that I'm at the hospital. It's just, it's getting harder and harder to lie.
- I know.
- How could she do this to us?
- I need to call my wife.
- Yeah.
- I gotta get in on some of this Ellie action.
- That is why I choose not to get married.
- That's why I ward them off.
- Hey, I need to call my husband.
- It's weird, I'm not getting a signal.
- It's blocked.
- We can't have enemy operatives like John Casey tracking you here.
- He's on the loose? I thought...
- He had fled by the time our team got to your apartment.
- I have to call Chuck. I have to protect him.
- Ellie...
- We're in the process of bringing your brother in.
- You're safe here, and John Casey knows better than to show his face anytime soon.
- One apple pie and one cup of coffee.
- Black and bitter.
- Actually, I didn't order yet.
- I know. I ordered for you. It's easy.
- You always get the same thing.
- And you always sit in the same seat facing the door.
- Creature of habit. What can I say?
- What happened to your face?
- Hmm?
- Kitchen accident. It's nothing.
- Hey, how'd that, uh, criminal psych final of yours go?
- Good.
- Piece of cake. I'm all set to graduate next week.
- Oh. It's like your days of slinging pie are numbered.
- Don't worry. I'll make sure the next girl gets your order right.
- You won't even miss me, John.
- Thanks, Alex.
- All of these people, any of whom could be Ring agents.
- Oh, come on. You've got to switch off your spy mode.
- You're going to drive yourself crazy.
- Yeah, well, I've been down that road before, haven't I?
- Well, the CIA shrink said that you have nothing to worry about, remember?
- Right. Other than the Ring trying to k\*ll my father or me imagining that Shaw is still out there and trying to k\*ll me.
- Look, your father is safe.
- And not only that, but he is here with you, which is great. And Shaw?
- Shaw is dead.
- Look, I know what you went through, but you really have to start putting it behind you.
- What if I can't?
- Mmm, then there is always blueberries.
- How is this possibly suppose to make... ?
- Oh, my God, these are amazing blueberries.
- Mm-hmm. Wait till you try them with cream.
- Mm, be right back.
- What?
- Beautiful day, isn't it?
- Beautiful day, isn't it?
- Well, you have a good one.
- Thank you.
- Oh, God...
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.
- Sorry.
- Sa...
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- I must be losing my mind.
- You're sure this isn't just another one of your nutty Intersect dreams?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I am sure.
- Okay, Shaw is alive.
- It was like he was taunting me.
- We have to call Beckman.
- I already tried. Her assistant said that she's "indisposed".
- "Indisposed"?
- What is that suppose to mean?
- Th... The guy that I k\*ll is back from the dead.
- A guy who, keep in mind, is a Ring operative, who knows our covers, where we live, where Castle is.
- What station did you see him in?
- North Hollywood. Why?
- The time?
- Maybe half an hour ago.
- North or southbound?
- South.
- Any of this look familiar?
- Are you kidding? It's Bartowski running around like a chicken with its head cut off.
- Slow it down.
- Punch in.
- Right there, Dad.
- Oh, my God. Daniel.
- Uh, do we know what station he got off at?
- One sec. Let me run the facial recognition software.
- Hollywood and Western.
- Bingo. Where did he exit?
- There he is.
- What the hell is he doing?
- We need to follow Shaw and take him down.
- Yeah, that's one way of looking at it.
- The other option is, they're leading you into a trap.
- It's not like we're going in empty-handed.
- You know how I feel about this, Charles.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I do, but I don't have a choice.
- That's exactly what the Ring wants you to think.
- There's always a choice.
- What choice would that be, Dad?
- To run away? I'm not you, okay?
- I'm not going to spend the rest of my life in hiding.
- I can't leave the ones I love behind.
- Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you... ?
- ... doing here, man?
- My life is over.
- My wife has given herself to another man.
- Hey, your wife has given you a pass.
- You're now free to go out and mount whomever you want wish to.
- If he's been doing more mounting, he wouldn't be in this situation.
- You think that my wife is unfaithful to me because I'm not satisfying her?
- Son, while you're wasting your time at the gym or the hospital, your wife is at home alone, unoccupied.
- So, she hired herself a pinch hitter.
- Still can't believe that your missus is taking on new customers.
- It's my dream come true.
- Ellie is exactly like Chuck, but with lady parts.
- Okay. I'm going to go now.
- Whoa, whoa. Come on.
- That's the spirit, son.
- Show the old lady you know how to swing that bat.
- Nice work, guys... Awesome.
- What?
- No, not you, Awesome.
- That's awesome.
- General, I want to thank you in advance for your testimony.
- Now, it's my understanding that, uh, you've been in charge of the Intersect project ever since it accidentally was put into a civilian... A one Charles Bartowski.
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir. That is correct.
- Is it also correct that the project has fallen well short of its original expectations?
- Yes, sir. Also correct.
- But if I may add, Agents Bartowski, Walker and Colonel Casey have proven to be an excellent albeit unorthodox team.
- Your mission is to grab Shaw or k\*ll him, whichever's quicker.
- Hey, open sesame.
- Okay, we'll split up. Each take a floor.
- Okay.
- General Meriwether, Members of the Tribunal, you must understand,
- Agent Bartowski has in many ways exceeded expectations.
- I am not denying that the road has been long and rocky. but after three years, Charles Bartowski is poised to become the w\*apon we have always dreamed of.
- Justin, what's going on?
- We've been breached.
- It's Casey, isn't it?
- Don't worry.
- I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, Ellie.
- We can handle John Casey.
- You're supposed to be upstairs.
- Searched the whole floor. Nobody here.
- There's something wrong with this place.
- Hey, look. It's a government-grade biometric scanner.
- You'll never get through that.
- Come on. Let's go!
- Casey, this is not a Ring base.
- It's one of ours.
- We've got to go find Chuck.
- Justin...
- Justin?
- Chuck?
- Ellie? Ellie, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here? !
- You just punched a person.
- Chuck, I thought you quit kung fu in the third grade.
- I... Look, I'll explain later. Right now we have to get out of here.
- Come on.
- No, Chuck, you don't understand.
- You've been brought here for your protection.
- Justin is my CIA handler.
- CIA handler?
- You don't understand, okay?
- This guy is not CIA.
- Everyone in this building works for an evil organization.
- Security!
- Chuck, wait!
- In conclusion, General, I would stake my reputation on the success of Agent Bartowski.
- As you were saying, General Beckman?
- What the hell are you doing, Bartowski? !
- Chuck, what the hell is going on?
- Apparently, I have no idea.
- Where's my sister?
- She's being escorted back to her residence.
- What was she doing here?
- You are dismissed.
- General, what the hell is going on?
- I don't know how else to explain it, Chuck, but all our ass...
- Careers are on the line.
- The committee is here to determine if the Intersect project is a liability.
- Liability? Let me talk to them.
- Shaw is somewhere in this building.
- We saw him.
- If there is one thing you can do to protect the Intersect project, it's keep your mouth shut.
- Agents Walker, Casey and Bartowski, it's been brought to this committee's attention the Intersect is unstable, expensive, and most of all, dangerous.
- That's outrageous.
- Sit down, Chuck!
- I'm sorry, General.
- General, this is crazy.
- Provide one shred of evidence. Who said this?
- I did.
- Hello, Chuck.
- Sarah.
- Shaw?
- Ladies and gentleman, this man that stands before you is a Ring operative.
- He kidnapped me and he drugged me and he tried to k\*ll me!
- All of that is completely true, except for the k\*ll part.
- In fact, I was sanctioned by this committee.
- Why was I not apprised of this, General Meriwether?
- Continue, Agent Shaw.
- I was acting as a double agent, working within the Ring.
- That is, until Chuck sh\*t me.
- He's lying! Do not listen to a word that he says!
- I came here today to make one thing perfectly clear.
- Charles Bartowski is an American hero.
- He didn't ask for the Intersect.
- And it's not Chuck's fault that his brain is deteriorating.
- Excuse me, Agent Bartowski was given a full psychological exam, and he was cleared for all field work.
- Sarah...
- Do you want to tell her the truth or should I?
- What is he talking about, Chuck?
- Dr. Dreyfus's report.
- "The subject's mental decline"
- "is both inevitable"
- "and irreversible. "
- "Agent Bartowski's mind will soon succumb to paranoia, "
- "dementia, psychosis, possibly worse. "
- I can understand why your boyfriend didn't want to worry you.
- Sarah, I was gonna tell you.
- It's my recommendation that the Intersect project be aborted.
- Before any decisions are made, this committee needs to review the Intersect's successful missions.
- Hugo Panzer, taken out by Bartowski's team with a combination of a fencing foil, nunchuks and turbulence.
- Alexis White died while trying to elude capture from...
- Guys, Casey, Sarah...
- Zip it, Bartowski. Figure a way out later.
- No, he's, he's, he's an Intersect!
- Daniel Shaw is an Intersect!
- Sit down, Agent Bartowski!
- It's okay, General.
- I'm glad you're seeing this.
- See? He's not in control.
- I'm in complete control.
- I realize that what I'm about to do right now might come across as being some kind of insane gesture or maybe a completely insane gesture, but because I am in fact saying, and I am certain that Daniel Shaw is an Intersect, I'm just gonna have to prove it to you.
- Chuck, no!
- You're supposed to catch it!
- Guards, remove Mr. Bartowski!
- No! He's an Intersect!
- Sarah, I'm sorry.
- These proceedings are adjourned until further notice.
- We gotta get out of here.
- We walked into a trap.
- What about Chuck?
- Nothing we can do for him.
- Not after that stunt. We have to call Washington and tell them what is really going on.
- Most of Washington was in that room.
- Shaw and the Ring have taken over the CIA.
- He's got the whole chain of command eating out of his hand.
- God only knows how many Ring agents are on the inside.
- It's only a matter of time before they burn us, too.
- So, what? You're just gonna run?
- It's not just us they're gonna come after.
- They're gonna come after the people we care about.
- You coming?
- No.
- Everything I care about is inside this building.
- Good luck, Agent Walker...
- Sarah.
- Ellie.
- Devon, I need to talk to you.
- Where have you been all night?
- Okay, honey, I... I need you to listen to me really carefully... I have been keeping a secret from you, and I feel horrible about it.
- No. Stop, okay?
- I just, I don't think I can hear the words right now.
- It's my fault. It's my fault.
- I haven't been stepping up to the plate.
- Devon, I need you to be strong.
- I can be stronger. I can superset.
- I will double my workouts...
- Devon, stop it!
- Chuck is in trouble with the CIA!
- What?
- Chuck, our Chuck punched a CIA agent in the face today, and they are holding him right now.
- You mean, you haven't been cheating on me?
- What? Devon, what are you talking about?
- No. Listen to me. I think he's gonna need a lawyer.
- No, no, Chuck has been with the CIA for years.
- I'm so glad you finally know.
- What a relief it is to talk...
- You don't know.
- Oh, no, I just told you.
- You are gonna tell me everything you know right now.
- Order's up.
- Alex...
- You come here for the pie, too, Agent Casey?
- I think it's the best in town.
- Hey, guy.
- And you brought a friend.
- Table for two, please.
- Right this way.
- Sergeant Mosley, you're needed in the conference room ASAP.
- That means run.
- Follow you where, Dad?
- Chuck!
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. Enjoy.
- Pretty girl.
- So much to live for.
- Be a shame if she didn't.
- Not hungry?
- Why don't you put your hands on the table, John?
- Good.
- Mmm.
- Too much nutmeg.
- You're a smart guy, John.
- I'm sure you figured it out by now.
- You're coming with me.
- I gotta say, John, I never figured you for a dad.
- Well, I'm not a very good one.
- What are you doing? !
- I'm saving your life.
- Put me down!
- Hey! Ow!
- Chuck, wait!
- Where are you going?
- Sarah, I have to leave.
- My... my... my dad is coming.
- Oh, you can't.
- You have to stay and fight.
- If you run, they'll put a burn notice on you, and you'll be running forever.
- We have to move right now!
- You can't do this.
- If you run, there's a bull's-eye on your back.
- They will never ever stop looking for you.
- If you stay, everyone you love will be in danger.
- You have to choose who you want to protect... You or her.
- Dad, please don't leave...
- Right now, Charles!
- You have to run to protect her!
- I'm sorry, Sarah.
- I'm sorry, but if I have to choose, I will always choose to protect you.
- Sorry, Alex, but this is for your own safety.
- You have to believe I would never hurt you.
- No, just forcibly kidnap me.
- Here...
- Take it.
- This is a key to my locker at the Burbank Buy More.
- Everything inside is yours now.
- Look, Mr. Casey, if you want me to hear you, I'd step out of the car and talk so that I don't feel like my life is in jeopardy.
- Please?
- Okay.
- Alex, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, no, no...
- Wait! Come on!
- I got an "A" in my self-defense class!
- Alex...
- Alex, I'm your father.
- That's impossible!
- My father's dead. He was a w\*r hero.
- He died before I was even born.
- No, I didn't.
- Stop it.
- You were named after your dad, Alex.
- You're named after me.
- My real name's Alex Coburn.
- Please, you have to trust me.
- You have to get to your mom and disappear.
- Go, Alex.
- Run!
- CIA! John Casey, put your hands on top of your head!
- That whole Generalissimo thing?
- I was undercover on a mission.
- That's it.
- That's all I know, babe.
- Oh, and you can blame the CIA for my bachelor party.
- Stripper? She was an agent.
- Told you I didn't cheat.
- Faithful.
- I can't believe that my brother and Sarah are spies.
- How is my dad involved in all this?
- I, uh, have pockets of missing knowledge.
- I didn't want to know 'cause I didn't want to have to lie to you, babe.
- Devon, an actual legitimate answer exists as to why my father has been missing my entire life, and you didn't think to ask that question?
- Correct.
- You need to find me somebody who knows a lot more than you do right now.
- Morgan Grimes, the boy that took my pillow as his date to Junior Prom knows more about my family being spies than I do.
- Here.
- It's valerian root tea, and it'll give your brain a lovely, soothing bath.
- I don't want a soothing brain bath, Morgan. I want answers.
- Startling revelation, yeah, I know.
- Well, Chuck has been with the Company for quite a while now.
- Suffice to say all is in hand, so...
- No, Morgan, all is not in hand, okay?
- The bad guys have my brother.
- Hold on a second.
- Nobody said anything about bad guys.
- What bad guys? The Ring?
- What?
- The Ring... A nefarious criminal organization hell-bent on world domination.
- All I know is that Justin told me that John Casey is a double agent.
- And he's here trying to gather information about my dad, but if Chuck is an agent, too, then-then maybe Casey lied to him and turned him somehow?
- Our Eagle Scout Chuck turned to the dark side?
- No, not gonna happen. And any suggestions that Colonel Jonathan Casey's character's in question, well, I would stake my entire... albeit. . Okay, thin reputation on the fact that he is Uncle Sam's most faithful servant.
- Fine. Then one of you geniuses explain to me why the CIA is holding my brother against his will.
- I don't know, but I will find out.
- You wanted to see me... sir?
- I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you you looked great, Walker.
- Love suits you, I guess.
- Shut up, Shaw.
- This is crap and you know it.
- Only two people know what happened that day in Paris.
- It's your word against mine.
- Chuck saw what happened.
- We all know that you tried to k\*ll me.
- But Chuck has become an unreliable witness.
- His mind has been compromised by the Intersect.
- And now that he's escaped, he seems so guilty.
- I'm sorry that you had to learn about his mental deterioration in such a public forum.
- Sad that he never told you in a more intimate setting...
- Sam.
- You're gonna put your hands up and you're gonna walk out that door and you're gonna tell the generals exactly what happened in Paris.
- So move it.
- I knew you'd bite.
- Drop it, Agent Walker!
- Arrest her. She's gone rogue.
- It's a shame.
- I remember when nothing affected you.
- Now you're as emotional as your boyfriend.
- Sarah and Casey will know how to help Chuck, okay?
- You just go check the dojo.
- There's a dojo?
- General Beckman?
- Where's Bartowski?
- I'd hoped to find him in Castle.
- I think there's been some sort of mix-up. Chuck is being held by the CIA. Maybe you could actually help clear this up.
- This is great. General Beckman, open the door.
- General, what's happening?
- Open the door right now!
- They're shutting down the entire Intersect project, including myself.
- They apprehended Colonel Casey.
- Agent Walker is in custody.
- Bartowski escaped this facility... He is a wanted man.
- I need you to find him.
- As much as it pains me to admit, you are our only hope!
- You are our only hope!
- Get your hands off me!
- Dude, did she mean you or me?
- Finished it.
- Your Governor.
- It will activate immediately.
- Better?
- Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.
- Cell? That's not off the grid, Charles.
- Dad, it's, it's Morgan. I never got a chance to say good-bye to him.
- Hey, buddy, listen, I gotta go away.
- I gotta go on a trip with my dad, and, and I could be gone for a really long time.
- Yeah, well, stop. Sarah's in CIA custody.
- Casey has been taken. I think they got Beckman, too.
- What? When did this happen? What? Wait. Dad!
- Dad! Dad, we have to go back.
- Shaw has got Sarah!
- And that's no accident!
- He doesn't want her... He's trying to trap you.
- He's after this.
- I'm your father... You cannot ask me.
- Please do not ask me to put my own son in jeopardy.
- I can't just walk away, Dad!
- Why did you come back this time?
- You came back because you wanted to protect Ellie and me.
- Because you knew no matter how far you ran, you could never live with yourself if something happened to somebody that you loved.
- If we do this... we gotta be smart.
- Not think emotional!
- We can do this.
- We're Bartowskis.
- Ellie.
- Chuck, I thought that the CIA still had you.
- I wish I had time to explain.
- You know what, Chuck?
- It takes just as long to say that as to tell me what the hell is going on.
- We need your help.
- Who's we, Chuck? The government?
- The answer is no.
- No, we need your help.
- Dad? I thought that you left.
- El, I know you got a lot of questions, but right now you have the answers that we need.
- This is it.
- This is where I would meet Justin.
- This is our rendezvous point.
- There's got to be more to it, okay?
- Shaw has to have another location.
- This can't be a dead end.
- What are you two whispering about?
- No more secrets.
- May... maybe you're forgetting something.
- Walk us through what would happen when you met Justin.
- I don't know, Dad, this is it.
- I would, I would sit here on this bench and we would talk.
- And then he'd get up, he'd leave.
- He'd go over there.
- Through that door.
- The subway again.
- Hey, we need you to stay here, okay?
- You just stay right here on this bench.
- If we're not back in 20 minutes, run.
- Dad, I need to hear you say it.
- I need to know that there's a reason that you left us.
- It's a long story.
- I want to tell you everything, but I gotta, I gotta take care of this first, okay?
- This is the last time I'm gonna walk away from you.
- I promise.
- I love you, baby.
- You're not gonna get away with this, Shaw.
- Yes, I will.
- Love-soaked Bartowski will try to come save you, and this time I'll be ready for him and his father.
- Mu-ha-ha.
- Over here. Over here.
- Dad...
- This control panel was manufactured by McTiernan Industries.
- It's a Ring subsidiary.
- Fake wall.
- Aces, Charles.
- All right.
- Shaw, Bartowski's infiltrated the base.
- Of course he did.
- Why won't your boyfriend ever think with an organ besides his heart?
- No, sir, not this one.
- Bartowski and his father found the other base, the Ring base.
- Triggered the silent alarm.
- Damn it.
- Hmm. Don't know when it happened, but our boy became a man.
- Bartowski's a spy.
- Picked a good one, Walker...
- Finally.
- Oh, my God.
- Dad, this is what I've been having dreams about.
- Dr. Kowambe's medical experiments...
- Cellular regeneration.
- It's identical. They did it.
- I can't believe the Ring built one.
- They must have saved Shaw's life, and then... and then turned him into an Intersect.
- I was right.
- Dad, the lab is all the proof that we need.
- It'll vindicate my team, Shaw will be exposed.
- Exposed? Exposed as what, uh, the Intersect?
- I see you got a fancy new watch there, Chuck.
- Do you mind if I try it on?
- Why don't you come over here and take it from me?
- Actually, I think I'll have my friend grab it for me.
- I don't need a watch to b\*at you, Shaw.
- Come on. Aren't you a little curious?
- I know I am.
- Don't you want to know how your Intersect stacks up against mine?
- You're right, Chuck.
- The fight will be incredible.
- We're totally equal now.
- Nothing separates us.
- Though... there's one thing that is different.
- You can't function when your emotions have been compromised.
- Don't worry about that.
- I've never been more calm.
- Really?
- How you feeling now?
- Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!
- Dad, hey, hey, hey, hang on! Hang on!
- Hang on! Stay with me! Stay with me!
- You're gonna be okay, okay? I promise.
- You're special, son.
- Always remember... you're special.
- Check out the fresh fish.
- Wait here.
- Hello, miss.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I was wondering if I could service you in some way.
- Yes, I guess. Um... could you tell me where I could find John Casey's locker?
- What exactly is your relationship to Mr. Casey?
- If I may be so bold.
- He's my... friend, and he asked me to get something out of his locker.
- He gave me his key.
- That doesn't look like one of our keys.
- Shh!
- Maybe you're talking about a different John Casey.
- Ours doesn't really have any friends.
- Thank you, guys. I'll take it from here.
- Morgan Grimes, assistant manager.
- Hi. Alex.
- Alex, take a walk with me?
- Did you say that belongs to John Casey?
- Yes. Um, he does work here, right?
- Of course he does. Yeah, yeah.
- Who do you work for?
- It's okay... You can tell me.
- I'm on the inside.
- Um, the Pie Shack in Silverlake.
- Yeah, okay. Come on.
- Lady, please, I have a very high level of clearance, okay?
- Listen, I can't let you walk back there, have access to John Casey's locker without knowing what's going on.
- I'm sorry. My hands are tied.
- I don't know what's going on.
- All I know is that this customer John kidnaps me, and then he tells me that he's my father, and now there's men chasing us.
- And I'm sorry. I know that I don't really know you.
- I'm just a little confused right now.
- No, no, that's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you upset.
- Look, miss, I promise you this...
- If John Casey said he's your father, then it's the truth.
- I trust that man with my life.
- You have nothing to be afraid of.
- Not if he's your father.
- And in fact, this store's as safe as anywhere, provided you stay away from those two.
- Yeah? Let's go see what's in that locker, all right? Are you okay? Yeah?
- This isn't a Buy More key, so I'll have to use mine.
- Assistant manager.
- That's why I have this.
- So you know.
- Okay. Avid reader.
- Oh, my. Whoa!
- How long it's been in there. Yeah.
- Oh, check it out.
- That's gonna work.
- Oh, actually, you might want to stand back.
- This could explode.
- Ooh... Okay.
- He said this is for you?
- Yeah. What is it?
- He must have been saving for, like, ever. We don't pay that much here.
- Morgan, Ellie called.
- We need to talk.
- Yeah, sh\*\*t, buddy. Whatever you got to say, you can say in front of her.
- She's one of us.
- Not this.
- Try not to spend it all in one place.
- Chuck, what happened?
- Are you okay?
- Where's your dad?
- I'm sorry, guys.
- Shaw has won.
- Oh, my God.
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry, buddy, we'll get Shaw.
- No, we won't.
- Love the new defeatist attitude, Chuck.
- Suits you.
- We'll be leaving momentarily for the CIA detention facility.
- These people won't be seeing the light of day for some time.
- Enjoy this ride together... Bond.
- Share all the w\*r stories... because as soon as the truck stops, so do your lives.
- We'll figure something out.
- It's over.
- There is no one left to save us.
- I'm following them now.
- Are you ready?
- We're ready.
- I'm warning you, Ellie, if we do this, there is no turning back... Our lives are changed forever.
- I'm asking one final time.
- Are you sure this is what you want?
- Yes.
- Let's do this.
