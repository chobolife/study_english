# Chuck Versus the Living Dead

- Hi, I'm Chuck. Here's a few things you might need to know.
- Your dreams are also proof of stress the Intersect puts on your brain, likely leading to serious mental deterioration.
- Shaw, you're not bleeding anymore.
- That's right, Chuck, I'm not.
- What does that mean?
- It means I'm still alive.
- You work for the CIA?
- This is about your father.
- There are some very bad people looking for him, including a man named John Casey.
- Last time he left, he made sure that I had a way to contact him.
- Justin.
- Ellie, hey.
- Hey, I contacted my dad.
- Can we meet?
- Yeah, same place as last time, okay?
- Okay, I'll be there in ten minutes.
- Hey.
- Morgan, hey, buddy.
- Listen, I had another dream last night.
- It was about Shaw.
- No, I haven't told Sarah yet.
- Yes, I realize that honesty is important in a relationship.
- Who do you think I am?
- Listen, just meet me at the Buy More in, like, ten or 15.
- Okay?
- Whose relationship are you talking about?
- Huh?
- Uh... Morgan's, Morgan's.
- Yeah, Morgan and Anna, the past...
- He's just been really tore up about her lately, so...
- Oh, I thought he rejected her recently.
- He did, he did, he did, but the heart is a... is a very, it's...
- The heart is a very complicated muscle.
- Have I told you how beautiful you look this morning?
- I mean, just... Aah!
- Really, and you smell... fantastic, too.
- Oh, hey, maybe that was just the Pop-Tart.
- I got to go, bye.
- Bye.
- Wait, wait,  you dreamt Shaw was alive?
- Chuck, you saw him die, though.
- You checked for a pulse, right?
- Well, he fell into a river.
- He fell into a river? ! Of course Shaw's alive!
- Haven't you ever seen a John Carpenter movie?
- Buddy, are you going to help me or what?
- I can't tell Sarah until I'm absolutely sure because she has...
- History with the man.
- I know, I'm aware.
- Chuck, the thing is if he's alive, then he knows everything about her and he knows everything about you, everything about me... Where I work, where I live, what I eat, shower...
- Hey, buddy, hey, yo, Morgan.
- This is why we are going to find him and figure out what he's up to, okay, but first I need to take care of a few things here.
- Remember, though, this is between you and I.
- Stay between me and you.
- Okay, no problem, absolutely.
- Listen, do me a favor.
- Before you go, can you key me into Castle?
- I left something down there.
- Look, if you're really afraid of Shaw, I'll let you down there for a little while.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, you are a lifesaver, sir, literally.
- Yeah, good, okay, fine, just-just don't touch anything.
- Okay?
- All right.
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Good, good, good, good.
- Yes, oh, baby.
- Come on.
- Morgan.
- What are you doing here?
- Is Chuck up to something?
- I don't know, you tell me.
- You'd know better than I would.
- Hey, have you seen, uh, where they keep the bulletproof pants?
- You know, Morgan, you and I...
- We, uh, we never talk, really.
- Yeah, well, talking's a bit overrated.
- Plus, we don't have a lot in common, although I'd like to get to know you better.
- I mean, I don't feel like there's...
- Sit.
- Okay.
- You're going to tell me exactly what's going on and you're going to do it right now.
- Reviewing pictures of people you k*ll?
- I do that myself from time to time.
- No.
- Chuck.
- Chuck, we've got a problem, bro.
- Sarah knows about Shaw.
- Yeah, yeah, I broke, man.
- Okay, y... your lady's really intimidating.
- You know, I tried to make eye contact, but she just kind of kept pulling me in with this... this gaze.
- Morgan, how could you poss... W... what is, what... ?
- Is that a bulletproof vest?
- No, is that a bulletproof tie?
- I don't...
- I don't know what...
- Give me a break.
- That's my dad.
- Why is my dad here?
- What's the problem?
- He thinks I quit the CIA the night of Ellie's wedding.
- He does not know that I downloaded the Intersect 2. 0.
- W-w-w... wait, wait, you didn't tell him?
- Well, he spent so much time getting the damn thing out of my ad.
- Why would I tell him that? Mush, mush, mush, mush.
- Hi, hey, Dad, hi.
- How are you?
- What, uh, what are you... what are you doing here?
- Your sister contacted me.
- I wanted to check with you and make sure that everything was okay.
- Is that... ?
- Is that John Casey?
- That is John Casey.
- Of course, yeah, you know that he works here.
- Why? He's an NSA Agent, and if the Intersect project was disbanded, why would he... ?
- Shaw?
- Sarah, you remember my father.
- Oh, hi, Mr. Bartowski.
- I... it's great to see you.
- Why is your handler here?
- Handler... No.
- Oh, you've been out of the loop, so I can't expect you to know this, but... but Sarah and I are boyfriend and girlfriend now.
- Hi, sweetie.
- Tell me that you're not in the CIA anymore.
- Tell me that you quit.
- Dad, the Intersect is out of my head.
- I've moved on.
- I can assure you... We can assure you... that I am no longer a spy.
- You know me, I wouldn't lie.
- This is incredible.
- From the outside it looks like a regular office building.
- Well, that's the point.
- We're the CIA.
- Nothing's what it seems.
- Right this way.
- Okay.
- So you were able to contact your dad?
- You could say that.
- He's, uh, he's a little neurotic.
- A coded message in the classified section is his way of getting in touch with me.
- Perfect.
- So, once he tells you where he lives, we'll be able to protect him and you can tell him everything.
- What about John Casey?
- If he's a double agent...
- Ellie, he's been living in your building for three years, just observing.
- There's no reason to think that'll change now.
- But... this may put your mind at ease.
- That's a speaker.
- I don't understand.
- Like I said, nothing's what it seems.
- It's not really a speaker.
- It'll protect you.
- It'll block all of Agent Casey's audio and visual reads on the courtyard, and, Ellie, if you ever feel nervous, even for a second, just call me.
- You know you can trust me, right?
- I do.
- I think you should tell your dad the truth.
- I mean, you need to be honest with the people that you love, and that goes for me, too.
- I know, I know, Sarah, I'm sorry.
- I wanted to tell you about Shaw, but it was just a dream, and I... and I wanted to be sure before I worried you.
- But if you dreamt that Shaw was alive, then you dreamt it for a reason.
- I mean, the doctor said that you're healthy and that your dreams could be as accurate as your flashes.
- Right?
- Ye... Uh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
- Let's hope so.
- I'm not letting you go to Beckman till we know for sure.
- I ran a scan on all of Shaw's known aliases.
- No activity since Paris.
- I think our best sh*t at finding him is Walker.
- Why?
- W... why?
- She has an... intimate knowledge of the target.
- I think "intimate" is a... is a bit of a... bit of a stretch.
- If Walker goes through all the places she went with Shaw, all the things they did, maybe you'll flash on something that leads to him.
- Would you be okay with that, Chuck?
- Of course. Of course.
- Why wouldn't I be?
- So, what exactly did you and Shaw do when you were in DC?
- Casey...
- They were in and out of meetings all day, every day.
- I mean, the trip was purely spy-related.
- All business, no pleasure.
- Well, Walker, I have here a receipt from a Waterfront Restaurant named Le Jardin.
- Two chef's tasting menus, couple of nice bottles of Pinot...
- Doesn't sound like business to me.
- After our couples massage, he took me to Tiffany's.
- Did he buy you anything?
- Please.
- Everybody knows that you go to Tiffany's to browse, not buy.
- Are those new earrings, Agent Walker?
- Okay, so, on March 22, you and Shaw were off... Grid the whole day.
- What exactly were you doing?
- Objection. Relevance?
- What was so compelling that you didn't check in?
- We spent the day in his loft downtown, okay, at the Hoff Building.
- Mm-hmm.
- Was it the penthouse?
- Yes.
- Did you flash?
- Shaw ordered the CIA to construct a TR-15 safe in his penthouse.
- Whatever he's hiding in there could lead us to him.
- Looks like we're going to get to see Shaw's bachelor pad, although for some of us, it won't be the first time.

- * Not tough... *
- Hey.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Please, stop.
- Awkward.
- And cruel, but not incorrect, because you are not playing from your soul.
- You're soulless in Seattle.
- That's quite a wad of cash you hustled on Buy More property.
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. This is our dream.
- We're on break. You can't touch us.
- I don't want to touch you.
- I want to help you.
- In case you forgot, I know a thing or two about management.
- You're too good to be playing outside a chain electronics store.
- If I was your manager, you might be playing inside a chain electronics store.
- Yeah, we've already played the Buy More.
- We don't need you.
- I'm listening.
- What?
- Having a manager means having respect.
- How many times do I have to tell you? Art: good.
- Commercialism: bad, evil, weird... chubby.
- But you know what? I'm... I'm tired of it.
- You want his empty words and his razzmatazz wordplay, you take it. You take it, and you go solo, and you see how that works out for you.
- Just try and stop me from walking away.
- Just try and stop me.
- You just try.
- You try and stop me from...
- You're not going to even... ?
- That's what... You know what, fine.
- But I'm ing to take something with me that you can never have back.
- The 'Ster!
- As in Jeffster!
- Take the...
- Dad.
- What is going on?
- How did you get in here?
- Ellie, hi.
- Hi.
- Dad, I told you that I wanted to come to you.
- You shouldn't...
- What are you doing here?
- Why do my children always ask me that?
- You're my daughter.
- Of course, I'm going to come to you.
- Yeah, but...
- And this is safer.
- Okay? I-I-I... I thought you'd be happy.
- I am. I'm happy. I'm happy.
- I'm just... I'm surprised.
- In a good way.
- Oh.
- Good.
- Shaw was a part of our team for months.
- He knows everything... All of our weaknesses... . including this place.
- I'm worried he's going to come after Ellie.
- We don't know what he wants.
- Exactly.
- Which is why I need your help.
- I need you to look after her for me, make sure she's okay.
- Until we know what Shaw wants, Ellie Bartowski has a second shadow.
- No.
- No, you were five, and-and... and you refused to get out of the car for school unless you were wearing the Hawkman costume that Ellie made.
- It's true.
- I think... I think I still have that Thanagarian helmet, actually.
- Dad, how do you even remember that?
- I... you know, I remember a lot of things.
- Uh...
- So, what do you guys want to do tonight?
- Oh, actually, you know what, I've got a... kind of a date night with Sarah.
- We're going to be staying downtown tonight.
- Sorry... It was kind of a last minute thing, so...
- Well, uh, it'll just be you and me, then.
- It'll be great.
- We can talk about whatever it is you wanted to talk about.
- Oh, no. You know what?
- This is, uh... this is the hospital.
- I... I got to go.
- I'm still tying up loose ends from that Africa trip.
- You went to Africa?
- Yeah. It's... it's such a long story.
- I'll... I'll be back soon, okay?
- Stay here.
- Justin, thank God you called.
- My dad, he just surprised me.
- He's here.
- In Echo Park?
- I thought you were getting his address.
- He just showed up. What do I do?
- John Casey's home.
- Okay. It's going to be fine.
- Meet me at Bellevue Square alone, and we'll figure out what to do about your dad.
- Okay.
- So, this last-minute trip with Sarah...
- You're not going on some sort of a mission, are you?
- Dad, we just had a really nice meal, okay?
- What's with all the spy questions?
- Because I don't know anything about your life, and I'm here, and I... I'm trying to figure out what I missed, I see one thing.
- Casey works at the Buy More.
- Sarah lives with you, and... this is an active surveillance wire.
- Okay?
- And your computer is still tapped in to the CIA mainframe.
- So, you tell me again, Charles, that you're not involved in anything dangerous, that you're... that you're not a spy.
- Okay, I will occasionally do some analysis work for the CIA. It's a desk job.
- It's a glorified paper pusher.
- Charles.
- Dad, I sit behind a desk, and I input data a couple of times a month. It's nothing dangerous.
- And this... this thing tonight with Sarah?
- Is really just a night away with my girlfriend.
- You have nothing to worry about, Dad.
- I'm just an analyst.
- Did your ears just pop?
- Hey, it's me.
- Uh, I'm here and you're not.
- I really need to see you.
- Devon thinks that I'm at the hospital.
- It's just... it's getting harder and harder to lie.
- Please call me, okay?
- So, this is Shaw's penthouse, huh?
- Yep.
- Great. I'll check over here.
- I found the safe.
- Well, where is it?
- Put these on.
- Hey.
- How do... how do you... how do you get to it?
- Oh, it's password-protected.
- We're going to be here a while.
- Well, maybe we start with something common.
- You know, birthday, pet's name... your name.
- It's Shaw.
- Go, go, go, go!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait! No.
- We need to know what Shaw wants first.
- Okay? You get the briefcase, I'll make the jump.
- Okay. Well, just be careful.
- Okay. Come on, Intersect.
- What do you got for me?
- This should be interesting.
- Shaw.
- Shaw is dead.
- Care to join him?
- Did you get him? Did you get him?
- If you... if you did, make sure and check his pulse.
- But help me first.
- Okay, hold on. I'm coming, Chuck.
- Help me first before you check his pulse. Help me.
- Sarah, he's coming back.
- He's coming back.
- Dad.
- Just an analyst, huh?
- So, this is my office.
- Pretty... pretty sleek, huh?
- Why weren't you here, sitting at one of these computers instead of dangling from a rooftop?
- Why are you still lying to me?
- Dad, it's like... it's like I told you.
- The government sees a lot of potential in me, you know, so General Beckman asked if I would work as an analyst for the CIA, and then every once in a while, I'll still go off on, you know, a little field mission.
- Could you excuse me just for one second?
- And please don't touch any of the computers.
- 'Cause I know you want to, but don't do that.
- So, the guy on the roof... Who was he?
- Couldn't get a good look at our mystery man from the building's security cam footage.
- How'd he know about the loft?
- Best guess: when you accessed the penthouse, you triggered some sort of alert.
- He was after this.
- Lockbox.
- Just like the one Evelyn Shaw had.
- Okay, well, why does Shaw have one?
- It's essentially a spy's last will and testament.
- All spies keep a record of the information they might lose if they get k*ll on a mission.
- In Shaw's case, all the information that the CIA has on the Ring.
- My bet is they're going to want this back.
- 100 bucks says he's working for them.
- And if the Ring is looking for this, then it must mean that Shaw is dead.
- "My name is Daniel Shaw, "
- "and if you are reading this, it means I'm already dead. "
- I was wrong.
- Wrong about what?
- I've heard the name, Daniel Shaw, before.
- He... he's a special agent for the CIA... A Ring expert.
- I take it that's his lockbox.
- What happened?
- That mission's over, Dad.
- No, it's never over.
- There will always be another one and another and...
- The reason a spy has to have one of those is because any mission they go on could be their last.
- For every spy, there's someone who cares about them.
- Someone who has to open that box, read that message, and mourn their loss.
- This is a bad business.
- And I don't want my family any part of it.
- Sorry I didn't make it to the square.
- It's fine. Are you okay? What happened?
- I wish I could tell you, but the most pressing issue is what to do about your father.
- Do what? John Casey's watching us like a hawk.
- That's why we've devised a new plan, but it's going to require some real spy work on your part.

- And he's bringing a reckoning with him.
- Ah. No one told you, huh?
- Shaw's dead.
- No. No. Chuck said.
- He... Bartowski's wrong.
- Oh, thank God. Thank God.
- Man, someone could have given me a heads-up here.
- I've had to pee for, like, the last four hours.
- But I'm not here for that.
- Listen, would Ellie cheat on Devon for any reason?
- John Casey, if I had the height or the willpower, I would slap you across the face right now, okay?
- No, Ellie is not a cheater.
- The only way she'd ever step out was with someone that she's known her whole life, someone she trusts.
- A childhood friend perhaps. I don't know.
- Mm-hmm. I tapped into her phone.
- She left this strange message.
- I really need to see you.
- Devon thinks that I'm at the hospital.
- It's just... I's getting harder and harder to lie.
- That's Ellie.
- Oh...
- Oh, man.
- So what's the deal?
- You've done well, John, but you're a man who lacks tact and interpersonal k*ll.
- Okay, on behalf of the family, I'll speak to the husband, all right?
- This is not gonna be fun.
- Devon, yeah, so you think Ellie's happy in your marriage?
- Of course.
- Why? Did she say something?
- No. No, not exactly, but I feel pretty confident that if there is something wrong, it's your fault.
- So, take me through an average day, and then, you talk, I find the problem.
- Okay.
- Well, most mornings, I wake up around 6:00, I pop a towel in the dryer so it's warm when she gets out of the shower.
- I'll whip her up a Belgian waffle, or, you know, goat cheese omelet.
- Something easy.
- After Ellie's daily foot rub, I'll bike to the farmer's market, pick up some fresh blueberries, or you know, whatever's in season.
- Come home, make her a smoothie.
- Organic nonfat milk, flaxseed oil.
- You know, something to give her a real midday kick start.
- Once we're in bed, post-lavender bath, I spend about 20 minutes just watching her sleep.
- She looks so peaceful.
- It's, like, what's she dreaming about, you know?
- Anyway, that's my day, give or take.
- Yeah.
- Hey, Dad.
- Is everything okay?
- I... I just keep thinking.
- Without the Intersect...
- Why would they let you go on missions?
- I mean, you're... you're... you're an ordinary guy.
- I'm not.
- I'm not an ordinary guy.
- The CIA wants me to work for them because they think I'm special.
- 'Cause they believe in me.
- You're right, Charles.
- You are special.
- I knew it.
- You downloaded the Intersect 2. 0.
- You threw a kn*fe at my face.
- Why would you do that?
- After I worked so hard to get the first one out.
- Dad, kn*fe! Face!
- What if you were wrong?
- I'm never wrong.
- Charles, there's something that I never told you.
- The Intersect... .
- It can have a negative effect on the brain.
- Hold... hold... hold on.
- What? You... you knew?
- You... you knew, and you didn't tell me? !
- I didn't think I had to tell you.
- You didn't tell me you downloaded the new one!
- But that's because I knew you would disapprove of it.
- And... and... you know what? And you left.
- Again.
- You taught me and Ellie how to live life without you, and that's exactly what I'm doing.
- I... I have to go.
- Right now.
- What?
- Wait. Wait. Dad. Dad, where... where are you going?
- I'm sorry.
- I can't stay here and watch my son die.
- Dad?
- You're... you're leaving?
- Weren't you going to say good-bye?
- Oh. Sorry. I'm, uh...
- I still don't even know what's wrong, why you wanted me here.
- Nothing. Nothing's wrong, Dad.
- Oh.
- I just, uh... I missed you, and I wanted to make sure that you were okay.
- Oh, okay.
- Well, you... you don't have to worry about-about me, uh, Eleanor.
- Um, this time, I won't be gone as long, I promise.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Take care of yourself?
- I did it.
- I planted the tracer.
- Nice work, Ellie.
- You've guaranteed your father's protection.
- Where's your dad?
- He found out I was the Intersect, and he left.
- Chuck, he must have had a good reason.
- He loves you.
- I know. I... I...
- I know that he loves me.
- He just doesn't know me.
- He doesn't know anything about me.
- Why I became the Intersect, that... that... that I can help people.
- That for the first time in my life, what I do actually means something.
- Did you tell him that?
- No.
- I guess I didn't.
- But I can't talk to him now because he's gone, and I don't know where he lives.
- I do.
- It's gonna work.
- In the event that your dad ran off, I wanted you to be able to find him, so...
- I took this.
- Your misdemeanor aside, my dad is an incredibly paranoid person,  and I'm sure that this isn't his real address.
- Oh, I know.
- But it was issued by the Bishop County DMV, and I checked all the utilities databases, and this is the only house without cable, water and gas, but also consumes an incredible amount of electricity, so,
- I'm pretty sure that's your dad's house.
- Wow. That's so...
- Spyish?
- Well,
- I am a spy.
- Yeah. We're at the house.
- Good. Don't call me again until you have it.
- Well, this must be it.
- I'm just gonna go in there and tell him how I feel.
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No, it's okay.
- But if I'm not back in 20 minutes, you come save me.
- Okay.
- Where is it?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.
- My employer knows that you have an Intersect.
- Where's the thing that's keeping you alive?
- Dad, it's me.
- Don't worry. I'm alone.
- Cut it. We'll make this look like an accident.
- Oh, that. Oh, that. That... that's not safe.
- That's not safe. He shouldn't be doing that.
- Mr. Bartowski, this will all be a lot less painful if you tell me where the Governor is.
- I don't even know what you're talking about.
- Not you. Your father.
- Aha.
- What is he talking about?
- The Governor!
- Oh.
- It's the watch, isn't it?
- No.
- Tie them up.
- Dad.
- And let's clear out.
- We don't want to be here when this place goes up.
- Sorry about this.
- You shouldn't have come here.
- I didn't want to drag you into anything.
- Dad... Dad I came up.
- I came up here because I wanted to tell you why I downloaded the Intersect, that I'm... that I'm special, and that I can help people.
- But given the circumstances, I think I'm just gonna have to show you.
- No g*n! The gas!
- That's a good idea.
- Does she have the Intersect, too?
- No, Dad.
- That's all her.
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, come in.
- I don't know how the Ring found my cabin.
- But I do know what they... what they came for.
- I call it the Governor 'cause it sort of governs the Intersect.
- See, I realized through the years that... that, just like a computer, that th... the, the Intersect can overheat.
- Is that what's happening to me?
- Yeah, see, your brain is like a circuit, and when you flash, it releases a surge of electrical energy, but if it's not controlled, it can lead to dementia an... and... and insanity, maybe even death, but I've been working on a fix a... and this is the closest that I've gotten to one.
- See, i... it, um, it governs my neural network and helps control the power of the Intersect, almost like a, uh, like a pacemaker would for the heart.
- Could something like that work for the 2. 0?
- Well, I couldn't tell you about it until now 'cause I needed to go back to my cabin to be sure, but, Charles, i... it will.
- I'm gonna make you one.
- You're my son, and you downloaded the 2. 0 for the same reason I created the original, to help people.
- You want to be a spy.
- I'm gonna do everything I can to... help you be the man you want to be.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
- Lester, I want to help you be the man you ought to be.
- It's too late.
- Jeff will be huge here, then he'll be huge in Japan, and then it's over.
- Boy, don't you see?
- The man made a banner that said "Jef" as if it were a question.
- He doesn't know who he is without you.
- You're more than just the 'ster in Jeffster!
- You're the 'ster that stirs the drink.
- I won't be fooled by corporate trickery.
- I will never bow down to the man.
- I'm not the man.
- I'm a man... a man who once had a dream, too.
- You ever heard of Earth, Wind & Fire?
- Yeah, they jammed.
- For a short time in 1988, we were called Earth, Wind, Fire & Rain.
- I was Rain.

- Excuse me, guys.
- Can I speak to you for a second, please?
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
- I talked to Captain Awesome.
- And?
- If he'd have me, I'd let him.
- Look, what I'm saying is, as much as it pains me to say it, if there's a problem here, it's on Ellie's side.
- Hey, look, let me ask you something.
- Why are you even doing this?
- I gave Chuck my word I'd make sure his sister was okay.
- You know what?
- Awesome is volunteering at the animal shelter, Ellie is working the late shift.
- The apartment should be completely empty.
- Perfect.
- I'm gonna go take a look.
- Ellie, are you with your husband?
- No, my husband's not home.
- Everybody thinks that I'm working.
- Okay, do you expect them back anytime soon?
- No, it's safe.
- You're sure?
- Yeah, you can come here.
- Good, I'm already on my way.
- Oh, okay, good.
- There's someone in the house.
- How close are you?
- I'm close, but I may not get there in time.
- Go to the speaker.
- Okay.
- Now open it.
- How?
- Press all three buttons at once and wait for a click.
- Justin, no, I can't, I can't.
- Someone's in your house, Ellie.
- He could hurt you, hurt your family.
- Now take the g*n.
- Ellie, wait!
- Justin, Justin, John Casey...
- Don't worry, you're safe, come with me.
- Hey.
- What's wrong?
- I've been thinking about what happened at the cabin and... how you almost died.
- You know, everything that your dad said about the life that we've chosen...
- He's right.
- What we do is not safe.
- I want you to have this.
- My spy will.
- Why are you giving me this?
- Chuck, this is me.
- It's everything I know, it's my life, and if something were to happen to me...
- Well, if anyone's going to have it, I want it to be you.
- Nothing's going to happen to you.
- You're not going anywhere.
- And neither am I.
- You'll be safe here until we figure out what to do about John Casey.
- I'm so sorry, I just... I couldn't, I couldn't...
- Is my dad going to be okay?
- Don't worry, he's protected.
- What about my husband, though?
- What about my brother?
- They're fine, I promise.
- You've done everything we've asked, Ellie.
- You've been incredibly brave, and trust me, this is almost over.
- Now wait here.
- I'll be back soon.
- "My name is Chuck Bartowski, "
- "and if you're reading this, it means I'm already dead. "
- "I don't know what will end up k*ll me... "
- "... but I've chosen to be a spy, "
- "and there are consequences to that. "
- "It may be my emotions that end up doing me in... "
- "... or a slip-up, trying to protect my friends... "
- "... or my family... "
- "... who never wanted me to be a part of this. "
- My team was captured.
- This needs to happen now... No more waiting.
- "Or it could be the thing I never saw coming, but I know it's coming. "
