# Chuck Versus the Tic Tac

- Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know.
- The Ring used me as a decoy.
- You said I was safe, bro.
- Babe, we need to get away.
- Where do you want to go?
- Doctors Without Borders.
- I'm a spy, buddy.
- My best friend is a spy?
- This is the best news I've ever heard!
- Dismissed.
- Lieutenant Alexander Coburn?
- Thank you for your service, Lieutenant, but you have not qualified for training with Special Operations Command.
- You'll be returning home with your unit at 0800 tomorrow.
- Dismissed.
- Dismissed.
- Tic Tac?
- I'm sorry, Colonel?
- I know it's silly, but they remind me of home.
- Go ahead and keep them.
- I have a feeling you're gonna be out here a while.
- How would you feel if I told you that there was a covert black ops team of America's finest sn*pers, rangers and men willing to do anything to protect this country, and that team wanted you?
- I'd say that sounds like a dream come true, sir.
- And I'd say you have quite a choice to make.
- Either go home to your family or you become the soldier you always dreamed you could be.
- So, tell me, Lieutenant Coburn... are you ready to die today?
- I'm glad you took my call.
- In a matter of hours, General Beckman is gonna give you and your team a Trace Cell Mission to test the CIA's security system.
- I need you to pick something up for me while you're there.
- I know you'll make the right decision.
- You always do.
- 02200 and... two.
- Uh, p. m.
- NSA Agent John Casey in his apartment, speaking to an elderly gentleman.
- And I detect a hint of Midwestern...
- I hear footsteps!
- Coming in from behind me, closer, closer now.
- Whoever finds this video, I want you to...
- Oh, it's just you, Chuck.
- I thought you were KGB, maybe even a ninja.
- Although in that case, your footsteps would've been a lot quieter, wouldn't they?
- Probably.
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- A little spy work.
- I think Casey's getting a mission. Want to listen?
- First of all, if Casey was getting a mission, I would know about it because I would be getting a mission.
- And secondly, you're being kept out of the loop for a reason.
- Spy work is dangerous, buddy.
- I can...
- Ooh, ooh.
- Pleasure working with you again, old friend.
- Working on what?
- Good morning, team.
- Your task this week is a Trace Cell Mission.
- Uh, excuse me, a Trace Cell?
- It means spy-proofing our own security.
- The CIA's most valuable assets are held in a subterranean vault at our Los Angeles facility.
- You'll need to break through 15 levels of security to get there.
- Will Shaw be joining us?
- No, Shaw's in DC.
- Agent Walker, you'll need to catch a later flight to meet him.
- You have your orders. Good luck.
- This is just great.
- So, now you're gonna go meet Shaw in DC.
- Does everyone have a secret mission within a mission?
- It's not a mission, Chuck.
- This time it's personal.
- Oh, oh, right, right, of course.
- Well, that would make sense why I was kept out of that loop.
- My work is here, Chuck, so, please, stay focused.
- We are up against the best security in the world tonight.
- Our own.
- That's the door to level two.
- A hallway.
- Well, seems easy enough.
- Uh-uh.
- Oh.
- This is where you flash.
- Just relax, Chuck, you've got time.
- Nobody's banging down on the door.
- Mission accomplished.
- Pace yourself, Chuck, we've got 14 more levels.
- That was manageable.
- Now, Walker, watch the door.
- Hey, uh, shouldn't we stick together?
- No, always gotta have somebody watch your back.
- I got yours.
- The box we need is around here.
- There it is.
- Did you just take something out of that box?
- No.
- I literally just watched you close it.
- Hey, hey, look, if you're working on some secret side mission, tell me.
- Breathe a word of this to anyone, you're as good as a dead man, Bartowski.
- You understand?
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.
- Chuck, hey.
- I need you to do me a solid, bro.
- I need you to help Ellie commit to Doctors Without Borders.
- What? I-I... I thought that she did.
- Yeah, well, so did I, but I think it all hit her today that it meant leaving LA and leaving you.
- Now, she's gonna come to you and I need you to back me up on this, bro.
- That's probably her now.
- Okay. Okay.
- Is Devon here?
- Chuck, I got it.
- You... you got "it"?
- What is it? What is this?
- Ellie, Ellie, this is amazing. Oh, my God.
- Neurology fellowship at USC?
- You've wanted this since you were in Middle School.
- I know, I know.
- But what do I do?
- Doctors Without Borders is the only thing that Devon has been excited about in weeks.
- Yeah, well, you know, sometimes your dream job isn't always what you expect it to be.
- Unfortunately, your mission at the CIA facility was a day too late.
- The vault had already been compromised and a new drug called Laudanol was stolen.
- Military scientists were able to create a prototype pill that could suppress emotions in battlefield soldiers, make them stronger, faster, fearless.
- Wait a minute, no fear?
- Could that help me flash?
- Well, maybe, but then you wouldn't feel anything, Chuck.
- Right, but I could work... perfectly.
- We'll never know unless we get it back.
- We think this might have been an inside job.
- Only a handful of our people knew the Laudanol was being kept in box 092407.
- Oh, yes.
- I get it now, you're good.
- You are good, General.
- You guys, you are good, very good.
- This is a test, right?
- Bartowski.
- First there was the solo mission on the plane, then turning an asset, now this time it's, "Chuck, will you betray your country"
- "or will you turn in your friend and partner, "
- "John Casey, for stealing the pill? "
- I'll play ball, okay?
- Guilty. He did it.
- Are you positive you saw Colonel Casey take the pill, Mr. Bartowski?
- Yeah.
- No? No.
- No, I would... I would actually not use the word "positive. "
- It was very poorly lit in that, um...
- I... I'm wrong half the time.
- So...
- Colonel Casey?
- Would you care to respond?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on a second.
- Let's just all take a breath here, okay?
- John Casey is one of the most loyal spies out there.
- He would never do anything to jeopardize the CIA.
- Casey, tell them!
- With all due respect, General, I will exercise my right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.
- What?
- What are you doing?
- Agent Walker, please relieve the colonel of his w*apon.
- John, you want to tell me what's going on?
- Which is why I said "Left 4 Dead 2" would be better as an expansion pack...
- I need your help.
- The answer's yes.
- I already set the DVR to record the Mork and Mindy marathon.
- This is not that.
- This is, uh, this spy related, okay?
- Did you happen to record Casey's conversation last night?
- That would depend.
- No, don't worry, don't worry, you're not in trouble.
- I actually need your help.
- Oh, sweet. I knew you'd come around, dude.
- Yeah, sure, absolutely.
- What do you need, audio or video?
- Whatever.
- 2100 and 43 p. m.
- There's a chill in the air and hint of vanilla.
- A man enters Casey's apartment.
- Is that static?
- Carrots actually.
- I'm sorry. I get hungry on a stakeout.
- Holy crap.
- What is it, Chuck? I want in.
- You know what, Morgan? Trust me, in this case, the fewer details you know, the better.
- Call me if you need me.
- Hey, show some respect.
- This guy was one of the best that we had.
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Still no sign of the Laudanol.
- Sarah.
- I just flashed.
- Casey is being played.
- His old commanding officer's a guy named James Keller.
- High up in special ops.
- He's the guy who turned Casey's former sensei, because now he's a member of the Ring.
- What?
- Casey doesn't know anything.
- We got to talk to him and tell him who this Keller guy really is.
- We can't. Casey committed treason.
- And he's still refusing to talk.
- They're moving him to a black site in Thailand...
- Outside of US torture jurisdictions.
- When?
- Tomorrow morning.
- Okay, then we've got to break him out before then and clear his name.
- If we do this, and if we get caught, we're gonna be tried for treason, and you're gonna lose everything and you're never going to get a chance to be a real spy.
- Is that what you want?
- It's Casey.
- You sure you're okay missing your flight to DC?
- Yeah, Shaw can wait, Casey can't.
- He's in a holding cell on level 15.
- Now all we have to do is just break through the security we just spy-proofed.
- Well, it's only been 24 hours.
- I'd be surprised if they fixed anything.
- All right then.
- Time to save the day.
- Chuck, are you okay?
- Well, that wasn't there before.
- Alert the general.
- We've captured two infiltrators.
- I see you've encountered my new security measures.
- Well done. Well done.
- Yeah, really excellent work.
- You deserve a medal for adjusting all these security measures so quickly.
- Yes, General Beckman, the spy-proofing is excellent.
- Who to thank?
- Uh, Fitzroy. Stanley Fitzroy.
- It means "son of the king".
- Did you get that, General? Fitzroy?
- Son of the king... She knew that as well.
- That's incredible.
- Yeah, okay, great.
- Uh, my name is Charles Carmichael.
- And this is my partner Sarah Walker.
- Uh, we're secure.
- Please forgive the intrusion and condescending tone.
- I wasn't informed that you two were coming.
- But then that must have been the point.
- Um, do you like what I did on level one?
- Very impressive.
- Very.
- Very, very.
- In fact, uh, I think we'd both love to see what you've done with level 15.
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, let me show you.
- I'll give you the tour.
- I thought you'd be happy for me.
- Babe, I am.
- But if we do Doctors Without Borders, we could save lives.
- We can save lives here in LA next to my brother.
- I just talked to Chuck this morning.
- He thought it was a great idea.
- Oh, really? I find that hard to believe because I told him about USC and he was happy for me.
- Well, then I guess we'll go talk to Chuck.
- Oh, nice to see you, too.
- Third opinion never hurts.
- Ellie agreed to do this.
- I agreed to do Doctors Without Borders, which is a fantastic organization, She said, and I quote, "I'm in". but that was before I found out about my Médecins Sans Frontières, USC neurology is every good doctor's fellowship at USC, dream job.
- Which is, like, my dream job.
- Devon, it appears to me you're being completely selfish.
- Morgan, sidebar now.
- Just a sec, babe.
- You can't tell Ellie to stay here.
- Why?
- If you had all the information that I had, you'd know that it's not safe for her here.
- If you had all the Intel I had, you'd know that it is, in fact, the safest place for her to be.
- What exactly do you mean by that?
- Nothing. Chuck's here.
- He'd look after her.
- Yes, but Chuck's job can sometimes be more demanding than most would expect.
- Indeed, sir, indeed.
- Sure, Nerd Herding does often call for more than just computer installs.
- Do you know?
- Do you know?
- Do I know what?
- What do you think I know?
- I don't think you know half what you think you know.
- Fine. On three, we both say what we know.
- Okay.
- One, two, three.
- Chuck's a...
- Chuck's a...
- Oh, my God, you know.
- Oh, my God, you know.
- When did you know? When did you find out?
- A while, bro.
- Man, it is so cool, huh?
- Yeah, it's awesome, but every time I go on a mission, I put Ellie in danger, and I can't have that.
- Right. I didn't think about that.
- Wait, you went on missions?
- You haven't?
- What? Of course, dude...
- You guys... I never saw you out there.
- Hmm-hmm.
- Ellie, I've been thinking, kids in LA, eh, they don't need your help.
- You know, with their fancy designer jeans and Lady Gaga sunglasses.
- I say far, far away is where a doctor could do the most good.
- I think that you should go and do Doctors Without Borders, all right?
- Médecins Sans Frontières.
- Medecinse So Franswarez.
- Médecins Sans Frontières.
- Médecins Sans Frontières.
- So, that was 14. Here's level 15.
- I'm just so glad you're pleased with my new security measures.
- You know, I'm kind of your biggest fan.
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, I read and file all of your mission reports.
- Remember when you reverse-engineered an antidote to that w*apon and kissed Colonel Casey only to realize later it was all for naught?
- That must've been exciting and scary at the same time, huh?
- Can we just skip the details for now?
- We'll get into that later.
- Right now I'm... I'm really interested in how you've secured this holding cell.
- I'm the newest security measure.
- I have the only key card in the whole building.
- This card is the only thing that stands between the bad guys and the holding cell.
- Stanley...
- Hmm?
- We're gonna need that key card.
- But...
- Oh.
- Oh, no.
- I'll swallow the key card if I have to.
- Well, that's weird.
- If we're still out here, how is the alarm going off?
- Somebody's coming. We don't have time for this.
- Time for what?
- Was that absolutely necessary?
- Yes.
- There, look, Casey.
- I really hope that wasn't me.
- Don't take another step. We just want the Colonel.
- Casey, you don't understand.
- Keller is not who you think he is.
- He's part of the Ring.
- Let's go, John.
- I can't believe that Casey's a member of the Ring.
- What are we supposed to do now?
- We just broke out of a CIA facility.
- We gotta get out of here first.
- Worry about finding the Ring later.
- When three of my agents are arrested for treason in 24 hours, it reflects poorly on me.
- Look, General, Casey...
- You don't know John Casey.
- Not the way you think.
- His real name is Alex Coburn.
- We've unsealed his file and this is what we've learned.
- Alex Coburn faked his death in Honduras in 1989, the same day that John Casey was recruited for NSA Black Ops by a Colonel James Keller.
- Keller must've recruited him again and this time for the Ring.
- And it's crucial the Laudanol doesn't fall into their hands.
- The only reason you're not in federal prison right now is because I have a mission only you can accomplish.
- Find and capture Colonel John Casey.
- Dead or alive.
- Whoa!
- Don't say a word.
- Casey?
- Mm-hmm.
- I get it, I get it.
- This is some kind of mission, isn't it?
- Yeah, that's right.
- How would you like to be a part of a very important, very secret mission?
- Yeah, yeah, can I get a cool call name like Condor or Lady Fingers?
- Yeah.
- Three years... three years of missions, training, I'm his friend.
- How can all of that have been a lie?
- I don't know, some people change.
- You move forward as a spy, and the line between what's right and wrong becomes more and more gray.
- You don't know what to believe in or... who to believe in.
- I thought you had changed.
- What do you mean?
- I know that you want to be the perfect spy, and I know what it means to you and what you've sacrificed to get there.
- But please don't lose that guy that I met three years ago.
- Don't give up on the things that make you great.
- I'll always be that guy.
- Sarah, I...
- We should probably focus on the Laudanol.
- So, the only reason that Keller would go to all that trouble to break Casey out would be if he still didn't have it.
- Which means if we get to it before Casey does, we've got a sh*t at catching him.
- Yeah, except there's nothing left in the apartment.
- What about the Buy More?
- No, Casey's smarter than that.
- He knows he would never get past those surveillance cameras undetected.
- He would have to use somebody.
- And that someone would have to be either desperate, stupid, or just plain willing to do anything to impress him.
- Planet of the Apes, huh?
- Planning on watching that alone?
- Yeah, well, you know me, I can't get enough POTA.
- Liar.
- You hated the original because their upper lips never moved.
- I just...
- I know, it's just so unrealistic!
- Morgan, did Casey ask you to come here and get something for him?
- No, never.
- Really? Really? Is that so?
- And could that something be in the case that you're holding right now?
- That is absurd.
- Now you're just making stuff up.
- Now you're just trying to...
- Listen, this is my first mission, Chuck, and I don't want to screw it up.
- Now Casey, he told me that I can't tell you anything, and I won't.
- I'm a rock.
- If you give me that case right now, I promise that later I will answer all questions that you have about any of my missions.
- In sordid detail?
- Promise.
- You're making the right choice.
- Okay, you're making the right choice.
- Sarah, I got it.
- Where's Grimes?
- You convinced the little rodent to give you the case, didn't you?
- I knew he was weak.
- Tell me where it is, now.
- Don't make me do this, Bartowski.
- Don't sh**t.
- Give me the case and I won't have to.
- I believed in you.
- I trusted you.
- Chuck.
- I know everything, Casey.
- I know everything, okay?
- I know that you used to be Alex Coburn.
- I know that you work for James Keller, and that you stole the Laudanol for the Ring.
- The only thing I don't know is why.
- Alex Coburn...
- I had a fiancée.
- Now she thinks I'm dead.
- And if I don't turn over the Laudanol to the Ring, they're gonna k*ll her.
- Her name's Kathleen McHugh.
- 20 years ago, she was the girl I was gonna marry.
- Love of my life.
- But to be a spy and protect our country, I had to give up that life.
- And now she's going to die because of a decision I made.
- No, we're not gonna let that happen.
- If I don't deliver the Laudanol to his location in the next hour, they're gonna k*ll her.
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go save her.
- If I don't show at the meet, Keller will know something's wrong.
- Well, then Chuck will go to Kathleen's.
- Yeah, yeah, Sarah's right, I'll go.
- Look, just give me the address, I'll sneak her out of there, put her in a safe house.
- I will protect her, Casey, I promise.
- You could be charged with treason.
- Hell, you didn't even know I was Alex Coburn until today.
- I don't care who you were.
- I know who you are.
- And you're not in this alone.
- Keller still expects you at the meet.
- What are we going to do?
- Let's go to a meeting.
- I'm alone, I'm unarmed.
- All I've got is this here Cuban.
- You mind?
- Smoke it.
- Hi, uh, Ms. McHugh?
- Yes, may I help you?
- Yes, I'm with the gas company.
- I was just checking your meter here out back, and yeah, I do detect a gas leak.
- I'm sorry to tell you, so I need you to leave with me.
- Come on! Oh...
- Back inside the house. Back inside the house quick!
- But I thought you said...
- Well, ignore everything I said previously.
- The gas leak is actually outside the house.
- What?
- Trust me, ma'am, it's my job to smell these things.
- See, I've been doing it for years.
- The whole cul-De-sac could blow right now!
- So, I need you back inside, back inside the house.
- Inside, inside!
- Okay, this is, um, this is getting kind of weird.
- Who are you really?
- I'm sorry, I promise I'm not crazy.
- This is for your own good.
- Huh?
- Hey!
- Hey, let me outta here!
- Hello, Alex.
- You got the Laudanol?
- I knew I could count on you.
- Good soldiers always follows orders.
- You know, you wouldn't be in this mess if you'd done what I told you 20 years ago.
- You were supposed to let go of her.
- Stop caring.
- Tic Tac?
- What the hell is this?
- Your breath stinks.
- You think you're just going to walk out of here?
- I got five men outside.
- The one thing I always taught you, make sure you have someone watch your back.
- I know.
- Five against one.
- You didn't think this through!
- You can't k*ll me or Kathleen will die.
- You'd never call them off.
- You're right.
- They're already at the house.
- Gas company, Ms. McHugh.
- I'm the gas company.
- Guys, how far are you?
- Five minutes.
- Look, anything immediate, you're gonna have to handle yourself.
- Yeah, well, everything is immediate!
- Well, then you have to flash.
- I can't. There's too many of them.
- Take the pill, Chuck.
- What pill?
- You gave him the pill?
- It's in your right pocket.
- The Laudanol was developed to calm emotions, eliminate fear.
- Chuck, it can make you the Intersect you were always supposed to be.
- Gas company, Ms. McHugh.
- Open up!
- Chuck!
- I just checked the meter, everything's fine.
- Come on, let me out! Help!
- Thank you so much... Hey!
- Wait a second. What the... ?
- You're not from the gas company.
- I'm not afraid... of any of you.
- Chuck! Chuck, stop!
- Oh, my God.
- Do I know you?
- Kath, I'm sorry. I... I can't come home sooner.
- I've got one more mission.
- I think I'm going really be able to help people.
- You don't have to explain.
- You love what you do and you're good at it.
- I just want you to know, if something happens to me, no matter what, I love you.
- Listen, you're never one to get emotional with me, so don't let your guard down now.
- That way you can get back to me in one piece.
- Got it?
- Yes, ma'am.
- And when you do come back, I've got some news...
- Tonight at 2200, Lieutenant Alex Coburn will be k*ll in battle.
- He'll die a hero and be given a hero's funeral.
- From this point on, your name is John Casey.
- Make it a good life, soldier.
- The authorities just arrived, Ms. McHugh.
- Mom.
- Alex.
- What's with the police cars outside?
- It's okay. Shh, it's okay.
- I'll be all right.
- Casey...
- Wait.
- You... you can't just...
- What's dead is dead.
- It's too late now.
- Despite the success of the mission, Colonel Casey, you abused your privileged position and if you were anyone else, you would be right back in jail.
- But you are not just anyone.
- And I'm about to give you your second second chance.
- Which is two more than most people get.
- Thank you, General.
- Second chance as a civilian.
- Um...
- But, uh-uh, General, Casey has given his entire life to this country.
- I mean, surely you can't just make him start over.
- He's done it once before.
- He shouldn't have a problem doing it again.
- For the final time, you are dismissed.
- Good luck, John.
- Mr. Bartowski...
- Please escort Mr. Casey off government property.
- I want to commend you, Agent Walker, for your work with the Intersect.
- He seems to need you less and less.
- Yes, uh, Chuck has certainly changed, and he is well on his way to becoming the perfect spy.
- A while back you requested a transfer out of Burbank, and I haven't forgotten.
- There's an empty seat on my flight back to DC, if you'd still like to go.
- We could discuss it on the way.
- I leave in an hour, if you'd like to join me, Agent Walker.
- Thank you.
- Hey, stranger.
- I'm sorry, you are?
- Your brother, who you never see.
- How are you?
- You okay? You look exhausted.
- I am. It's this, uh, it's this Doctors Without Borders thing.
- I think Devon really wants to do it.
- And I did, too.
- So I think I'm going to do it, Chuck.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- USC neurology... That's kind of been your dream ever since you were a kid, El.
- I know, I know.
- But dreams change.
- And if there is one thing that I know for sure, it's that I want to be with Devon.
- And it might require some sacrifice from both of us, but he's the best choice I ever made.
- There you are, El.
- Hey, uh...
- Can I steal you away?
- Yeah.
- Love you. Both.
- Babe...
- I realize that I didn't congratulate you for getting the fellowship.
- And that was only my first mistake.
- But I should have talked to you first.
- If this is important to you, then it is important to me.
- I'm sorry I lost sight of that.
- Babe, take the job.
- We'll make it work.
- Together.
- See?
- This space can work.
- It'll be great for civilian life.
- I mean, take a look around.
- You got a... you got a nice chair.
- You know, you can still go back.
- The general made the terms of my dismissal crystal clear.
- I was talking about Kathleen.
- She lives right around here, man.
- And, uh, you got a daughter, Casey.
- You know I made my decision between love and love of country a long time ago.
- And it was the right decision for me.
- Now you have to make a decision whether that's the right one for you.
- Walker's a good woman.
- It's still not too late.
- DC's beautiful this time of year.
- You from this area?
- No.
- But I'm thinking of moving here.
