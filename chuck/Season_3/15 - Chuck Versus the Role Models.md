# Chuck Versus the Role Models

- This is my boss, Charles Bartowski.
- A computer repairman with all the government's secrets in his head.
- This is his girl, Sarah Walker.
- A CIA agent with more than just k*ll looks.
- And when these two spies first met, it was love at first fight.
- That's where I come in.
- I'm Morgan. It's my job to keep an eye on the both of them, which isn't always easy.
- Oh, hey, dude.
- I had the most incredible dream, man.
- I was, uh... Hey.
- Uh, do you want some?
- Hello? Morgan?
- Hi.
- Do you want some orange juice?
- Orange juice? Orange juice.
- Absolutely. Man, that sounds good.
- Vitamin Ds are very important- Vitamin Cs.
- Vitamin C, singular.
- Great. Sorry.
- The jug's so big.
- Jug- I'm sorry, I...
- I hate you, Chuck. I hate you.
- Good morning, buddy.
- Okay, I get it.
- You're having tons and tons of sex.
- Congratulations, Warren b*at.
- Who said anything about...
- Your big, goofy grin said it, okay?
- And, you know, it's kind of an insult for those of us living in the apartment who aren't having sex.
- Which is me.
- Sorry. Sorry about that.
- I'm just really happy.
- Well, duh. You're dating a leggy Valkyrie who has an aversion to clothing.
- Says the guy who likes to sleep in the nude.
- Au buffo.
- Oh, well, I'll have you know that I've actually made the very painful concession of wearing pajamas.
- I mean, you never know when she's going to be stopping by now and...
- Well, I think you can pretty much count on Sarah being here every night, because I'm about to ask her if she wants to move in.
- Okay. Well, you two probably have a lot to talk about.
- Hi.
- I was going to surprise you.
- Take you out to a nice dinner and give you your own key.
- But...
- How would you like to move in?
- Why would we do that?
- Why? Well, because I figured since you're sleeping here most nights anyway...
- We're not a normal couple, so why do we need to pretend like we have a normal life?
- Who's pretending?
- Okay, I, I didn't mean it like that.
- I love working with you and I love being with you, so...
- Why mess with a good thing, right?
- We can talk more after work.
- Right, yeah.
- Yeah, we'll talk more after work, 'cause I know how good a thing this is.
- What are you doing?
- Well, I left my g*n in my hotel room.
- No, what are you doing, storing your g*n in my couch?
- Morgan Morgan could find those. What, you've not heard of the 30-foot rule?
- As a matter of fact, no, I have not.
- A good agent should never be without a backup w*apon.
- Well, have you ever heard of the Bartowski rule?
- No firearms in my apartment.
- Well, not if you want to live with a spy.
- Hey, Chuck. Got your message.
- Everything is fine.
- Sorry we can't talk. We're moving to a new clinic.
- We're here, babe.
- Hang up. Love you. Bye.
- Excuse me, Doctors Without Borders.
- Any idea where the field clinic is?
- Nothing?
- Babe, I think this is the clinic.
- Honey, I have seen more patients in two weeks than I've seen in my first few years as a doctor.
- You have any idea who the men with the g*n are?
- The UN wear blue berets and the FDLR wear black berets.
- Great, but Devon, these guys aren't wearing any berets.
- Hey. Hey.
- Whoever they are, they're in charge.
- Honey, what have we gotten ourselves into? Remember what they said about this being the toughest job you'll ever love?
- We're making a difference.
- I know, I know. That's not what's getting to me.
- What's getting to me is the not showering and the not sleeping and the not knowing who the men with the g*n are.
- Hmm?
- Well, how about a date night?
- I'll cook dinner for you tonight.
- Just you and me under the stars.
- Okay.
- I'm sure it'll clear up any minute.
- Mm, mwa.
- You're my boy.
- Over here! Follow me.
- You're in charge.
- What do you mean
- "we're not in charge"?
- Are you demoting us, General? No.
- You will be acting in an observational capacity on this mission.
- The primary agents are named Craig and Laura Turner.
- Never heard of them.
- AKA George and Bitsy Witherspoon?
- The CIA team who stopped the Air France hijacking in '86?
- AKA John and Suzie Smythe?
- The ones who broke up the Uranium smuggling ring back in '91.
- I could go on and on listing the Turner's aliases and accomplishments.
- So, they've been around the CIA block.
- Well, that's good for them They have also been married for the last 30 years- more or less.
- And this is relevant to us, how?
- As long as you and Agent Bartowski insist on keeping a personal relationship, I insist you learn how to go about it properly.
- Your mission is to watch and learn from the best couple the CIA has ever produced.
- Hmm.
- And you, Colonel Casey...
- I'll head on down to Pendleton, recertify my w*apon training.
- It's not your training that concerns me.
- I'm talking about Morgan Grimes.
- It was your idea to make him a part of the team.
- It's your job to make him field-ready.
- You can't be serious, General.
- He's a diamond in the rough- very, very rough, but I'm sure you'll make him sparkle.
- Diamond.
- Diamond in the rough...
- Would you please sit down?
- You're making me nervous.
- The Turners are going to be here any minute.
- What, you've never met a CIA agent before? You, what- come on.
- You heard Beckman- these guys are the best of the best. They're a super spy couple.
- I don't want them thinking we're a couple of rubes.
- What a dump!
- Can you imagine being stationed here?
- Remember when the CIA held rooms for us at the Grand Ambassador?
- Ah, the salad days!
- What'd you say their names were again?
- I believe their names are Bertruski or Bertrowski.
- Something ethnic.
- Two young agency hotshots.
- And they're here. And they're here!
- Dear God, it's us 30 years ago.
- Look, Sarah, that's us in 30 years.
- So there you have it: Operation Mongoose.
- Made it out of Berlin with half the KGB on my tail. If it hadn't been for that woman in the fur coat with the AK-47...
- Enough with the Cold w*r stories, darling...
- You're boring our hosts.
- No-no, no.
- This is, this is, this is fascinating, uh, to me at-at least.
- A toast, Charles, to old spy stories.
- Oh, Mrs. Turner, can I get you a drink?
- No, thank you. I'm fine with my water.
- The wife does not partake, so I guess I'll just have to toast for both of us.
- A serviceable Manhattan, Charles.
- Is there something wrong with your cherry?
- Actually, a true Manhattan is made with a rare and delicate marasca cherry...
- The only place you can find those, here in LA would be...
- The Grand Ambassador. The Grand Ambassador.
- Don't be a booze snob, darling. Getting back to your story, though, the woman in the fur coat, I'm assuming, was you, Mrs. Turner?
- Mm. That's how the two of you met?
- How we got divorced.
- The hussy in the fur was a Russian double agent.
- I thought the two of you were married.
- Remarried- three times.
- Some women are too special to marry just once.
- My, look at the time.
- Goodness, we'd better get going.
- Oh, so soon?
- This has been just great.
- Sarah and I cannot wait to work with the two of you.
- Oh, you won't have to.
- The mission is tonight, Charles.
- The target is Otto Von Vogel.
- Otto has created a decryption program that could render CIA security useless.
- Tonight's party is a smoke screen for him to meet potential buyers. Our job is to access Otto's master suite, where he stores the software.
- Okay, great. What do you want us to do?
- Your job: Watch and learn.
- I can't wait to watch these two in action.
- It is going to be great.
- What?
- So what are Chuck and Sarah up to tonight?
- Some sort of sexy spy dinner party?
- Shh! Oh, right. Sorry, sorry.
- I don't know. You ask me, this whole man gig's starting to become a real snore, you know?
- When am I going to put the hurt on some t*rror1st? You know, get in there?
- Whatever it is you think you know about being a spy, you're wrong, hmm?
- Oh, oh... Okay.
- You're a child.
- You're a liability to the team.
- You're not doing anything until you've been properly trained.
- Understood?
- Wait a minute- does that mean... ?
- I can't believe I'm going to say this.
- I'm going to Langley!
- You're not going anywhere, jackass.
- I can teach you everything you need to know right here in the store. Come on.
- Oh, yeah. Start with the neck thing. That was awesome!
- So, that's Otto, I take it.
- Avoid him and his guards.
- If anyone asks who you are, tell them you're our nephew, Bernard.
- Actually, tell them she's our niece.
- No offense, Charles.
- No, none taken.
- Shall we work the room first?
- After you, my love.
- Here we go.
- How's the tennis elbow, Monty?
- Can I give you a word of advice?
- Eat and rest.
- You see, consummate professionals.
- I mean, what do you think makes them such a great spy team?
- Um, a lifetime of training.
- Very funny. I'm talking about them being a couple.
- I honestly can't believe the CIA doesn't hire more of us.
- They're not that great. Oh, don't be jealous.
- I'm not jealous. I'm just saying they're not that great.
- Sarah, we, uh, we may have a slight problem.
- There you are Otto, old boy!
- We heard you were in town and assumed you were having a party.
- I don't recall putting you two on the guest list.
- I'm just kidding.
- Look at your faces!
- Oh, Otto, you are terrible.
- As they say in my country, "mein Haus ist ihr Haus. "
- Textbook subversion. Not bad.
- You know, we could take a page out of the Turners' playbook.
- You're not going to ask me to move in with you again, are you?
- No, why... Well, not now. Maybe later.
- At ease.
- All right, there are three qualities that make for an effective field agent: Subversion, Me.
- Stealth... Me.
- Strength...
- First things first.
- See that customer over there?
- Oh, my goodness- super-hottie?
- Yeah, I clocked her when she first came in.
- I want you to get her phone number.
- Yeah, right.
- No, seriously, what's the first step?
- A spy must be able to manipulate any target at any time.
- In the field, it can make the difference between life and death.
- Copy that. Yes, sir.
- Ooh, what about her, though?
- Silver-tops really eat me up.
- You have your target. Engage.
- ♪ ♪
- Get on with it.
- Hmm.
- Target has been neutralized.
- I thought Bartowski was hopeless.
- ♪ ♪
- Well, I'm not sure where the Turners went.
- Maybe they already made their move.
- I thought she said she didn't drink?
- Yeah.
- Hit me.
- Hi. Hi, Mrs. Turner, uh...
- Sarah and I were just wondering if the mission is still going according to plan.
- Is, um, something wrong?
- Her.
- It's disgusting.
- Man's old enough to be her father!
- Perhaps he's just giving her some fatherly advice?
- Bastard left his Mic on.
- CRAIG You are a very, naughty girl.
- It's too bad my wife is here.
- Perhaps we can hook up later at my hotel?
- The man's nothing but a CIA-sanctioned gigolo.
- Oh... you don't mean that.
- Oh, wait, uh, where, where are you going?
- Upstairs to steal the software.
- At least one of us is still a professional.
- I'll handle this.
- Here, let me... Get...
- Get your hands off me! Please, you're fighting me.
- Don't touch me! You're making a scene.
- Don't touch me!
- Dear Lord, my back.
- Oh, this is not good.
- It's an old service injury.
- Oh, you threw your back out with a Havana hooker.
- It was all in the line of duty, my dear. Oh, right, yeah.
- Give us a moment. Don't even start with me.
- It will fix itself- the back, not her.
- We should get out of here before they blow all of our covers.
- Don't touch me!
- What about the software?
- Let's show the Turners how it's done, hmm?
- Is there a nurse here?
- Someone in a short skirt?
- Master suite. Master suite...
- Master suite. Yeah.
- Otto's safe has to be around here somewhere.
- Gesundheit. Thank you.
- There's got to be a cat around here.
- My allergies are going crazy.
- Whoa. Hey! Look at this!
- Our buddy, Otto, into some kinky stuff, even by German standards.
- Chuck?
- Yeah?
- Put the whip down.
- Why?
- Not a fan of the whip, are you, big fella?
- I'll just put this away and let you get back to your cat nap.
- Ow, gee!
- Chuck! Mm-hmm?
- Run!
- Yeah, go, go, go, go!
- The software- the software is on the tiger's collar.
- Get the chair.
- If I just had my tranq g*n.
- No, no, that's not a tranq g*n.
- I am not letting you sh**t a tiger.
- They are endangered and majestic.
- Do you have any better ideas? I think what we need to be asking ourselves is what would the Turners do?
- Survive in the field,  an agent also has to employ stealth.
- Good. Done- are you kidding me?
- I move like a cat.
- I want you to steal something for me.
- Look at these hands- small and nimble.
- Steal anything in the store. Look at this. Boom. Done.
- I got... No!
- I have something a little more difficult in mind.
- Oh, come on, really?
- Suck it up.
- Target acquired.
- Okay, okay, the Turners aren't perfect.
- I'm willing to modify my opinion.
- She's a drunk and he's a philanderer.
- As a team, they're a total mess.
- Well, come on, they're not completely without their charms.
- I mean, there could be worse people that we could turn into.
- I would rather be eaten alive by a tiger.
- Speaking of, I am done waiting around for Otto to find us.
- Let's get the software and get out of here.
- Shh-shh-shh.
- I've heard that noise before.
- It sounds like...
- Your mission, moron, is to steal Big Mike's keycard.
- See? What'd I tell you?
- Sleeping just like Big Mike after eating a baker's dozen.
- Okay, shh.
- Shh. Shh.
- Okay, give me the g*n. I'll cover you.
- No, no, no, I'll cover you.
- You get the collar. No, trust me.
- You have that, that feline instinct.
- I know how to use a g*n better than you do.
- See, still don't think that's a great idea.
- Just do it. Okay, fine.
- ♪ ♪
- Oh, my God!
- Why didn't you sh**t it!
- It was about to eat me.
- You said he was majestic.
- He's a little majestic.
- Come on.
- Grimes?
- I told you I don't like people looking at me when I'm asleep.
- Mm-hmm. I know, it's just you had me so worried, I...
- For a second there, I thought you were dead.
- What's that in your hand?
- This is your keycard.
- Yeah, and, uh, I thought it was cutting off your air supply, your air-air pipe. Mm-hmm.
- You know and then your esophagi. And then, I'm looking and I'm like, there's jelly all over... Give me that.
- Yeah. You can take it, 'cause I was just going to wash it for you. I'm a grown man.
- Yeah, you are. I can clean up after myself.
- Naturally.
- But you can get me another one of those doughnuts.
- Thank you for going to all this trouble.
- Babe, I'm your husband.
- It's my job to take care of you, honey.
- Still, I feel silly.
- You know, there's people here with real problems.
- You get to feel how you feel.
- It's a lot to adjust to.
- I guess I'm having a hard time shaking the whole city girl thing.
- I'm sort of...
- Out of my element.
- I'm not really an outdoorsy type.
- Don't move, babe.
- Devon, what are you looking at?
- Don't breathe. Do not...
- It's okay.
- You're the new guys, right?
- The husband and wife team? Yeah, I'm, uh, Justin.
- Camp security coordinator.
- Um... you might want to set up camp a little further away from the perimeter.
- The animals get a little curious at night.
- You okay, honey? Oh, yeah.
- We're making a difference. We're making a difference.
- Sorry I wasn't around when you guys arrived.
- Outside of your snake friend here, we're all very grateful to have you both here.
- Yeah, we need all the doctors we can find.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, anytime.
- And, uh... welcome to Africa.
- Yeah.
- We're okay.
- We'll be all right.
- We're all right.
- Okay, here's the deal: We'll call the Turners from the road.
- Impressive.
- You know, I didn't think they had it in them.
- What are you guys doing?
- We're teaching you a little something about spying.
- Lesson one: trust no one...
- Except your partner, of course.
- We'll take Otto's software.
- Wha... ? What? ! No, no!
- You're the Turners! You can't be doing this to us.
- Don't feel bad, Charles.
- We're the best at this.
- What do you mean, they went rogue?
- General, Mrs. Turner pulled a g*n on me.
- And might I add, I think she may have a bit of a problem with the, uh, sauce.
- Uh, the Turners stole Otto's software.
- The Turners are two of the most decorated spies in the CIA.
- There must be some explanation for their behavior.
- I suggest you find it.
- Well, I'd be happy to track them down if you want to ask them yourself.
- Colonel, you have your mission.
- Oh, yeah, how is that field training with Morgan going?
- Put it this way.
- He makes you look like a natural-born operative.
- If you can't make Morgan Grimes field-ready, I'm sending you both to boot camp in Pendleton.
- That is all.
- Great. This is just great.
- This is, this is perfect.
- Not only did the Turners sell us out, they make us look like complete amateurs in the process.
- Chuck, why are you doing dishes?
- Please? I'm a Bartowski.
- This is what we do to deal with stress. We clean.
- Okay, I can see that you're upset.
- I am upset. The Turners were supposed to be our role models,  and instead, they turn out to be these coldhearted double-crossing traitors.
- And now, now you're never gonna move in with me.
- Chuck, we're not the Turners.
- Yeah, I know.
- But I kind of liked the idea that we could become them.
- Well, right now, we really need to focus on finding them.
- Sarah, how? The Turners have been spying for 30 years.
- They've got dozens of aliases and a million different places they could disappear to.
- Whatever beach they're on right now I hope that Mr. Turner's enjoying his perfect little Manhattan.
- The Grand Ambassador.
- What? He said last night that that was the only place in Los Angeles that had the right kind of cherries.
- Hold, hold on a second. Hold on.
- You... you don't actually think they're still hanging around here, do you?
- Well, they might if they already had a buyer for the software.
- They picked the wrong couple to stab in the back.
- This is how I deal with stress.
- Here we go.
- Yes, she's gonna help you.
- Can you take care of this lady? Thank you.
- Hey, it's Chuck. Leave a message.
- Hi. Uh, I don't know if you got any of my other messages, Chuck.
- I don't know. It's just kind of helping me to talk them out over the machine.
- I can't really talk to Devon about anything.
- He's, like, born to be here.
- The villagers love him.
- They have this nickname for him.
- We can't really pronounce it in Bantu, but it loosely translates to "Dr. Super Fantastic White Person. "
- I'm just tired.
- I'm just tired, and I'll feel better when I get some sleep.
- Okay, I love you and I miss you.
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Ellie. Yeah?
- How are you?
- Great. You know, if you ever need to talk, you can always come to me.
- It's just one of my jobs.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Good.
- Mm, I'm not fine.
- Huh. I-I have a little brother, and, uh, we used to camp out in our backyard.
- I would, I would pitch a tent and make s'mores, the whole thing.
- He'd fall asleep, and I'd sneak back inside and set the alarm for the morning and get in there before he could wake up.
- I just... Justin, I'm not built for this.
- That's not true.
- I've seen you with your patients, Ellie.
- You are built for being a doctor here.
- Now, it might take time to get used to the other stuff, but...
- It's worth it.
- Thank you, Justin.
- Welcome.
- Mmm!
- I can get used to this.
- You will, darling, as soon as we make the sale.
- 30 years, we always did what's right.
- I keep thinking of those poor, young agents.
- What a pair of saps.
- Reminded me of us.
- I just hope we didn't hurt their career.
- They never had a career, not with the CIA.
- You saw how they looked at each other.
- They're obviously in love.
- And we're not?
- Oh, no, no, we're still in love.
- A different sort of love.
- It's just more like a... an old bourbon.
- So now I'm old? Aged to perfection, my dear.
- How about that little piece of jailbait at the party?
- Was that you trying to cork a younger vintage?
- I see where you're going with the metaphor.
- No, she was just part of the mission; a diversion.
- How many times have I heard that excuse, you lecherous old... ? !
- She was planning on having breast enhancement surgery, and she asked my advice.
- You'd like to give her an operation, wouldn't you?
- She was obviously in awe of me, if not in love.
- Room service!
- Go ahead and leave it.
- All clear.
- "Compliments of the Bartowski's. "
- Darling, do we know any Bartowski... ?
- How did you ever find us?
- You're the only room that ordered 12 Manhattans.
- We learned from the best.
- You don't know what that w*apon is, do you?
- What? Are you kidding me?
- Sig 229 nine millimeter, 13-round magazine.
- Laser grip, full metal jacket, sir.
- Impressive.
- Yeah, well, I play a lot of first-person sh**t.
- Well, this isn't a video game.
- Hey, whoa-whoa.
- Thank you.
- All right.
- Here we go. No problem.
- Morgan, you got this.
- Just like Call of Duty.
- Squeeze the trigger...
- Oh!
- Holy cow! I think your g*n just exploded in my hand!
- Sit down! There's nothing wrong with the g*n.
- Hmm? Sit down!
- No, I-I think should... Sit!
- Yes, sir.
- You're firing me, aren't you?
- Oh, my God, this is even worse than when I got canned from Underpants, Etc.
- It's not the end of the world.
- Oh, come on! That's what you all say when you fire me.
- I blew it.
- I blew my one chance to be a spy, and the thing is, Casey, all I wanted to do was be a part of this team.
- Know how you feel.
- You know, Morgan, you were there for me when I was out on my ass with the agency.
- I just want you to know I'm here for you now.
- Really?
- Not just like spy or work or Buy More, you mean like a friend.
- Let's just keep that on the down low, huh?
- Done. Shh. But I need you to know something.
- I've been canned from a lot of places.
- By a lot of people, and... you were the best, sir.
- Whew!
- Let's not let ourselves get carried away here, Charles.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Turner.
- Is that what you think, that I'm getting carried away? How did you think we would react after what you did?
- What have we really done at this point, Sarah?
- We didn't sell Otto's software, so technically, we're not yet traitors.
- Am I correct?
- It was his idea to steal it.
- He forced me to act like a drunk at the party.
- I only wish his lecherous Lothario routine was an act.
- She's lying! I wanted to bring the software back.
- It was her idea to sell it on the black market.
- Oh, no, no, you can't lie to the...
- You can lie to me.
- Your duplicity amazes me.
- Quiet!
- Enough, okay?
- It is one thing to betray your agency, it is another to betray your partner.
- You were supposed to come here and teach us.
- Teach us how to be a great spy couple.
- You really think we're that bad?
- Only because you were once great, yeah.
- We were great,  remember?
- Check back with me in 30 years, Charles.
- The CIA has a way of breaking young idealists.
- Especially if they're in love.
- Good, the marshals are here.
- It's Otto!
- And his pussycat.
- How, how did your good friend Otto find us?
- Did you two sell us out again?
- The collar has a tracking device.
- All right, where do you keep your backup g*n?
- Surely, you've heard of the 30-foot rule, Charles.
- Time to flash, time to flash.
- No g*n, no flash.
- Honey, darling, would you mind telling me what you've done with our small cache of w*apon? I got rid of them, sweetheart.
- You actually listened to me? I can't quite believe it myself.
- What have you done with the g*n that you had at the hotel? I left them in the car.
- Why would you... ? Because you told me to!
- Rookies. You take care of them I'll take care of Otto.
- You're making a big mistake.
- Hi, how you doing?
- Good Lord!
- Sorry to drop in on you like this.
- Sasha always feels at home wherever she goes.
- You don't mind if she looks around?
- What, uh, what-what-what's going on?
- Uh, who are you people?
- You know exactly who I am.
- The question is, who are you?
- Wait a minute. You're the guy!
- Baby, this is the guy with the mansion up in the hills!
- Oh, oh, I told you this would happen.
- I'm so sorry. My boyfriend thinks that it's really funny to crash rich people's parties.
- Where are the two CIA agents you're hiding?
- I'm sorry. What?
- I believe you know them as Mr. and Mrs. Turner.
- I'm a, I'm a little confused here.
- Why would CIA agents be in our apartment?
- Because this isn't a real apartment.
- This is a CIA safe house.
- And you two are not a real couple.
- You are spies.
- Ah!
- I'm on to you.
- This is a practical joke, isn't it?
- I bet this is from your brother.
- Okay, oh...
- You're a spy, honey. We're spies.
- Scary spies. You know what?
- I've always felt like I've got a James Bond-y thing going on about me. You do. You could be, like, uh, Octopussy or something like that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Now you're being really insulting.
- Listen, whoever you are, all I ask is that you hand over the Turners.
- You have until the count of drei.
- Eins, zwei...
- Stop. Please stop with the countdown.
- Ah, if I could just have a brief sidebar with my girlfriend, that would be great.
- Good. Thanks.
- These guys really take it seriously.
- This is very good, though. Very real.
- I say we hand them over. We can't do that.
- Why not? They sold us out.
- Because then we'd be no better than the Turners.
- Well, maybe they're right. Maybe we're going to end up just like them- a couple of traitors.
- Do you really believe that?
- No.
- I'm sorry, sir. Uh, but I-I really...
- I don't, I don't think we can help you.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Guard them.
- Uh, yeah, I don't think that kitty litter box is big enough.
- Good girl, Sasha.
- Take her outside.
- Sure you're all right? Yeah.
- Espionage wasn't my only aspiration.
- I mean, I could always join the competitive eating circuit.
- Well, dare to dream.
- The Turners are very clever.
- It appears your guests left in a hurry.
- This is unbelievable.
- The Turners have left us holding the bag again?
- I can assure you, this will be the last time.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Otto.
- Hold on a second. Clearly, The Turners have betrayed us both; that means that we're all on the same side here, so put your g*n down and let us help you hunt down those backstabbing bastards.
- They're the lowest of the low, okay?
- CIA scum.
- Let them go, Otto.
- But they're not without their moments.
- What the hell is this?
- Wh-What is it, Casey? What?
- Shh!
- It's a Bengal tiger.
- Female.
- Fully grown.
- Avoid eye contact.
- If she charges, make yourself as big as possible.
- Easy for you to say.
- It's us you want.
- We've got the software.
- What are you two doing?
- Showing you we're not traitors, Charles.
- What should we do?
- Shh! You're gonna get us k*ll.
- No.
- Listen to me. Listen to me. Just hear me out. Hear me out.
- This country needs men like you, Casey.
- Okay? What do I do?
- I sell refrigerators, you know? I mean, if I die, what?
- They'll shop at Large Mart. Big deal.
- But there is a way I can serve my country.
- What are you doing? I'm luring the tiger into Ellie and Awesome's apartment.
- You're not. Yes, I am, and listen to me. No matter what you hear in there, promise me you will not go in there after me.
- Semper fi-dizzle.
- Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty.
- Sasha.
- Oh! Okay.
- Did you see that? Told you I was good for something.
- Yeah. Move.
- We have to bring you in.
- You know I can't let you go.
- That's funny.
- I would have said the same thing 30 years ago.
- After what we did?
- You would have sh*t us dead where we stand.
- Which would be perfectly justifiable.
- And yet unnecessary.
- Wouldn't you agree, Sarah?
- They did save us.
- Sorry, darling.
- It's over.
- Good work, Team.
- Our cryptographers are analyzing Otto's software as we speak.
- Thanks to you, our nation's communications network remains secure.
- Thank you, General.
- And now, on to the subject of the Turners and their actions.
- Actually, General, if I might be able to say something on behalf of the Turners...
- General. No, Sarah. I think I...
- No, Chuck. It's okay. I got it.
- The Turner's double-cross was actually a triple-cross.
- By stealing the software from us, they were able to lure Otto into a trap, and we were able to capture him.
- It was a daring bit of spycraft.
- I would expect nothing less from the Turners.
- I just hope you and Agent Bartowski were able to learn something from these two exemplary operatives.
- As a matter of fact, General, yes, working with the Turners was... quite humbling.
- You must be ready to move on to your next assignment.
- Thanks but no thanks, General.
- E- Excuse me?
- No more assignments.
- What my husband means to say is, we're retiring.
- But you can't just walk away.
- You are the best of the best.
- Who will possibly take your place?
- You...
- Are you sure? Really?
- I mean, thank you.
- ♪ ♪
- Watch each other's backs, you two.
- And I wish you many happy marriages.
- ♪ ♪
- Please tell me that Chuck is joking about them sending me to boot camp.
- 'Cause, oh, man.
- They're gonna make me shave my beard.
- Hmm. Relax.
- You passed.
- Huh? I failed every test.
- With flying colors.
- You have got to be hands down, bar none the worst candidate I've ever trained.
- But you've got one thing going for you.
- You got balls.
- I do?
- How many Marines you know would go up against a Bengal tiger unarmed? Yeah.
- You'd have to be a complete idiot.
- Well, that's the thing. You know...
- That's, that's me in a nutshell.
- Lesser men, they'd run away from danger, and I'm, uh. .
- Casey?
- Dude.
- You turned my sister's apartment into a kitty litter box.
- I know. I'm sorry, man.
- I just... How was I supposed to know the tiger wasn't housebroken?
- Oh, my God.
- Great. You're here.
- Guys, we got to get this place fixed up before Devon and Ellie get back.
- Well, actually, I was gonna start with our place.
- Our place?
- That is, if your offer for me to move in still stands?
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry that I freaked out when you asked me to move in with you.
- It's just, you know how I grew up.
- I spent my life living in hotel rooms under fake names.
- I've been trained to survive a thousand different situations in the field, but nobody ever taught me how to have a normal life.
- Well, I hate to break it to you, but I don't think we're ever going to live a normal life.
- Well, I'd like to have something to fall back on when our spy life is over.
- Devon, sweetie, where are you?
- Devon?
- Baby?
- Ah, baby, you're burning up.
- I'll be right back. Help!
- Sorry, El.
- I thought we could do some good work here.
- You do not apologize.
- Now it's my job to take care of you, okay?
- Thank you.
- I alerted the airport.
- There's an ambulance waiting for you, so you can skip customs and drive straight onto the tarmac. Thank you.
- Your husband's going to be fine.
- I know, I know.
- I just can't believe we're leaving so soon.
- There are plenty of ways you can help back home.
- Take care.
- All right. Feel better.
- They just left.
- I took care of the husband.
- Made it look like malaria.
- She doesn't suspect a thing.
