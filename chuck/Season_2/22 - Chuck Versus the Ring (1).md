# Chuck Versus the Ring (1)

- Hi. I'm Chuck. Here's a few things you might need to know.
- I programmed it to remove the Intersect from Chuck's head.
- It's over, Chuck. The Intersect is out.
- You're a spy, Chuck?
- Yeah, more or less, yeah.
- Awesome!
- Don't you have a dream, Morgan?
- I'd like to be a Benihana chef.
- Morgan out.
- You're free, Morgan!
- Chuck, where have you been?
- I was getting your wedding present.
- Dad...
- Where're you headed?
- Burbank.
- Got a wedding to go to.
- Hmm, thank you for joining us.
- Emmett, I've waited a long time for this day.
- Thought of so many ways I could say it out loud and how it'd finally feel to get it off of my chest.
- Let me stop you, Chuck.
- I am incredibly flattered.
- But I am a flaming heterosexual.
- What?
- What?
- No, no, I'm, I'm, I'm out of here.
- I'm, I'm done.
- Well, leaving is not the answer.
- I am just touched that you are taking it so hard.
- Emmett, you don't understand!
- I quit!
- No more Buy More.
- No more you.
- You can take your flag and your job and shove it.
- Ditto.
- Just what do you think you're gonna do for the rest of your life? !
- Anything I want.
- Chuck,  what are your plans for the future?
- Well, I was gonna get a good champagne buzz going on at my sister's wedding followed by a nice extra-long slow dance with my date.
- Vocationally speaking?
- Oh, that, no, nothing, nothing lined up just yet.
- How would you feel about working on the new Intersect project?
- Your government has been rebuilding its own Intersect.
- You've shown real promise.
- We'd like you to be an analyst.
- Your country is calling you, Mr. Bartowski.
- Uh, well, then I think my country might have the wrong number, 'cause I'm just Chuck Bartowski, not a hero.
- Very well.
- I guess that concludes Project Bartowski.
- Colonel Casey, please issue Mr. Bartowski his final papers before you and your Special Forces team ship out to Waziristan.
- Agent Walker, I'll need you for just a moment more.
- What exactly is this?
- It's your pay packet, numbnuts.
- Hi-yo! Whoa!
- Yeah, you know, if you were a true patriot, you wouldn't even cash it.
- Casey?
- Hmm?
- Thank you for saving my life at least once a week. Hmm.
- See?
- Guys can hug.
- Not if they don't have their man parts.
- That's a good point.
- You've done good work here.
- Thank you.
- It's in case of emergencies.
- My personal number, but, uh, your fingers better be on fire when you're dialing.
- Agent Walker,
- I'm sure you'll be pleased to know you're in charge of the new Intersect project, working in tandem with Agent Larkin.
- And this time, the Intersect goes in my head.
- Bryce?
- Now that we've got the Cube, it's ready for upload.
- You leave for Zurich together at 0800.
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Walker and Larkin... together again.
- Finally, you can get out of here.

- Hey.
- Hey.
- Everything is going to be perfect.
- I even had your Toyota washed for you, man.
- Oh, perfect, thanks, bro.
- Oh, uh, I'll be right back.
- Okay.
- Just a second.
- Hi, can I talk to my sister?
- It will only take a second.
- Oh, no, Chuck.
- It's bad luck to see the bride...
- It's fine, I don't believe in that stuff.
- All right, just get in, get in.
- Get in, get in!
- Hi.
- What?
- Look at you.
- Ellie, your dreams are coming true.
- If it were up to me, I would have a small ceremony on a beach.
- Sand between my toes, people I love.
- But we all make sacrifices for family, right?
- One, two, three...
- Where the hell is my blonde?
- Anyway, uh...
- I don't know exactly yet what I'm going to get you for your wedding present.
- But I'll start with this: I quit the Buy More today.
- What? !
- The Buy More is no more.
- Oh, Chuck, that is... that is incredible.
- What are you going to do with your future?
- I don't know.
- Oh, there she is!
- I made my dreams come true, Chuck.
- What are you gonna do about yours?
- Sarah, can we talk for a moment?
- Look, I wanted to tell...
- Oh, uh...
- Ellie wanted me to make sure that you have the rings.
- Yeah, right.
- You look like a real spy.
- You look like a real bridesmaid.
- Sarah, I...
- Wait, uh...
- There's something that I have to tell you.
- I can't wait.
- I can't wait, I can't wait any longer.
- Okay, everyone keeps asking me what I'm going to do with my future, and the truth is, I don't have a clue.
- All I do know is that I want you to be in it.
- Please, I really have to tell you.
- No.
- No g*n, no lies, just us.
- Just like I've always wanted it.
- I've recently come into a little bit of money.
- So, any place you want to go, any place at all as long as it's sunny, with little umbrella drinks.
- What I'm getting at here is...
- Sarah Walker, will you do me the honor of taking a vacation with me?
- Chuck, I'm leaving in the morning.
- The details are classified but I'm working on the new Intersect project with Bryce.
- Bryce.
- I-I'm so sorry.
- I wanted to wait until after the ceremony to tell you.
- Thank you for coming to the wedding.
- Good for the cover.
- Today's a day we'll remember forever, son.
- Oh, my God!
- I believe we've met before.
- Ted Roark.
- No, I'm Ted Roark.
- You're the CIA agent who's in deep trouble.
- By the way, congratulations on your sister's happy day.
- Her gown is gorgeous.
- Full bodice, love the beading.
- What the hell do you want?
- Ooh, there's no need to curse.
- You know damn well what I want.
- I...
- I want the Intersect Cube.
- I-I can't, I can't, I can't give you that.
- Oh, you'll find a way, I'm sure.
- Oh, sorry, I forgot the threat part.
- If you don't deliver that Cube within a half hour, 40 minutes tops with traffic, I'm going to k*ll the bride.
- Nice.
- Hey, Chuck.
- Sorry, can I talk to you real quick?
- I'm just feeling a little nervous.
- Buddy, I'm so sorry, I can't talk right now.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- What's the matter?
- You could tell me, I... I might be able to help.
- It's, uh... It's, uh...
- It's the rings.
- It's the rings. I have to go home and get them.
- Find Sarah, pull her aside, and specifically tell her that I forgot the rings.
- The wedding is in 20 minutes. Ellie is gonna k*ll you.
- Thanks for that.
- Unless...
- I stall the wedding.
- Okay, no one will even know you're gone.
- They'll just blame me. It'll be fine.
- You'd do that for me?
- Of course I would, dude.
- You've saved my ass a million times.
- It's about time I saved yours.
- But go.
- Oh!
- What is that smell?
- There he is!
- Ladies.
- You ladies get soft without me?
- It's been a while. Good to see you, sir.
- Yeah, a long time, Miles...
- Come on, Casey.
- This is Casey. Leave a message.
- Who's ready to do some hunting?
- Hurrah! Hurrah!
- Dr. Awesome.
- Don't take another step.
- My wife warned me about you.
- Good warnings, I hope.
- Retreat two steps back.
- I need to get in there.
- You...
- Oh, uh, Dr. Woodcomb, your wife wants me to tell you to go to the car and get backup hosiery.
- Does that make sense?
- Man my post. Don't let this one in.
- Yes, sir.
- Sarah, listen to me.
- Uh, Chuck forgot the rings, so he-he went home to go get them.
- He what?
- Yeah, the wedding rings. He blew it.
- I have to stall the wedding.
- How do I stall a wedding?
- Uh, do it, Morgan, by any means necessary.
- Right, right.
- How the hell do I stall this wedding?
- Think, man, think.
- It's gone.
- Bryce?
- To the new Intersect.
- Where? Where? Where is it? !
- Chuck, you know I can't tell you that.
- That's top secret. Not even Beckman...
- No, I need it, Bryce. I need it. My family's in danger.
- Ted Roark and his FULCRUM team are at the wedding.
- He's going to k*ll Ellie unless I bring him the Cube.
- Roark can't have it.
- No.
- He'll m*rder everyone.
- No. You're going to give them me.
- They think you're the Intersect.
- They've been looking for me all along.
- The Cube can't fall into the wrong hands.
- I made a promise to Orion.
- You knew.
- That was the deal.
- Your dad knew I protected you at Stanford.
- I was the only spy he would trust.
- I can't believe you've known this whole time.
- He wanted to keep you out of this.
- But I knew you could handle the Intersect, I knew Sarah would find you, and most importantly, you deserved to know the truth about your father.
- He's a hero.
- Now, let's go get your sister married.
- Yeah, just...
- What's the holdup?
- Uh, the bride is perfect.
- She'll only wilt from here.
- Oh, we can't find Chuck.
- Oh, and the blonde is gone, too.
- Sarah?
- Yeah.
- Just now?
- Yes.
- Excuse me.
- This is a really weird family.
- Don't chew gum.
- Sarah?
- Something's wrong.
- Ted Roark and his men are inside.
- He's alive?
- How did... ?
- Did you bring a g*n?
- I'll think of something.
- Please, check the chapel and the bridal chamber.
- Make sure there's nobody else.
- Wait.
- Use the South East entrance, through the kitchen.
- Okay, thanks.
- Hello.
- It's on? It's on?
- Hello.
- Uh, I-I'm Morgan Grimes, unofficial member of the wedding party.
- Uh, so, uh, we have some pre-wedding entertainment planned for you guys.
- So, without further ado, I present to you Jeffster!
- It's Jeffster!
- What's going on?
- I don't know, but this wedding just got good.
- Dude, we got the perfect song.
- Knock 'em dead. Knock 'em dead.
- Okay, this is in four/four time.
- It's in D.
- Watch me for the changes.
- Morgan, you are ruining my wedding!
- Listen to me. If you hit me, know that it only teaches me to hit.
- Okay, now for reasons I cannot say, I have to stall this wedding.
- Tell me why.
- Because Chuck is in trouble, and I'm saving him, man.
- Chuck told you to do this?
- Yes.
- Okay, okay, I'm with you.
- Okay, no Sarah.
- And that is definitely not the wedding march.
- Um, can one of you please go see what's going on out there?
- Now! Thank you. Thank you.
- Focus on the calm.
- Kevin, why are you letting Sam Kinison and an Indian lesbian wreck your wedding?
- Dad, just chill out, okay?
- Come on.
- You know what?
- I'm feeling a bit peckish.
- Don't you dare!
- Chuck.
- If you ever want to see the Intersect again, you will not touch anything in this room.
- Do I make myself clear?
- Today is my sister's wedding day, and believe me, you don't want to see her angry.
- Where's the Intersect, Chuck?
- Uh, a-about that...
- k*ll him.
- Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
- Ho down. Ho down. I mean, hold on.
- Just hold on a second, all right?
- Finally.
- I did bring an Intersect with me.
- An Intersect?
- Mr. Roark.
- Mr. Larkin.
- The Human Intersect.
- Roark, you want me.
- Now let Chuck and his people go.
- We leave, they stay, nobody else needs to know.
- Terrific plan.
- Thing of it is, FULCRUM wants Chuck here dead no matter what.
- So, with that said, sh**t Mr. Bartowski, or...
- Sarah, take him.
- Oh, God, not the flowers!
- Not the centerpieces.
- I'm dry. Any more knives?
- Nope. I threw all eight.
- Get up!
- Okay.
- Oh, God.
- Someone just sh**t me now.
- I can help you with that, Chuck.
- Mm.
- A real g*n wedding.
- Just think, that terrible pun is the last thing you'll ever hear.
- Hello, Ted.
- Waited 20 years to do that.
- All clear, sir.
- You rang.
- Chuck.
- What happened?
- Uh, everything's all right, Ellie.
- There was just a minor centerpiece problem.
- Oh, no.
- Wedding canceled.
- This is officially a disaster.
- I can't believe that my spy life has wrecked my real life.
- Again.
- I've completely ruined my sister's wedding day.
- I'm sorry, son. I...
- If anyone knows how you feel, it's me.
- You had no choice, Charles.
- You saved her life.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You okay?
- No, I'm not.
- I'm not okay.
- I don't want to have to save my sister using a Special Forces team.
- I just want to be a normal guy who helps his sister in normal ways.
- Like right now, if I could give her anything in the world, I would...
- Excuse me.
- I think I might know how to fix this.
- You got time for one more mission before you take off?
- It's not what a normal guy would do.
- Don't forget to lock it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Walker, what is it?
- You're kidding.
- Roger that. We're on it.
- Ellie, are you all right?
- Chuck, just please go away.
- I can't believe your idiot friends ruined my wedding.
- I'm just-- I'm never going to forgive Morgan for this.
- Well, I think you're going to have to.
- Because Morgan... and Lester, and Jeff-- they only did what I asked them to do.
- What?
- I did all this.
- I forgot your rings.
- So I told them to stall.
- So if you're going to be mad at someone, you should be mad at me.
- Please say something.
- You... ruined... the most important day of my life.
- Look...
- Ellie, you have to trust me, okay.
- Take these... and I'll take care of the rest.
- Trust me.
- Sir, how do you spell begonia?
- Sound it out.
- No, no, no, that clashes with the bunting.
- Yes, I-I appreciate that you require extra time to permit the area, but this is a national security matter.
- We are gathered here to join together
- Eleanor Faye Bartowski and Devon Christian Woodcomb in matrimony.
- Who gives this woman in marriage to this man?
- We do.
- We do.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Watch him.
- A partnership should not be entered into lightly, but with much consideration.
- If any person can show just cause why they should not be joined, let them speak now or forever hold their peace.
- Sarah.
- You're not coming with me, are you?
- Do you have the rings?
- Whoo!
- Was that... you were talking about, secondhand smoke?
- Three hundred.
- Sir.
- Roark wants to talk to you.
- Watch my cards.
- Watch them.
- Better not be about food.
- Don't!
- Sorry, sir.
- We've been through a lot.
- How long you been FULCRUM?
- I'm not with FULCRUM.
- Go ahead and pull the trigger.
- I don't want to look at your face.
- You just k*ll three Marines in cold bl*od.
- Yeah.
- But none of them saved my life.
- Hi.
- Thank you.
- For what?
- For what? For-for all of this.
- For my wedding gift.
- This is...
- I don't how you did all this.
- Well, I can't exactly take all the credit.
- Well, first the beach and now this.
- I don't know.
- You're pretty amazing, little brother.
- Sometimes I think you have super powers.
- I wish.
- I know.
- Chuck, man, you saved the day.
- Looks like you're the big hero.
- Thanks, bro.
- Well, now I really am your bro.
- Yes, you are.
- I can't believe you're actually leaving me.
- All right, don't, Chuck.
- I'll cry. We don't want that now, do we?
- I'm happy for you, buddy.
- I think that you are going to be the greatest Hibachi chef in the world.
- I don't know, man. This whole...
- "making your dreams come true thing" is hard.
- And the bigger the dream, the harder it gets.
- You know, on one side, you know, the girl you love.
- And then on the other, life as you know it.
- It's just, you know, friends and family, and job you can't stand.
- I don't know, man.
- I should just go with Anna, right?
- But then I, uh... I'm overthinking this, aren't I?
- Yeah, yeah, you are.
- Go with your heart, buddy.
- Our brains only screw things up.
- Where's Bryce?
- Gone.
- They're uploading him with the new computer tonight.
- Off to save the world.
- I guess both of you are.
- You want to dance?
- You know I do.
- Mr. Bartowski.
- Or is this an Orion conversation?
- A bit of both.
- I reconfigured the Cube for you under two conditions: You stop looking for me, and you leave my son alone.
- We asked Chuck to be on my team. He said no.
- Good-bye, Orion.
- You made changes-- to the Intersect.
- To my initial designs.
- The data architecture is different.
- What does this new computer do?
- You don't want to know.
- Agent Larkin.
- It's time to go.
- You belong out there, saving the world.
- I'm just...
- I'm just not that guy.
- How many times do you have to be a hero to realize that you are that guy?
- But I want more, Sarah.
- I want a life.
- I want a real life.
- Chuck, I don't want to save the world.
- I want...
- Chuck, the agent... the agent who came for Bryce... he isn't a CIA agent.
- He's supposed to be dead.
- Dad, how could you possibly know that?
- Screw it.
- I... I have an Intersect in my head.
- I... I tested the computer on myself.
- I was young and stupid, but the intel was good.
- That man isn't CIA.
- Bryce.
- Bryce is getting the upload tonight.
- They're going to k*ll him.
- They'll download the Intersect into their team instead.
- Well, if they know about Bryce, they know about Casey.
- Sarah...
- Let her go, son.
- You've done your part.
- No, I have to go.
- No... no, you don't.
- You're not a spy.
- Dad...
- I love her.
- I can't follow you, son, but take this.
- Thank you.
- Be safe, Charles.
- Thank you.
- Hey, I'm coming with you.
- Stay here-- it's not your mission.
- Wait... this is the Interect we're talking about, and I'm a Bartowski.
- You need me.
- Let's go.
- Did you see her?
- Agent Walker?
- She was amazing, right?
- Yes, sir.
- She loves another guy.
- Bad day to be me.
- You have no idea.
- Mr. Larkin.
- Open this door!
- They're already here.
- Bryce must be in the vault!
- Chuck, go get help.
- Help!
- Hello, Chuck.
- Bryce.
- Bryce, Casey and Sarah are pinned down outside.
- I'm on it.
- Oh, my God... oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, you've been sh*t.
- Yeah.
- I'm really sorry about this, Chuck.
- No.
- No, it's okay... it's okay.
- You're going to be fine-- it's not that bad.
- Take care of her.
- Don't... don't say that.
- You're not dying.
- She needs you, man, okay?
- You... you guys are going to go on missions together and do exciting things and save the world.
- You'll be a team again-- it will be great.
- She wasn't going to come.
- She wants...
- Come on.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- This will destroy the Intersect.
- This new computer is too powerful.
- It's too dangerous.
- But you need... you need the computer to fight FULCRUM.
- FULCRUM doesn't matter, all right?
- They... they're just... they're just one part of the Ring.
- They'll use it against us, Chuck.
- You have to do this.
- All right?
- You have to destroy that computer, and then get out of here.
- Yeah, but you can b*at them.
- You're a real... hero, Bryce.
- Bryce.
- Oh, my God.
- I can't figure out why Bryce did this, why he chose me.
- You can do anything-- I've seen you in action.
- You can't put him out in the field.
- He won't survive.
- It's time for you to become a spy.
- I'm just Chuck Bartowski, not a hero.
- How many times do you have to be a hero to realize that you are that guy?
- What did you do?
- What did you do? !
- I destroyed it.
- You're too late.
- For that, you'll die last.
- Bryce.
- Bryce!
- Bryce, no... help me.
- No, don't you touch him!
- There's nothing left.
- So, you lose.
- You should know this.
- No one stops us.
- No one ever has.
- Who are you?
- Spies, Agent Walker.
- The best.
- Sir, you should look at this.
- Chuck, did you just flash?
- He uploaded it.
- Oh, Chuck me.
- k*ll him.
- Chuck?
- Guys... I know kung fu.
