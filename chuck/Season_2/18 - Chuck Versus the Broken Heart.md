# Chuck Versus the Broken Heart

- Freeze! Drop him.
- Take your masks off.
- Do it!
- Untie him.
- Stay still.
- Stay still, hold still, hold still.
- Man up, Charles.
- Why would you do this to me? Sorry, man, it was a practice run for when we kidnap Awesome for his bachelor party.
- You guys aren't even invited!
- Right, right, what finer way to be invited than to kidnap the guest of honor?
- A bachelor party is a mythical place where booze and women are free.
- It's Xanadu.
- Oh, my God!
- Stop it! Stop it!
- You... stop it!
- Okay, I'm going to bed.
- What the heck? !
- Chuck?
- Bartowski?
- General! Hey.
- What are you, what are you...
- I wanted a private word with you.
- Pardon the intrusion.
- On this moment?
- Or on my life in general?
- I'd like to know if your relationship with Agent Walker is compromising your job performance.
- How do you mean? What does that mean?
- Has your situation gotten too complicated?
- What? With, with Sarah?
- No, God, no.
- No, Sarah Walker is a pleasure to work with.
- A delight, even.
- I want facts, I don't care about your feelings.
- What feelings? These feelings: Sarah, you want to go on a date with me? A real date?
- Sarah, you're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.
- I guess I wouldn't mind time to sort out my feelings.
- My mother's charm bracelet.
- My dad gave it to her.
- I'm crazy about you and always have been.
- My job is to make sure you're protected without interloping emotional complications from my team.
- We're going to have to do a 49-B.
- Okay, if you could just tell me what a 49-B is that would help...
- Chuckster.
- Time to flush out your system, dude.
- Oh. Oh, God.
- No, I'm good with my clog.
- Hey, about your bachelor party, do you still want to do that camping thing or, uh, do you want to do something more traditional, or... ? Hey.
- Chuck, uh, this came back in the mail for you.
- It's from Dad.
- I'm so sorry, Ellie.
- I'll keep searching.
- You know what? Don't worry about it.
- You can't get disappointed if you don't have expectations, right?
- So, um, I was overhearing about the bachelor party.
- For the record, I don't care what you guys do, because I trust you completely.
- Which is why I'm marrying you.
- What is that?
- That is the taste of a healthy colon.
- Who's General Beckman? What?
- Video game stuff. Yeah, it's video game stuff.
- It's top-secret vide game stuff that I-I, you know, I'd be breaking all kinds of rules to talk about it.
- Morgan, huh? Yeah.
- So if Morgan's General Beckman, who are you?
- Uh, well...
- I am Special Agent Carmichael.
- Carmichael. I like it.
- Sarah. Hey, Sarah, I messed up. General Beckman, she called me, asked me about our relationship.
- And, you know that conversation, the one where I might've maybe mentioned that I'm crazy about you.
- Well, I tried to cover it, but I'm not so sure that she bought it.
- Wha-- where's Sarah?
- I'm Agent Alex Forrest.
- General Beckman sent me.
- I'm your 49-B.
- For the Chuck team I'm sure you've all had a chance to welcome Agent Alex Forrest.
- Of course, General.
- Then onto the matter at hand.
- We're all familiar with the elusive leader of a t\*rror1st group who has been hiding in the Afghani caves for years: Hassan Khalid.
- I dream of finding him.
- A member of Khalid's inner circle is this man: Rashad Ahmad.
- Ahmad is privy to all of Khalid's nefarious plans.
- While on banking business for Khalid in Los Angeles, a man we believe to be Ahmad had a heart attack.
- He needs a pacemaker and has checked into a hospital under the pseudonym: Harry Lime.
- You believe this man to be Ahmad?
- That is the mission.
- Intelligence has only been able to obtain grainy satellite images of Ahmad.
- Mr. Bartowski, using his unique k\*ll set, must infiltrate the hospital to confirm Ahmad's identity.
- Questions? Sounds straightforward, General.
- Yeah, I have a question.
- Yeah, I have a question. Just a teeny little one.
- What exactly is a 49-B?
- Mind fielding that one, Agent Walker?
- Agent Forrest is here to assess my performance.
- And during my evaluation period, she will assume the role of the asset's handler.
- Thank you.
- That will be all.
- What?
- What is this all about?
- I'm sorry, to discuss this further would be a breach of protocol.
- "To discuss this further would be a breach of protocol"?
- Is it possible that someone kidnapped Sarah and replaced her with some kind of soulless replica? Let me guess.
- You want to talk about your feelings, Bartowski?
- Please. Wrong!
- That's what got the 49-B involved in the first place.
- How could... Chuck.
- All right, buddy, we are here to plead our case about Awesome's bachelor party. You know what?
- Not now, guys, I'm right in the middle of something.
- The world revolves around the sun, Charles, not you.
- Ooh, astronomy snap.
- Okay. It's just that-- we just-- we'd like you to reconsider.
- Reconsider what? You guys aren't even invited!
- You tell him or I will.
- Jeff and I... we've never been to a bachelor party.
- Never known anyone qualified enough to land a woman for life.
- So, please, please. Please, please.
- Please... No and no.
- Okay, how about this? As a plus, since Big Mike has been dating my mother, he's made me lock up.
- So, we can use this place for the party, save a little cash and guess what?
- Spend it on lady dancers.
- Pow!
- Lady dancers. Pow.
- Hey now. Hey now.
- We're talking serious... The answer's no.
- Hey... Oh, please.
- Don't-don't say no.
- Say you'll wrap your mind around it.
- Hey, does the new girl know about, uh...
- No.
- She won't know that top secret information unless her position becomes permanent.
- What, what do you mean permanent?
- It's not going to happen.
- The 49-B will come in, make her findings and be on her way.
- Hey, uh, I'm sorry, Sarah.
- For what?
- I didn't mean to get you in trouble at work 'cause I told you my feelings. I didn't know I was being taped that much. No, it's fine.
- Really. I've just been kind of stressed out lately.
- You know, I promised Ellie that I'd find our dad to walk her down the aisle, but I've tried everything; he's nowhere.
- It's like he's fallen off the face of the earth.
- Hey, you've got clearance.
- You mind running my dad's name through the big Castle computer?
- That's impossible.
- Damn right.
- If Agent Walker did that, not only would she be fired but potentially face charges of misappropriation of government intelligence.
- Enough personal time.
- We have work to do.
- The asset and I will enter the facility,  obtain uniforms to assimilate and attempt to confirm Ahmad's identity.
- Is there anything I can do, Casey?
- I got it.
- Casey, uh, what is that?
- You confirm Harry Lime is Ahmad, I'll sneak into the hospital's high-security area where the equipment and donor organs are kept.
- Why? Aren't we just gonna arrest him?
- Don't underestimate the gamesmanship of the U. S. Government.
- Yeah, I'll place this GLG-4000 inside Ahmad's pacemaker before it's implanted.
- When he returns to Hassan Khalid's secret cave, he'll be a high-tech human bug.
- Then not only will we know the t\*rrorists' secret location, but we'll be one step ahead of their plans.
- Checkmate. Checkmate.
- Get the door.
- Are you guys crazy?
- I can't go in here. This is the hospital where Ellie and Awesome work.
- It's okay. We checked their schedules.
- Ellie's not working today. Devon is mid-surgery.
- Hey, you're here to observe.
- Stay in the van, Walker. That's an order.
- And what were you little kids doing in there?
- A little hanky-panky?
- What? Why?
- Why would you do that?
- Relax, I only tranqed her.
- She'll be awake six to eight hours.
- Now grab a leg.
- Oh, hey!
- I didn't think you were on call today, Dr. Bartowski.
- Yeah, well, they keep switching my shifts around.
- See you.
- You know, that grandma was no threat to us.
- I don't get why you decided... I don't decide.
- Protocol dictates my actions.
- Chuck... your sister is 30 feet northeast of you.
- Doctor...
- Yeah?
- You forgot your pen. Oh.
- Now or never.
- See you.
- It's him.
- Are you his doctor?
- Of course.
- Am I not wearing a doctor's coat?
- Who else would I be if not one of this man's doctors?
- Doctor, I am Harry Lime's private physician, Dr. Mohammed Zamir.
- Ah. Doctor.
- Doctor. Doctor.
- Doctor. And Doctor.
- Nurse, would you excuse us for a moment, please?
- I'd like to consult the doctor privately, please.
- Yes, yes, we will be discussing doctor things that only doctors understand.
- Please go.
- Please don't go.
- Be right outside... Doctor.
- Major, what's your 20?
- In position.
- Identification affirmative.
- Roger that. Proceed.
- Hey!
- You! Yeah?
- Hysterectomy in 806 didn't make it to the toilet.
- You mind?
- You got it.
- Well, heart sounds appear to be normal.
- For a patient with this type of atypical cardio-cardiac condition.
- You should know that this patient is a very important man.
- Well, I... I took an oath to treat my first patient with the same kind of care as every subsequent patient.
- It's a very dangerous job to be the surgeon of a very important man.
- You understand my meaning, Doctor?
- I'll do the best job that I know how to do.
- Your life depends on it.
- If I have to eat an apple a day to keep that doctor away,  then bring on the fresh fruit.
- Hey.
- Security system has been updated.
- I'll either need 40 minutes to decrypt the code or four ounces of C-4.
- Or you could just take out some doctor and steal his card key.
- I like the cut of your jib.
- Wow, you two are a match made in a very frightening part of Heaven.
- Now, all we'll need is some idiot doctor with a key card to get us into the restricted area.
- No way.
- No, no way, absolutely not.
- No, uh-uh, I am not getting my soon-to-be brother-in-law involved in a government spy mission-- no way.
- Fortunately, you, like felons and children, don't get a vote.
- Is there a different doctor we can access?
- This mission does put Chuck's cover close to the action, risking potential exposure.
- And boom-- the words I was thinking just came out of Sarah's mouth.
- Connected professionally.
- No time, Bartowski.
- Only a couple docs have that card key.
- Your sister's Ken doll is one of them.
- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You can't just walk up to Awesome and ask for it.
- I'll handle things my way.
- No, wait, wait, wait!
- There will be no tranqing... no tranqing.
- I think I might know how we can have our spy cake and eat it, too.
- What the...
- What are you doing?
- Surprise!
- You guys are awesome.
- To the bachelor!
- What are you doing?
- Visual souvenirs, dude.
- He does quite a bit of scrapbooking.
- You got to be kidding me.
- Listen to me, guys.
- What happens in the Buy More... stays in the Buy More.
- Oh, right.
- Yes, no, I-I got it.
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- Bachelor party virgin.
- Lock it down.
- Okay, okay.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Uh... happy bachelor party there, Captain.
- Well, thanks for all your help throwing it, General Beckman.
- Nothing gets by me.
- Okay.
- Based on my observations, Agent Walker is far too emotionally entwined with the asset.
- Her decisions weren't made with respect to established protocol.
- She always places the subject's feelings above orders.
- Is that your final assessment, Agent Forrest?
- It is.
- Agent Walker.
- Thank you for your dedication to this mission.
- General, please, I...
- But as of right now, your services are officially terminated.
- Report back to Langley at 0900.
- Please take good care of him.
- I'll do my job, if that's what you mean.
- Well, I'll be on my way as soon as I say good-bye to him.
- I don't think so.
- You've already done enough damage here.
- Chuck's my mission now.
- No further contact.
- That's an order.
- To finding the love of your life.
- Hey!
- Happy bachelor party, my friend.
- We got you half a dozen five-dollar foot-longs from Subway.
- That's six feet o' meat.
- Five-- I ate a foot.
- What is the matter with you?
- Thanks, boys.
- Gonna be quite a tasty event.
- Thank you.
- Here we go, gentlemen.
- See, this is what I'm talking about.
- He's going to be so drunk when you steal his card key, he won't even notice.
- No tranqing necessary.
- And how are we gonna distract him?
- Oh, I'm one step ahead of you, my friend.
- I had Jeff hire some exotic female entertainment.
- At least the sandwiches are fresh.
- Wait, Jeffrey.
- Isn't that your sister?
- She gave us a deal.
- Hello?
- Hey, babe, it's me.
- Chuck and the boys kidnapped me for my bachelor party.
- Wow, lucky you.
- I am lucky, knowing what's waiting for me at home.
- Hey... great party, huh?
- That's very charming for a man who's so close to temptation.
- How could I be tempted by a hamburger when I have steak at home?
- Seriously, babe, I love you.
- All right, you've sucked up enough.
- I trust you.
- Have fun.
- Thanks, honey.
- Got Woodcomb's wallet, but came up empty.
- No card key.
- Must still be around his neck.
- We'll have to get it another way.
- Don't worry.
- Got a backup plan.
- You're still here, Walker.
- I thought I made myself clear.
- I'm just tying up some loose ends.
- Make it quick.
- Freeze, boys.
- You're all in trouble.
- Five-O.
- Got to flush my stash.
- No, no, Jeff, no, this is what you've been waiting for.
- This... is Xanadu.
- I understand one of you has been a naughty, naughty boy.
- Me... oh, my God, pick me.
- I'm so bad, I've been bad, I'm a bad person.
- I'm a terrible person-- ouch.
- I broke eight and a half commandments on the way to work this morning.
- This is your guy.
- This is him.
- I'm going to have to strip-search you.
- Uh, help.
- No, no, no.
- A little help here?
- No, no, you're under arrest.
- I can't help you.
- This is the law, this is the law.
- We're not going to go against the law.
- Be gentle with him.
- Oh, my.
- Are you kidding me?
- Listen, I know the guys probably put you up to this, but we really don't have to be alone in here.
- Oh, my...
- Wait... hey.
- Why don't you just take this off?
- That way, nothing's going to come between us.
- I can't.
- I lose it, I, uh... I get fired.
- Uh, no, no, no, hold on.
- Hold on, stop.
- Stop.
- I love my fiancée.
- I would never do anything to jeopardize that.
- Guess romance is alive and well and living in Burbank.
- No, no, no!
- I said no tranqing!
- That is not no tranqing!
- Can't you keep your stinking CIA darts out of people?
- Good work.
- Now I can access the restricted area and plant the bug before Ahmad's surgery.
- Be sure and sell it for the friends.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, have I no rights?
- You can't just go around willy-nilly knocking out my family members.
- Looks like we can.
- Sarah never would've done this.
- You've gone too far.
- Back off, Bartowski. What are you gonna do about it?
- I'm calling the General, that's what.
- Is that so? No one's calling anyone.
- Listen, this 49-B stuff is over.
- From now on, the only person I work with is Sarah.
- Walker's gone; she's been dismissed.
- What?
- What are you talking about?
- I'm your new handler.
- With the use of Dr. Woodcomb's card key, Major Casey entered the hospital's restricted area and planted the GLG-4000 on Ahmad's pacemaker.
- General Beckman?
- One moment, Mr. Bartowski.
- Turn up the volume.
- That is the sound of success.
- General?
- Soon Ahmad and his men will be on their way back to Khalid's Afghani hideout, and we can begin our covert surveillance in earnest.
- General, look, I understand that this is an important mission, I do. But what about Sarah?
- How can she be gone just like that?
- It's the way it is, Bartowski.
- No, why didn't you tell me that this could happen with a 49-B? !
- I was under the impression that Agent Forrest was here just to evaluate Sarah.
- You lied to me!
- Come on, it's a job, Chuck.
- No, for you, it's a job.
- For me, it's my life.
- We disclosed everything that was pertinent to you.
- That's the way the National Security Agency operates.
- Get used to it.
- I'm gonna go clean my w\*apon.
- When it comes to security, one can never be too cautious.
- Who is Rashad's doctor? !
- One of the surgeons put a bug inside him.
- Dr. Devon Woodcomb.
- You two go bring me the doctor.
- When the doctor woke up this morning, he didn't know that today...
- I'm gonna die.
- Oh, my God, I'm going to die. I would love to feel sorry for you, honey, but I think you kind of brought this one on yourself.
- How'd I get so wasted?
- I don't remember a thing.
- Well, you drank a little bit, you cut loose, no harm done. I remember our lovely neighbor, John Casey, carrying you home at 4:00 in the morning, smelling like booze and cheap hairspray.
- Does that ring a bell for you?
- Honey, I mean, please don't say the word bell.
- Honey? Huh?
- Did I have my key card on me last night?
- What?
- Did you take my key card off me or not?
- No, I didn't take your key card off.
- I'm sure it's here somewhere.
- Oh, God.
- It's always around your neck, under your shirt.
- Whdid your shirt come off?
- Well, do you want to tell me if your pants stayed on? !
- Ellie, please, will you just help me look for the key card?
- Guys, guys, it'll turn up, I just know it.
- You know, I'm, I'm really sorry that you don't remember what happened last night.
- I hope whatever it was, it was worth it.
- Dude, I wish I had a do-over for last night.
- I'd take it all back.
- Can you believe Walker?
- What about her?
- Getting all wrapped up in the asset?
- Clearly her feelings have jeopardized your missions.
- You must be relieved that she's gone.
- Things can now finally be professional.
- Agent Forrest, for the record...
- Either something's wrong with our equipment...
- Or something's wrong with Ahmad.
- Hey, Casey, it's me.
- Look, uh, we got to get Awesome his key card back or he's going to be in big trouble.
- We must find this doctor at once.
- Which one is his apartment?
- What are we going to do with the doctor?
- That is up to the boss.
- Awesome, Awesome.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Woodcomb, can... ?
- Government issue.
- Doesn't make any...
- This...
- Oh, my God, it smells like Heaven.
- Okay, that means either someone is baking sugar cookies or that is...
- I need to ask you a favor.
- Anything, anything-- you can have my firstborn.
- I need to know what happened last night at Devon's bachelor party.
- Come on, El, you can't ask me that.
- There's a bro code.
- Please, Morgan.
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- I have to lock it down.
- I just-- that's what I-- but listen to me, I...
- Oh, my God.
- I know.
- Can you believe our first bachelor party was so freaking awes--?
- Ellie.
- Wait, wait, wait, Ellie, Ellie, Ellie, Ellie, Ellie, Ellie, Elizabeth, Eleanor, Elton.
- Got nothing.
- Me neither.
- Casey.
- I can't get in. I don't have access.
- She's off the assignment.
- Look, I think Chuck's in trouble.
- He never goes anywhere without his phone.
- She's right.
- Now, Forrest, what I was going to say earlier--
- I disagree with your assessment.
- About what?
- Walker.
- She's a pro.
- Not only that, she's the best damn partner I ever had.
- I found this when I went to say good-bye to Chuck.
- Which directly disobeyed an order.
- You were fired for exactly this reason.
- Then there's nothing stopping me from kicking your ass.
- Chuck's in the courtyard.
- He's fine.
- We lost the surveillance signal from Ahmad's heart.
- Got to be a connection between the signal's disappearance and Chuck's.
- I don't understand.
- Isn't the GLG4000 specifically designed to track deep inside the Afghani caves? Yeah.
- You'd need at least six feet of solid steel to block that signal.
- This is the last location his heart registered before going off-grid.
- Overlay the satellite image.
- Wait a minute.
- They're in a bank vault. Yeah, that would do it. Great work, Walker.
- Okay, Dr. Woodcomb, time for you to remove the bug you placed inside my friend.
- And if you don't save him, nothing can save you.
- The patient is now fully under.
- Cool.
- Cool, good, good.
- Well done there.
- That's how we do things.
- I'm going to need to take a minute just so that I can center myself, if you will.
- I, uh, need a mellow headspace when I operate.
- Quit stalling, Dr. Woodcomb.
- I'm a little out of practice, honestly.
- Maybe if you could do it. Cut him open...
- or I'll cut you open.
- Oh, my God, oh, my God, I'm bleeding!
- Oh, my God, I'm bleeding. Come on.
- I'm sorry, I just get a little woozy at the sight of bl\*od.
- A surgeon who is afraid of bl\*od?
- I know-- a little ironic, right?
- Get the door, get the door!
- Get the door!
- Who the hell is Chuck? Huh? Chuck... Chuck?
- No clue... I have no clue.
- I'm Dr... I am Dr. Woodcomb, okay?
- Oh, yeah? Or Devon or Doc.
- Or sometimes people call me Captain Awesome, but I have no idea who this... who this Chuck...
- Oh, you mean that Chuck.
- You're a dead man, Chuck.
- Now Chuck is locked inside with one of Interpol's most wanted.
- It is your job to protect him, damn it.
- I've got nitroglycerin and a blasting cap in the van.
- I'll have this door off in no time.
- Hold on, I think I saw a nitrous setup in there.
- You're gonna blast the door open, are you're gonna k\*ll Chuck in the process.
- Come on, come on!
- What makes you think he's not already dead?
- Come here!
- What?
- What... what is it?
- I forgot why I was mad at you.
- I was gonna cut you with this.
- That's odd.
- I think I hear Chuck laughing.
- Here, give me the walkie.
- I'll handle it.
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.
- Think about it.
- Ladybugs can't all be ladies.
- I mean, that's just crazy.
- Then, how would we get little ladybugs?
- You know what I mean?
- Chuck, can you hear me?
- Hey, your pocket's talking.
- Oh, hey, can I get that?
- Yeah.
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi, yeah, I'm fine.
- I'm fine.
- I'm... I'm also high from nitrous, but so is... so is my man, Zamir, here, so...
- But I'm not coming out until you find Sarah and you bring her back here. That's right.
- Stand your ground.
- Like Hassan Khalid.
- Hey, where is that guy, anyway?
- 'Cause I haven't seen him around in a while.
- He's in the Eastern Karakoram caves.
- All right.
- Good for him.
- He's a bad dude, huh?
- Hey, Chuck, turn off the gas, idiot.
- You inhale too much of that stuff, it'll k\*ll you.
- We're going to die.
- You're gonna die!
- Open this door right now.
- No, look, I'm not listening to you, okay?
- This isn't working.
- I can't risk this going any further.
- I'm getting the nitro.
- Forrest, we can do this your way, or we can actually save the asset.
- Here. Sarah.
- Is it really you, or am I super stoned?
- Uh, both.
- Both Rashad Ahmad and Dr. Zamir are in custody.
- Though the mission didn't go according to plan, Chuck was able to ascertain the hidden location of t\*rror1st, Hassan Khalid.
- Thank you, Agent Forrest.
- Just doing my job, General.
- Agent Walker, despite your heroism, you have directly disobeyed several orders.
- Wait, General.
- I'm sorry, but-but... isn't the most important part of being my handler making sure that I stay alive? It's okay, Chuck.
- No, it's not.
- Let him finish.
- Thanks.
- Um... General... what I'm trying to say is that...
- I think that maybe because my relationship with Sarah is so...
- You know, we're... we're close.
- We care about each other.
- That's what I'm trying to say, and I know it's not protocol or whatever, but it's those feelings that wound up saving my life.
- Agent Forrest diagnosed your emotional connection as a liability.
- But I suppose it can also be an asset to the... well, asset.
- You may resume your post, Agent Walker.
- We hope not to see you too soon, Agent Forrest.
- That's all. no, this isn't... this isn't what you think.
- Yes, it is, Chuck.
- It's exactly what I think it is.
- I can't believe that you are covering for him.
- Nothing happened at the bachelor party.
- He didn't do anything, I swear it.
- Chuck, I saw the photos, okay?
- I'm sorry.
- I know you're just trying to protect him.
- Bro code, whatever, but, Chuck, Iam your sister.
- You're supposed to protect me.
- Sarah, please, I am freaking out, okay?
- I don't know who else to talk to, but I also don't want to get you in more trouble at work.
- It's okay-- this is my private residence.
- There is no surveillance that can talk to me.
- I don't know what to do.
- Ever since you guys rolled into town, my life has been... has been spinning out of control.
- My whole world is about juggling lies.
- It's like... it's like this.
- I bet this is a... what, a submachine g\*n?
- No, it dries my hair.
- Okay, fine, but everything else is completely screwed up.
- I just want to be able to tell Ellie the truth about who I am and what I do.
- I can't believe how much the United States Government has hurt the people that I love.
- Well, maybe it's time for the United States Government to help you.
- Chuck, you saved my life, man.
- Thanks for finding my key card.
- Dude?
