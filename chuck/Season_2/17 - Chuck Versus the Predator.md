# Chuck Versus the Predator

- Okay, I have to say this.
- We should never do that again.
- Mission's over, Chuck.
- Plan went just fine.
- Yeah, except that your plan necessitated that we do actual plumbing.
- And, for the record, none of us knows how to actually plumb.
- We're going to burn these jumpsuits, right?
- I second Chuck's motion.
- No more plumbing on future missions.
- What, are you going soft, Walker, huh?
- It doesn't matter.
- Beckman got the intel she wanted.
- Bunch of nancies. Ew.
- You need to change at Casey's?
- Huh? Oh, no, thanks.
- Actually, Ellie and Awesome are out of town looking for a wedding site.
- So I'm good to shower a couple hundred times.
- Okay.
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Sarah, have you heard anything from Beckman about Orion?
- Uh, not yet.
- These things take time.
- Gotcha. Okay.
- She gets how important it is, though, right?
- I mean, you know, if we could find Orion, then maybe I can get all these secrets out of my head, and go back to my old life.
- She gets it, Chuck.
- We all do.
- You want that, too, right?
- Of course I do, Chuck.
- Of course.
- I mean, you deserve that.
- Great.
- That's-That's great.
- I mean, I've only seen that little bit of Beckman's office behind her chair, but I can only imagine she's got a whole crack squad of brilliant analysts working hard trying to find Orion in the next room.
- Chuck, leave the search for Orion up to the team of brilliant analysts.
- You need to get some sleep.
- Why are you on?
- All clear.
- Alert FULCRUM-- Orion's gone.
- Ice.
- He was just here.
- Let's go.
- Get the computer.
- Incoming! Take cover!
- Down, down! Get down!
- Wh... ? When did this happen?
- During the night.
- Look on the bright side.
- We don't have to buy TP for, like, years.
- Why start now?
- Oh, no. They defiled our home here.
- This is our castle.
- Why would someone do this?
- Who could do this?
- Finally!
- Someone tried to clean up this store.
- Barclay.
- Assistant Manager Barclay. Beverly Hills Branch.
- Or, for you, "sir. "
- I should have brought my resume.
- Ouch.
- So, Bar-clay, you guys did this, huh?
- Clever trick, Bartowski.
- We admit nothing.
- Although, we are in Burbank.
- That should be a crime.
- I know, I know.
- Okay, Sir Barclay, hypothetically speaking, why would someone like yourself and your incredibly colorful and well-coordinated team do this to our store?
- I know why.
- Hello, Michael.
- Emmett.
- Barclay.
- You see, Barclay here is upset that we're getting the new Roark Instruments laptop before they do.
- We're getting the R7 gaming laptop first?
- No one has even seen it yet.
- Bet your britches.
- We're the flagship store.
- We should get those computers.
- Flagship of my ass.
- Now get out of here, Barclay.
- You think Morgan over there is tough?
- Wait till you see this guy.
- How was that, Michael?
- We got to work on that growl.
- Uh, sir, what are we going to do?
- I tell you what we could do.
- We could assemble a counterstrike.
- All right, all I need is a couple kegs of Silly String, and maybe...
- No retaliations.
- Calm and collected.
- That's the Buy More way.
- Now, clean this place up!
- Huh.
- You feeling okay, computer?
- Ah. Ha, ha, ha.
- Yeah, okay. Who's doing this?
- Your cleverness has been noted.
- Why are we meeting?
- You can hear me?
- What? Hello?
- Hello?
- Hey, Chuck!
- Hi. Hi. Hi, Sarah.
- What was it?
- Um...
- There's something that I should probably tell you.
- What? What did you say?
- I found him.
- I found Orion.
- Or, actually, he found me about ten minutes ago in the Buy More.
- He tapped into one of the Nerd Herd computers using, I might add, a very cool kind of hack.
- Chuck.
- How is that possible?
- I-I... It probably has something to do with my search.
- Your what?
- Chuck put together everything he knew about FULCRUM and Orion, and then he built an automated Web search.
- I think I hit one of his security nets.
- That's not how this works, Bartowski.
- You don't conduct your own operations.
- What did he say?
- Orion.
- Well, he knows I'm the Intersect.
- And he's going to send me a computer.
- Where's the computer going?
- To me.
- I-I think.
- I don't... We didn't really nail down the details.
- I want that computer under lock and key.
- Orion's computers are nextgen, capable of overriding military defenses, even hijacking computerized w*apon.
- God help us if it falls into the wrong hands.
- Delivery for Charles I. Bartowski.
- What is it?
- Says electronics. A computer?
- The Roark 7.
- Take that, Beverly Hills.
- I'm Chuck.
- You just leave it with me.
- Thanks.

- Nothing. Orion hasn't delivered the computer yet.
- Do you think he's going to bring it personally?
- No, he's going to stay away for now.
- Got it. Cool. So we wait.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Um...
- Chuck, your search for Orion was a rogue operation.
- Do you know how dangerous that is?
- Very.
- And I didn't tell you.
- And you didn't tell me.
- Okay, you're right.
- Completely and totally right.
- But, Sarah, I want to get this thing out of my head so I can go back to my old life and have a chance at a real relationship.
- Do you really think the NSA and the CIA are going to be cool with that?
- You should have trusted me.
- Dude, what am I doing here?
- Come on.
- It's in Jeff's office.
- Wait. No, no, no. Jeff's office?
- Don't worry. You got to see this.
- No, you don't understand. I don't want to go into Jeff's office. It makes me feel... uncomfortable.
- I know. Morgan, it's that good.
- Come on in.
- Oh, it's on.
- Long time no see, Morgan.
- Okay, I'm leaving.
- Wait.
- Look at this.
- What is it?
- It's like nothing I've ever seen before.
- Liquid cooled, titanium housing, over-clocked processor.
- Gentlemen, this is a work of art.
- It's the Roark 7.
- We're trying it out before we give it to Big Mike.
- You're here in case we get caught.
- Yeah, we figure Big Mike won't come down too hard on his boy.
- Thanks.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, close it, close it.
- Big Mike will know that we turned it on.
- No, just say you can't identify.
- Should I?
- Yeah.
- Uh, yeah, you better believe it.
- It's a simulator game.
- Who should we target?
- Buy More.
- Orion has taken control of a Predator drone based out of Edwards.
- Signal matches one he used in Hong Kong.
- Drone was on an armed targeting run.
- Is there a target? Please don't say Buy More.
- Orion sent you a computer all right.
- It's inside a Predator drone targeted to k*ll you.
- How thoughtful.
- Why would he... There's no time.
- We got to get everybody out of the store.
- Fire alarm. Okay, Chuck, you stay here and monitor the drone. boredom.
- Feels like we're flying an actual Predator.
- I give it three stars.
- Three stars? You're a cretin.
- The details are incredible. The graphics processor must be running on... Hold on a second.
- Why are we trying to blow up our own store here?
- Shouldn't we be targeting a certain Beverly Hills location?
- Guys, guys, wait.
- The drone is changing direction.
- Where's it heading?
- Telemetry puts it at the corner of Wilshire and Doheny.
- That's the Beverly Hills Buy More.
- Why would Orion target another store?
- He wouldn't.
- But I know who would.
- Look for Morgan.
- I'm on my way.
- Morgan, call me as soon as you get this. Don't think, just hit the callback button right now. No sign of Morgan, Jeff or Lester.
- Those morons have the computer, don't they?
- Which one dies first?
- Look, just go-go-go check the loading dock, and I'll look somewhere else. Go, now!
- Hold on a second, guys.
- It's Chuck again.
- Don't answer it; he's after my computer.
- Yeah, but he's called twice; he never does that.
- It could be an emergency.
- Why he'd call me, I have no idea.
- No! Morgan, no.
- Hey, Chuck.
- Hey, hey. Where are you?
- Uh, with Lester in Jeff's office.
- It's actually very nice.
- Morgan, you have to listen to me.
- You have to stop playing with that computer right now.
- Uh, why, Chuck?
- Buddy, just trust me and do it!
- Yeah, sure, Chuck.
- We are almost at Beverly Hills.
- Time to pull the plug, all right? Jig is up.
- Jeff stop him. Yes!
- Really?
- Chuck is our leader!
- No, he is your leader for some weird reason!
- Ah! You hurt me!
- Give it to me, Lester!
- No, no, no!
- Chuck, you stop!
- You stop right there!
- Ow!
- That really hurt.
- I want just one of them!
- No.
- Sarah, you're in the little boys' room.
- Oh.
- What the living heck is going on here?
- Is that it?
- Is that the Roark 7?
- No, uh, actually, this is...
- Yes it is, sir.
- We wanted to take a closer look at it. I figured it'd be okay.
- It's my fault. Crazy me.
- Nobody touches this computer until it goes on display tomorrow.
- We are being watched, people!
- We can't screw this up!
- Calm and collected.
- Calm and collected.
- Hmm.
- Such ne'er-do-wells we have here.
- Emmett, I want you to stand guard tonight.
- Nobody gets close to this laptop, got it?
- Affirmative, Michael.
- Barclay and the Beverly Hills boys will be g*n for it.
- I want that computer back, Jeffrey.
- It's calling me, and I must have it.
- An after-hours job.
- No problem.
- So I guess we know what our mission is: rob the Buy More.
- Tonight, after the store closes.
- At least nobody else knows it's here.
- Welcome, Vincent.
- It's good to see you survived the Hong Kong incident.
- We found Orion.
- Picked up a signal matching the computer he used in Hong Kong.
- It originated from a retail store in Burbank, California.
- Is it a Buy More store?
- Yes, it is.
- Would you like me to pick something up for you?
- FULCRUM has lost operatives there.
- We believe it's a CIA substation.
- The risk is too great for an operation.
- Sir, madam, you know me.
- I can't let this go.
- If I don't have your support, I'll do it myself.
- Then proceed, Vincent.
- We appreciate your initiative.
- It was a lawless town, Shane, Marshal Dillon, Clint Eastwood.
- Little girls in comparison to Milbarge.
- Rah!
- Oh, God.
- Okay, what's the plan?
- You got us into this mess, why don't you come up with the plan for once.
- Okay. All right.
- You two distract Emmett with your super spy k*ll while I go hit Big Mike's office.
- He keeps the combination of the safe in his desk.
- Keeps the combination in his office?
- It's a Buy More, Casey. Relax.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- There are no g*n in my plan.
- Okay? As annoying as Emmett is, you cannot sh**t, tranq, or karate chop him in any way.
- You put him in charge.
- All right.
- Let's go.
- Hello?
- Ooh, that better not be a rat.
- I'm hearing things.
- Just like Fresno.
- Just like Fresno.
- He's gonna find us. We're gonna get fired.
- I'll be turning tricks again by the end of the week.
- I can throw my voice.
- A diversion, good idea. Go, go, go.
- Caw-caw.
- Oh, my God, what was that?
- Did... did you throw your voice?
- I think.
- Seven hours to go.
- I almost got it, Casey.
- I'm in the office.
- Hey, way to go, Jeffrey.
- So throwing your voice really turned out great, didn't it?
- Huh? What other tricks do you know?
- When you saw a woman in half, do you actually saw her in half?
- Listen, I thought I lost you.
- I'm scared, man.
- I think I wet my pants.
- Just a little.
- Ha.
- Ha. What are the chances?
- Two burglars robbing the same place?
- What a funny coincidence.
- Hilarious.
- Give me the computer.
- We got to get out of here.
- Lester, come on.
- Let's go. Oh.
- I've tried to help you over the years, Jefferson.
- I've drowned myself trying to help you.
- But you're a moron.
- In the end, that's what you are.
- You're a Buy Moron.
- Do you get that?
- Do you?
- Lester.
- Hang on a sec, Jeff, I just got to...
- Hi.
- Who are you?
- Run! Run! Run!
- Run! Run! Run! Run!
- Die, intruders!
- Die!
- Mother! Mother!
- Mother? ! Mother? !
- That's right.
- Nobody messes with this Buy More.
- Nobody.
- You want to mess with me and my store?
- Well, bring it on, bitches!
- That felt good.
- Casey!
- Huh?
- I had to that.
- Guys.
- You get one chance.
- Drop your g*n.
- Um, sir, they don't have any g*n.
- I personally put this mission together, and I forbade them from packing.
- Why would you do that?
- I don't know.
- I just, you know--
- I think that g*n make things too easy, and I like my spies to be tough.
- Look, you're not gonna sh**t anyone, right?
- It would be unprofessional not to.
- You had a g*n? !
- I always have a g*n.
- Don't you dare move.
- Guys...
- I-I really didn't need to see that.
- Oh, sweet Bolonia.
- Who's your Big Mike? Who's your Big Mike?
- I'm busy, Emmett. What? !
- Okay, be right there.
- Morgan! Wake up!
- We got trouble at the store!
- Beverly Hills made their move!
- Oh, thank God.
- I contacted Langley.
- They'll send a team to dispose of the body tomorrow.
- Guys, I don't understand.
- That was supposed to be the easiest mission ever.
- How did a FULCRUM agent show up?
- How did he know the computer was there?
- Who else knows about it?
- All right, well, we got plenty of scary questions, now let's get some answers.
- Don't touch that computer.
- Why?
- You weren't contacted by Orion.
- Uh, what?
- Wait, wait. He knew that I was the Intersect.
- Who else could possibly know that?
- FULCRUM.
- My analysts believe you walked into a FULCRUM trap.
- Are you certain?
- I didn't think...
- No, you didn't think. None of you did.
- And you put this entire operation in jeopardy.
- But, General, if it's Orion, this laptop is the only way for us to contact him.
- Major. If I could just...
- We can't take that risk.
- My NSA technicians will inspect the computer.
- Sarah, please.
- I'm-I'm sorry, Chuck.
- Orders.
- General, we don't have time to send this computer off to Washington and wait.
- If this really is Orion, he may not contact us again.
- You're right, we don't have time.
- That's why I'm taking over this operation directly.
- I'll be on site within the hour.
- What? You're coming here?
- Hopefully I won't have to shut down Operation Bartowski because of one foolish mistake, but if FULCRUM knows who you really are, pack your bags, Chuck.
- You're leaving with me.
- Tell your family and friends...
- Tell them nothing.
- General, I implore you.
- Don't use "implore. "
- Only use words that you actually use.
- Here's why I think that Orion is legit.
- I don't say "legit. "
- Chuck.
- Is Beckman here?
- Uh, she's on her way.
- Okay. What about the computer?
- It's inside Castle.
- Beckman has a containment unit en route to move it out.
- Guys, look, I am certain that Orion is not FULCRUM, okay?
- This is the real guy.
- If I could just get five to 45 minutes with her, I could convince the General.
- No, she doesn't want to see you.
- Please just wait in your room.
- Secure the perimeter.
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you about my search, but...
- It's okay. I'll explain it to her.
- Now, go.
- All clear.
- Is the asset secure?
- Yes, ma'am.
- It was a highly professional team, Michael.
- There must have been 30...
- 40 of them.
- They stormed the store.
- And they took the new laptop.
- What do you think? Barclay?
- Whoever did this broke some serious laws here, boss.
- It's Barclay, all right.
- I can smell him all over this.
- Hey! We came as soon as we heard.
- Heard what? Nobody called you.
- Mm-hmm. Correct.
- Bingo. Yeah, no, they closed the tap at Benny's, saw the commotion, wanted to see what was going on.
- I'm calling the police.
- Put that phone down. Oh, God.
- We can't let them get away with this.
- Okay, we can't be calm and collected this time.
- Let me see it.
- Mm-hmm.
- No, Morgan.
- We will remain calm and collected.
- We will be calm and collected when we go to Beverly Hills tonight and we will be calm and collected when I use my manager's code to get into the store.
- And then we will be calm and collected when we burn that mother loving store to the ground.
- Sir, what exactly are we doing here?
- Payback.
- I see.
- Does payback involve illegal activities?
- Damn well better.
- Hello, this is Chuck speaking.
- Hello, Chuck.
- Where's my computer?
- Orion... Orion?
- Um... uh, unfortunately, your computer is currently locked up in a top secret government facility.
- You have to get it.
- I can't.
- My handlers think that you're FULCRUM, and to be perfectly honest, I'm on the fence myself.
- I'm not FULCRUM.
- Thanks.
- Thanks, I'm glad we cleared that up, but how can I be certain?
- Look at your computer.
- How did you know that was in the Intersect?
- I put it there.
- A long time ago.
- You really are Orion.
- Wake up, Casey.
- The '80s are over.
- I lied to Chuck earlier.
- He's done what no one else could do.
- He found him.
- Chuck found Orion.
- General, why lie to him?
- Orion is extremely important to this project and to Chuck.
- Important?
- Don't think for a second that you can tell me what is important, Agent Walker.
- I've had an army of analysts and spies hunting for Orion since before you were in a training bra.
- After the first Cipher was completed, Orion purged his personal records and disappeared.
- We've been looking for him ever since.
- So has FULCRUM.
- Neither of us has been able to lay a hand on him.
- Until now.
- Until Bartowski.
- You need to go.
- No, look, I have to tell Sarah and Casey what you just did.
- It's proof that you're Orion.
- And, on another note, I've got a small convention of agents gathered in my courtyard, and my team is in a high-level meeting.
- You can't trust them.
- Who, Sarah and Casey?
- They save my life on a regular basis.
- Go to your computer.
- So, we're dealing with the real Orion.
- How dangerous is he?
- When FULCRUM made a move on him in Hong Kong, he nearly destroyed an entire building with a stolen Predator.
- Wow.
- Beckman is tiny.
- General, what if Orion can help Chuck remove the Intersect, erase it from his mind?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Good question, Sarah.
- That's exactly what I don't want.
- Chuck Bartowski is absolutely vital to national security.
- He can never meet Orion.
- Do you understand that, Agent Walker?
- Uh... yes.
- What?
- Sarah, no.
- Yes, I understand.
- You have 40 seconds to exit.
- Their surveillance is down.
- What about the agents?
- Leave the watch.
- Go now.
- What's happening?
- Uh... that's good.
- Who did you think I was?
- I'm sorry, I had to make certain this wasn't a trap.
- Orion.
- Hello, Chuck.
- It's good to finally see you face-to-face.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, same here.
- Can I... can I ask you a question?
- Of course.
- The Intersect that's in my head right now...
- You want to get it out, don't you?
- Yes, yes, I very much do.
- We need to meet first.
- Okay, yeah, yeah.
- My calendar is pretty wide open.
- When can we meet tonight?
- Tonight?
- I'm in Los Angeles.
- We have much to discuss-- meet me here in an hour.
- Orion out.
- Okay.
- Chuck out.
- Don't scream.
- I have a splitting headache.
- Oh, oh, oh.
- You're... you're not dead.
- A modified poison extracted from blowfish.
- FULCRUM agents are taught to survive its near-death state.
- That sounds like a fun class.
- Not really.
- Now...
- I need you to do exactly as I say.
- Stand up.
- Stand up... I'm standing.
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Sorry, sorry.
- Let's go.
- I don't care what Bartowski thinks he wants.
- I want Orion.
- General.
- What is it, Walker?
- I need to say something.
- Chuck Bartowski has risked his life for this country.
- But he's not a spy, and he knows it.
- He's a spy until I say he isn't.
- General, Chuck knows that Orion is out there, and he is not going to just sit in his room and do what we say.
- He...
- What is it? Where is Chuck?
- The watch has him in his room.
- No, this is Chuck we're talking about.
- He would have come up with some excuse to come in here and meet the general in person.
- What?
- Check his room.
- Walker's right.
- Chuck's a social butterfly by nature.
- Checking the Castle.
- No, wait, wait, wait, run the tape back.
- There's got to be something else.
- Okay.
- I shut off the security cameras.
- We're clear.
- My God.
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, it's so clean and fresh, like...
- Douches. Oh, my God.
- Oh, hey.
- You know what we'll do?
- We'll draw little funny faces on them.
- How about that?
- Nope.
- What's that?
- My fiddle.
- We're going to play music?
- Oh, yeah.
- No, no, hold on a second.
- Wait, wait, wait... uh, stand by here, everybody.
- Can I have a moment of your time?
- If we could just, uh, talk about what's about to happen here, okay, and see what emotions start bubbling up, and... talk.
- You and I will talk.
- We'll just talk it out.
- This isn't you, sir.
- They hit one of my men.
- Then, let Emmett have the bat, all right?
- Let him take his revenge out on the store.
- That... that sounds vaguely sane.
- Here.
- I can be destructive.
- Oh.
- All right! So...
- What to hit first?
- Ah!
- How about that?
- All right, one more time.
- With feeling.
- Oh, God.
- Okay, team...
- We should run now.
- Viva la Buy More!
- Burbank style!
- How long have you known Orion?
- I don't really know him.
- You're CIA, right?
- Sure.
- Name's Carmichael.
- I've heard of you.
- Orion was coming out of the cold for you.
- That's excellent work.
- I've been after him for three years.
- What's your secret?
- Someone's approaching from the east.
- I need you to stand by the window so Orion can see you.
- Tell him it's safe.
- Tell him it's safe.
- Yeah, it's safe.
- Take him!
- Take him to the roof. Chopper's on the way.
- On behalf of FULCRUM, I'd like to thank you, Agent Carmichael.
- I wish I could give you a proper reward.
- But, fortunately, I have to sh**t you.
- It would be unprofessional not to.
- Chopper is here.
- Move out now. Now!
- No, no, they have Orion!
- They're gonna take him to the roof!
- No, we're not...
- I can save him!
- Chuck!
- No!
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.
- Yes, General, I read you.
- We have to get outta here.
- A Predator's heading toward us.
- He's trying to take himself out.
- Chuck, we have to go now.
- No, no, I can do this.
- I can reprogram the Predator.
- Come on!
- We are leaving, Chuck.
- No! No, no, no, I have to do this.
- He can't die!
- Chuck, you can't save him.
- Okay, you can't fix this one.
- It's better that Orion didn't fall into FULCRUM's hands.
- He knew what they would do to him.
- He knew what they would gain.
- General, you don't want the Intersect out of my head, do you?
- No, I don't.
- Ma'am, Chuck has done everything that we've asked of him.
- Agent Walker, you want to protect him.
- But playtime is over.
- Chuck, I hesitate to say this.
- Please, please, hesitate.
- We are in the midst of a secret w*r with FULCRUM.
- And I believe the outcome of this fight will rest squarely on your shoulders.
- Oy.
- No, listen to the man.
- He's right.
- I'm no spy.
- Do you know how many agents I've lost to FULCRUM?
- How powerful they are?
- Only this operation, only you have found a hole in their armor.
- See, I can't lose you, Chuck.
- I need you.
- It's time for you to become a spy.
- Yes!
- Yes!
- Love the smell of Burbank in the morning!
- Smells like victory!
- Hey!
- We know what you did.
- Well, do you now?
- You went too far, Michael.
- I'm calling the cops.
- No, you won't.
- It ain't the Buy More way.
- What?
- You know the rules.
- They cut their prices by 10%, we cut ours 15.
- They give away toasters, we give away microwaves.
- They put their hands on one of ours, we find their assistant manager and...
- You get the picture, don't you?
- We're leaving.
- But speaking for my store and the city of Beverly Hills as a whole, we do not approve of your methods.
- Well, you're not from Burbank.
- Hah!
- Thanks for stopping me back there.
- The store doesn't need any more trouble than it's already got.
- What is it, sir?
- Rumors mostly.
- There's been some talk about a store in the area closing.
- People being fired-- Times are tough.
- Sure, yeah.
- We can't let that happen.
- Don't worry, son.
- We won't.
- If you're watching this, Chuck, it means something happened to me.
- Probably something not so nice.
- Well, I hope we were able to meet, I hope I was able to tell you my real name.
- The cards you're looking at are the schematics for the new Intersect.
- I stole them from FULCRUM.
- Show them to no one, but study them.
- You will need to understand that computer if you want to get the Intersect out of your head.
- And yes, it's possible.
- If you can find FULCRUM's Intersect, if you can get inside, you could get your old life back.
- Good-bye, Chuck.
- This disk will self destruct in five seconds.
- Always wanted to say that.
- Chuck? Hi.
- She's wrong, you know.
- I'm not a spy.
- Look, Beckman is a soldier and she see things in black and white.
- But she is right about one thing.
- We're in the middle of a fight with FULCRUM.
- Yeah, uh...
- I get that, I do.
- But this is not my future.
- This is what I'm doing right now.
- But I will get my life back.
- Yeah, of course you will, Chuck.
- We're still a good team, right?
- You still trust us?
- I trust you.
- Of course I do.
- I'm on your side, Chuck.
- I know.
- Well, I-I better go.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm a little b*at.
- Okay.
- Is Walker on board with this mission, Major Casey?
- Yes, ma'am, 100%.
- You have no reservations about how she feels toward the asset?
- No, ma'am.
- I want everything you have on her and Bartowski.
- Video surveillance and your unedited report.
- Don't you trust me?
- I don't trust anybody.
