# Chuck Versus the Best Friend

- Congratulations. You've been selected for an elite operations unit.
- With your permission, we'd like to conduct a test to determine your suitability for service.
- Sure. You mind me asking what you're testing me for?
- Just relax.
- We have a short training video that will explain everything.
- Wait.
- Are you okay, Chuck?
- Oh, um... no, no.
- Not since Emmett started playing romantic comedies 24/7.
- He must love Must Love Dogs,
- 'cause that's always playing.
- Right.
- Well, I was just wondering about tonight.
- Oh, is there a mission tonight?
- Actually, I was referring to the whole Valentine's Day thing.
- Oh, my gosh, right.
- I'm so sorry... did you want to do something?
- No, no, I was just curious.
- Unless you wanted to do something?
- Doesn't it seem like we ought to do something?
- I mean, it's up to you. Yeah, sure.
- Okay, I mean, we have been cover dating for over a year now, right?
- Yeah, I mean, it would be weird if we didn't do something.
- Completely weird.
- Maybe we could give our covers the night off.
- I have a bunch of paperwork to catch up on anyway.
- Good. Great.
- Hey, hey, hey, happy Valentine's Day, you two.
- Any hot plans for today?
- Absolutely, there is.
- My house at 8:00, right?
- I can hardly wait.
- I'll see you then, sweetie.
- Oh, okay.
- Bye.
- Did you ever think that the two of us would wind up with smart, beautiful, sexually adventuresome girls on Valentine's Day?
- The answer is no.
- Two jackasses like you landing two hot pieces like Anna and Blondie?
- It's a cruel trick of nature.
- Grimes! Get your butt to the sales floor before I kick it over there.
- Bartowski, herd up your nerds.
- They're right... they're right there.
- And you two dimwits, don't leave the cage until that backlog of repairs are finished.
- And where is Milbarge?
- Hello.
- I'm sorry I'm late... I was just waiting for these to cool.
- What the hell is that?
- Oh, well, I put little lips on the cupcakes for you.
- I'm talking about that thing on your head.
- Well, Henrietta's in town.
- I wanted to look my best.
- I mean, it's not that much of a difference.
- Really?
- I'll be in my office.
- Next time, do your baking on your own time.
- My God, who crapped in his box of chocolates?
- I don't care what it costs!
- Get it here tomorrow!
- What's he doing in there?
- I don't know, but it's completely unnatural.
- Oh, my God.
- You don't think that he's...
- Working? Calm down, Morgan.
- Yeah, there's got to be a rational explanation for this.
- Oh, no, look at him.
- The guy's a machine.
- I think Morgan's on to something.
- What if it's not really Big Mike?
- What?
- Like, a robot sent from the future?
- A cybernetic organism.
- A skin job.
- There's only one way to find out.
- If he bleeds, he's human.
- Guys.
- How about I just talk to him?
- Please.
- Okay, fine.
- It's your funeral, Bartowski.
- Let me ask a question, Bartowski.
- What kind of woman delivers divorce papers on Valentine's Day?
- Your... your wife?
- The lady Big Mike is no more.
- I'm-I'm so sorry to hear that, sir.
- Damn straight.
- I had the catch of a lifetime and let her get away.
- You want to talk about it?
- I'll be fine.
- Long as I keep working, I won't have time to realize I'm gonna spend the rest of my life alone and unloved.
- There is one thing you can do for me.
- Sure.
- Tell those imbeciles out there to get cracking!
- 'Cause from now on, it's a whole new Buy More!
- Get that damn Must Love Dogs off the TV.
- Can I ask you a question? Sure.
- This is the worst Valentine's Day ever, right?
- Come on, don't be silly.
- Please, you're not going to offend me.
- There's got to be someone somewhere having a far worse Valentine's Day.
- On the night of August 12, 1965, the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines endeavored to make a daring helicopter as*ault on the Elephant Valley.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- What can I do for you, General?
- LAPD just picked up one of ours.
- The agent's name is Jim Yeager.
- He's been missing for over a year, although he was presumed to be on a covert domestic assignment.
- Unfortunately, we have no record of this assignment, and so far, the subject has been... uncooperative.
- Cat's got his tongue, huh?
- You want me to take a crack at him?
- As you can see, his mental state is fragile enough already.
- The subject's last confirmed location comes from a phone call traced to this LA cul-de-sac.
- Yeager was living in the Valley?
- Huh... no wonder he went nuts, right?
- We took the liberty of purchasing a home there to serve as a base of operations.
- Zoom in on that, please.
- What's that he keeps saying?
- Salamander.
- Possible code name for his enemy contact.
- Our best guess: he chose this location for its proximity to a sleeper cell.
- I need for someone to resume Yeager's assignment, identify his contact and infiltrate their t*rror1st network.
- I don't know how well I'd fit in with those people, General.
- Not you, Major Casey.
- We need a normal couple.
- That Casey?
- Looks like we got a mission.
- Thank God.
- I'm afraid you two are gonna have to drop your dating cover for this particular assignment.
- No problem. What is it?
- Thai street racing gang, a Ukrainian prostitution ring?
- No, for this mission, you and Agent Walker are gonna be married.
- You two kids are going to the suburbs.
- Good luck as a normal couple.
- No.
- Maybe.
- Breaking out a dad shirt, huh?
- Yeah.
- What do you think?
- Well, I think it makes you look very grown-up.
- Oh, good, that's kind of the idea.
- Yeah, where are you guys going?
- Uh, Sarah and I are just house-sitting.
- Her boss at the Orange Orange is out of town, so...
- Oh, Chuck, that's... that's great.
- Spending a week in the suburbs?
- Yeah, dream come true.
- No, don't you get it?
- This is... this is like a dry run, you know, so you and Sarah can see what it would really be like.
- Zip it!
- That is your wedding craziness right there, so keep that... that's yours.
- We're just house-sitting... it's no big deal.
- Okay, fine, can we call it cohabitating with your long-term girlfriend in a house that doesn't have posters that were hung in the eighth grade?
- That-That... is a collectible, but yeah, fine.
- We can... we can call it that.
- Then, that is a big step forward.
- Love what you've done with the place.
- Thanks... I had help.
- Uh, sorry, but whose life have I stepped into?
- What-What...
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?
- I'm making potato salad.
- Are you cooking for the entire neighborhood?
- No, Chuck.
- You are.
- Hey, there's the grill-meister!
- Welcome, neighbors.
- Don't forget, one of our new neighbors is a suspected t*rror1st.
- You heard the little lady.
- Get out there and mingle.
- Gentlemen,
- I think that I speak for all of us when I say that the only reason that I took this job at the Buy More was to do as little work as humanly possible.
- And the big man... he made that dream a reality.
- That man's an inspiration to slackers everywhere.
- Until his old lady dumped him.
- We're screwed... I mean, we're screwed now that he has nothing to live for except for work.
- Yeah, but how do we get Mrs. Big Mike to take him back?
- How do you mend a broken heart?
- You mean, how do we get him laid?
- I'm sorry to interrupt this little meeting of the minds, but you're not the only ones who find this new regime insufferable.
- It's obvious that our rotund leader is channeling his sexual energies into the Buy More.
- In my opinion, our only hope...
- Is to channel them back into sex. Yes, brilliant, Emmett, but where do we find Big Mike a ridiculously out of his league hottie?
- Yeah, someone who will suck his... will to work out of him.
- Not at a Bennigans's bar.
- Sometimes, that fruit hangs a little too low.
- Where do you meet people you don't have to pay for sex?
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Oh...
- Hi. How you doing?
- I'm good. I'm... I... Hi. My name is Charles.
- Oh, I'm Brad.
- I live next door. There you go.
- I'm... I'm so sorry.
- I just ran out.
- Well, lucky for you, I'm in the stationery biz.
- Check this baby out.
- It is 110 pound card stock, brand-new, genuine embossing, antique finish.
- Listen, don't let any of these bums know, but I can get you a thousand of those at cost.
- Enough shoptalk.
- Let's go meet some of the natives. What do you say?
- Okay.
- Guys, this is Charlie.
- Uh, Charlie, over here we got Mark.
- Hi. Hi. Whatever you do, do not let him drive your golf cart.
- We got Dennis here. Uh, Dennis and his wife, Trudy, every Friday night, they play a pretty wild game of charades.
- It gets pretty zany.
- And this one, last but least, Mitch.
- Do not believe a word this dog says.
- Hold on a minute.
- Who is that talking to my wife?
- Oh, that's-that's my wife.
- That's Sarah.
- Well...
- Well done, Charlie.
- You want to trade sometime?
- I'm kidding!
- No way the PTA would stand for that.
- All right, all right.
- Just a few more details and you will be ready to mingle with the singles.
- Who the hell is this Lando Calrissian?
- He's only the coolest guy in the entire universe.
- It's just your user name.
- Six-two, 185 pounds?
- I don't know, Morgan. Listen to me.
- Everybody is taller and thinner online.
- It's called the Internet hotness conversion factor.
- What do you want your job to be?
- Uh, manager at the Buy More.
- Make him an astronaut.
- What about lion tamer? Wait, I got it. I got it.
- I just don't know about this whole World Wide Web business.
- That ain't no way to meet a woman.
- You know how I met my wife?
- Church picnic.
- Yeah, look how that worked out.
- There was no hiding who you were or-or how you felt.
- The very first time I laid my eyes on Gladys, I knew.
- Good Lord.
- Who are they?
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Users who matched your profile.
- This ain't no church picnic.
- Check out Red Hot Mama.
- Muy caliente.
- What about the Internet hotness conversion factor?
- Doesn't that work both ways?
- Why can't you see her face in that picture?
- Focus on the body, Michael.
- Gee whiz, Mike.
- We're trying to help you find love here.
- Dirty, nasty, filthy love.
- So, then the Greek guy says, "Well, at least we know where the olive went. "
- My sentiments exactly.
- Can I let you in on little a secret about your neighbors, Mr... ?
- Carmichael. Charles.
- They bore me.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, it's, uh... it's not really my scene either.
- Perhaps the two of us can, uh, get together sometime.
- Maybe engage in something a little more... stimulating?
- Don't-Don't...
- Sorry. I... Slippery.
- That's very kind of you to offer and it sounds like a lot of fun, but I am very, very married.
- Congratulations, Mr. Carmichael.
- But who isn't?
- My husband's right over there.
- He's a big fella, isn't he?
- What line of work is he in?
- Lumberjack?
- The kind that keeps him out of town.
- Charles!
- Is that your wife?
- She seems very... pretty.
- Well, got to run. You know how it is.
- The old ball and chain.
- Listen, Charles.
- I just live right across the street.
- So call me... when the honeymoon's over.
- I've got a chain, too.
- I bet you do.
- Excuse me.
- Well?
- No flashes. No nothing.
- I think our neighbors are clean.
- Except for that lady across the street.
- She's got a dirty mouth.
- Well, are you sure you checked everybody?
- Maybe we got the wrong cul-de-sac.
- Mr. and Mrs. Carmichael?
- Would you come inside, please?
- There's a slight problem with your cable.
- Looks like one of ours.
- Uh, correction... that was one of ours.
- That bug was stolen from a CIA substation in Omaha in '06.
- Now it belongs to FULCRUM.
- And here I thought we were all looking for a garden-variety t*rror1st.
- Better hurry up, buddy.
- Your wieners are burning.
- I knew these people creeped me out.
- Hi. Did you sleep well?
- Like a log, honey.
- How did you sleep?
- What are you doing? Did Casey find more bugs?
- I'm cooking breakfast.
- Casey swept the house. It's clean.
- Okay. Well, are we going to invite the neighbors over?
- No, Chuck. I-I'm cooking for you.
- What?
- Nothing.
- It's just funny.
- I never pictured you doing this.
- Well, what can I say?
- I'm versatile.
- Sit.
- Hold on.
- Are-Are-Are you enjoying this whole Martha Stewart thing?
- I can't believe it.
- Please tell me you're not going soft on me.
- Just shut up and eat your breakfast.
- You better be careful, Sarah.
- One day you might actually turn into a real girl.
- Sweetie.
- Sweetie?
- I almost forgot.
- Would you mind swinging by the store for me?
- Have a great day at work.
- Okay.
- Wipe that look off your face.
- Wait, that's Sarah's...
- Invisible ink, really? You guys can't just use the phone? We're dealing with FULCRUM here.
- They bugged your house, they bugged the phones.
- Sometimes you got to do it the old-fashioned way.
- "Location clear. Target on move"?
- Wait. You guys figured out who planted the bug?
- Yeah.
- Ring any Intersect bells?
- Yeah, that's crazy cougar lady's husband.
- How do you know it's him?
- Well, while you and Walker were busy playing house, I was doing some old-fashioned spy work.
- Pulled a fingerprint off the bug, ran it through the database.
- So, who was this guy before FULCRUM?
- CIA Psy-Ops.
- Agency shrinks. A real bunch of weirdos.
- I also ran his bank records.
- Turns out he bought enough of this stuff to stretch from here to Gardena.
- Infiniband data line. The same stuff we use to tap into the Agency's intranet.
- Any idea what your neighbor was using it for?
- I don't know.
- Uh, online gaming?
- p*rn?
- Or... I don't know. Or...
- Hacking into government servers.
- Or hacking into government servers.
- I was going to say that eventually.
- Okay, great. I'm glad you guys cracked it.
- Glad I could help.
- Help... by getting us into that house and onto that computer.
- You want me to go in as Nerd Herd?
- Wrong again, Bartowski.
- You're going to go in the old-fashioned way.
- You want me to sleep with our neighbor Sylvia?
- No, we want you to pretend to want to sleep with her, and then see if you can get on her FULCRUM husband's PC and see if you flash on anything.
- You want to throw in a little sex... that's your prerogative.
- Whatever, Casey. Look, I just don't know how Sarah's going to feel about this.
- There's no way she's going to let her husband just sleep with...
- Is he ready?
- Chuck, look, I'm sorry, but this is our best option.
- Target's got the house rigged with state-of-the-art security.
- And since his wife's expressed a romantic interest in you...
- We need you to exploit it.
- Oh, exploit it. Gotcha.
- Yeah. Textbook CIA.
- Look, Casey and I will be with you every step of the way.
- Yeah, if the cougar gets a little hairy, you can always tap out.
- Look, we understand if this makes you uncomfortable.
- Breaking my fake wedding vows?
- No, forget about it.
- I'm golden. Just hit me with another spritz of that, would you?
- Why here?
- Mr. Carmichael.
- I didn't expect you to come so quickly.
- Charles Carmichael always comes quickly.
- Real smooth, Bartowski.
- Come on in. Okay.
- The cable enters the house through the northwest corner, upstairs.
- Oh, hey!
- This is where the magic happens.
- What do you think your, uh, wife would say if she knew you were up here?
- You think she'd be jealous?
- Well, it's like you said.
- I mean, the honeymoon... she is over.
- Hi-oh. If you don't mind me asking, when was the last time you and your wife made love?
- Well, that's a... that's a... that's a...
- That's a good one.
- You know, things have been a little cold in that department lately. Oh, poor baby.
- Do you know what I'm going to do to you, Charles?
- I got a pretty good idea.
- I'm going to thaw you out.
- Oh, I bet you are, you-you she-devil.
- You temptress, you've taken my sock off.
- Ticklish. Ticklish. Ticklish.
- Those are my feet. That's my feet area.
- Maybe-Maybe you know what?
- Maybe we could just talk for a few minutes.
- How's that sound? Ugh.
- You didn't come here to talk.
- I didn't? I didn't come here to talk?
- Why, why not? Talking's perfectly...
- Talking's overrated anyway, isn't it?
- No, you know what?
- It's just that I'm a little...
- I'm a little nervous because this is... the whole adultery game is a little new... little new to me.
- And I think, I think just a... just a drink, a little liquid courage would really go a long way right now.
- Is Scotch okay?
- Sounds delish.
- Thank you.
- I'll be right here.
- But you already knew that.
- Crazy person.
- Come...
- Casey, I'm handcuffed.
- Relax. Handcuffs are a cinch.
- Really? Yeah.
- There's a bone in your thumb. Tiny bone.
- Real easy to break.
- What you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to apply torsional pressure to it until it snaps.
- I'm not gonna break my bone!
- Well, in that case, you are screwed.
- Think. Think. Think.
- Wait a minute. Wait.
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.
- Oh, okay.
- Damn it. Password protected.
- Salamander.
- Chuck.
- Chuck, you have to get out of there.
- Chuck? Chuck?
- Stay where you are, Agent Walker. I'm going in after him.
- Have you tested him yet?
- He's upstairs. I've got him cuffed.
- He was just here.
- He ran the test.
- He survived.
- We found our subject.
- Good afternoon.
- Charlie?
- Brad.
- You are never gonna believe what just happened to me over there!
- Well, this ought to be good.
- I send you there undercover and you not only nearly expose Mr. Bartowski to FULCRUM but to an entire cul-de-sac of civilians?
- No excuses, General, we pooched it.
- No.
- No, we didn't pooch it.
- We didn't pooch it. General, look, I-I saw something on that computer, okay?
- I saw... pictures.
- How illuminating. General, they weren't regular pictures.
- They were like Intersect pictures, embedded files, like the ones that Bryce sent me, only... very different.
- We think Chuck could have FULCRUM programming in his brain.
- In that case, I'm pulling Mr. Bartowski from this operation.
- But as long as Agent Walker's cover is intact, I want you two to lock down the cul-de-sac, monitor FULCRUM, see what else you can uncover before we make a move on their cell.
- The Carmichaels are getting a divorce.
- Oh, my, my, my.
- Don't you look prosperous, Michael.
- Wow, tonight's the night with the Internet lady?
- How ya feeling, big guy?
- Like an imposter.
- Look at me.
- Look at this ridiculous outfit.
- She's gonna take one look at me and realize I am not a 185-pound shipping magnate.
- Oh, relax. That suit is... very slimming. That's right.
- That's right. You know what?
- It'll make your wallet look fat.
- Yeah, Morgan's right.
- That poor lady is not gonna know what hit her.
- You're gonna need a hydraulic crowbar to pry her off.
- Yes.
- What do you say, Bartowski?
- Should I come clean?
- Tell her who I really am?
- You got your girl without having to lie about your lowly occupation, right?
- Um... yeah, you know, I'm-I'm not so sure I'm the best role model.
- You're better than these losers.
- When was the last time any of y'all had dates?
- And I'm not counting Bennigan's.
- And you... you and Anna break up every other week.
- And you...
- I don't even know what your affiliation is, Elvis.
- What does he mean, my affiliation?
- That bathroom thing.
- Look, Mike, I don't know.
- It's up to you.
- But do you really want to be a part of a relationship that's founded on lies?
- The answer's yes.
- Yep. Absolutely. He is not thinking.
- Oh, my...
- Agent Walker, I've got unknowns moving on your position.
- This is Sarah. Leave a message.
- Sarah, Sarah, you and Casey have to get out of the cul-de-sac immediately... I just flashed, I just flashed on something.
- I think it was FULCRUM... it was something that I...
- I uploaded off the computer, okay.
- Excuse me. Hi. Yeah, could you give me a hand with my cable, please?
- The company that built the neighborhood is a front.
- Uh, if you're looking for free premium channels I'm not the guy.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- It's nothing like that.
- It's not just a house.
- The entire neighborhood is FULCRUM.
- For some reason I'm getting some kind of weird interference.
- I think somebody in the neighborhood might be running some kind of high-powered electronic equipment.
- Actually, I think it... it might be that house right over there.
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry about what happened with your husband.
- It must have been awful.
- It's times like these you need your neighbors most.
- Oh. Thank you.
- Uh, come in.
- I hope you like brownies.
- Looking for the wife?
- She's having a chat with the ladies.
- You feeling all right, buddy?
- How's this bl*od pressure?
- A little heigh.
- Should I give him more sedative?
- No. CHUCK: Sarah?
- He's going to be fine. Sarah?
- Where's Sarah?
- Sarah?
- Where's Sarah?
- Where's my wife? Mr. Carmichael, she isn't your wife.
- She's a CIA agent.
- And so are you.
- Wha...
- What do you want with me?
- You have got a very special brain.
- Don't worry.
- We're going to do everything we can to not damage it.
- Damage? Damage?
- What is he talking about?
- What you saw upstairs was a small part of a computer program.
- The CIA designed it to implant intelligence directly into agents through encoded images.
- But the CIA gave up on the program.
- They decided to slug it out, fighting the w*r on terror using Cold w*r tactics.
- But we're training agents who are ready to fight tomorrow's wars.
- How would you like to be a part of that future?
- How would you like to be part of FULCRUM?
- What about...
- What about her?
- Look, I'll do whatever you want, just let her go.
- Don't tell me you have feelings for your partner? Boy, you really let her get into your head, huh?
- What did she tell you?
- That someday you two would be together?
- Maybe settle down in a cute little cul-de-sac like this one?
- You're funny.
- This place isn't real.
- Her feelings for you aren't real.
- Don't worry.
- This next part should help you get over her.
- If he survives it.
- Chuck!
- He can't hear you.
- No, no, no!
- Chuck... Chuck...
- Oh, he's toast. SARAH: Chuck.
- Get him out of here.
- Dump him where you dumped the others.
- What just happened?
- Mr. Carmichael.
- Do you know where you are, Mr. Carmichael?
- Beneath Meadow Branch subdivision in a FULCRUM lab that was built as part of a secret initiative.
- What initiative?
- To rebuild the Intersect computer.
- Oh, my God, it worked.
- Can I ask just one more question?
- You mind if we, uh, test your wife next?
- Wife?
- I don't have a wife.
- Before you run the test, I'd like to tell Agent Walker something.
- Agent Walker.
- Now we have a name.
- Close your eyes.
- No, no, no!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. You?
- I think so.
- Take these guys to the detention center.
- That one goes to the agency morgue.
- We're not done with him yet.
- Besides testing on humans, it appears that FULCRUM is perilously close to completing their own Intersect computer, making Bartowski more important than ever.
- His life has never been in more danger.
- The honeymoon is over, Agent Walker.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, everything okay?
- Yeah, just a routine debriefing.
- Uh, so I was wondering if you wanted to swing by the old cul-de-sac tonight.
- Why?
- Uh, I don't know, I mean, I... you know, I figured we've still got the place, and Ellie still thinks we're house-sitting, so I thought that, you know, we could maybe enjoy a night in the suburbs, order in, rent a movie.
- No mission to worry about, just Mr. and Mrs. Carmichael.
- Maybe have some fun. Chuck, we can't go back there.
- It was just a cover.
- Yeah, I know that, I just thought that...
- Casey and I have to shut down the operation.
- Can we talk later?
- Absolutely.
- Uh, Chuck?
- Yeah.
- I'm going to need that back.
- Right.
- Almost forgot.
- Hey.
- How was the big date?
- Gentlemen, it was a night of exquisite passion.
- I did things with that woman I didn't even know existed, which are likely illegal. Yes! So you took our advice?
- I lied my ass off.
- What did we tell you? Way to get back in the game, chief.
- Enough chitchat. We're burning daylight.
- Lester, man the Nerd Herd desk.
- Jeff, help out the green shirts.
- I want the new inventory stocked by lunch.
- My store had better be shipshape.
- What, you're making us work?
- What about your new girlfriend?
- What about her?
- She's gonna be here any minute.
- I invited her down.
- Wow.
- Michael, what's going on?
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Because I work here.
- I am a manager at the Buy More, Bolonia.
- But I thought you were a boat captain.
- Shipping magnate, but that was something I just made up so I could get to do what we did last night.
- But after we did what we did last night, I...
- I can't bear to lie to you anymore, so I'll understand if you want to tell me where to shove it, but I hope you'll forgive me.
- I do forgive you.
- The truth is I wasn't 100% honest on my dating profile either.
- Aw, honey, I don't mind a little extra weight.
- I have a son.
- Oh, w-well, s-so what?
- I love kids.
- He's 26 years old.
- I thought you found out.
- I thought that's why you wanted to meet here in the store.
- I don't follow.
- Michael, my son works here.
- Please, Lord, let it be Bartowski.
- Mother.
- Mi hijo.
- Ah, yeah.
- ? I hijo?
- You're banging my mom?
- Hey.
- What did I tell you?
- House-sitting really changes things, huh?
- Absolutely, just-just not in the way you were hoping, El.
- To tell you the truth, the suburbs were kind of a disaster for me and Sarah.
- Well, what happened? What went wrong?
- I guess something that's been wrong from the start.
- You know?
- Are... you guys aren't breaking up, are you?
- No, no, no, no, no, trust me, Sarah's not going anywhere.
- Chuck, I guess I don't...
- I don't know what you're saying exactly.
- Look, El, I know how much you love Sarah and I know how much you love the idea of us and us moving forward with you and Devon, but we're not anything like you guys.
- But you guys seem so perfect.
- Yeah, I know, I guess, but being in that house with her, it was so close to being perfect... the way I had always pictured it would be... that I realized what was wrong with that picture.
- And it was us.
- Sarah and I are never going to be anything more than what we are right now.
- And you know what?
- I'm okay with that.
- Anyway... Agent Walker, you get everything you need?
- Yeah.
