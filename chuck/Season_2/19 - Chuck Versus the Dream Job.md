# Chuck Versus the Dream Job

- Hi, I'm Chuck. here are a few things that you might need to know.
- Is there any way that Intersect images can be taken out?
- Can it be removed? Only Orion would know.
- Orion.
- Hello, Chuck.
- It's good to finally see you face-to-face.
- Cards you're looking at are the schematics for the new Intersect.
- Study If you can find FULCRUM's Intersect, you could get your old life back.
- I promised Ellie that I'd find dad to walk her down the aisle but I've tried everything. He's nowhere; it's like he's fallen off face of the Earth.
- Dad.
- I'm sort of freaking out here.
- I know.
- But he's your father, and he seemed happy to see you.
- You think?
- I thought it was just lack of recognition followed by shock.
- You take cream?
- Yeah. No.
- Whatever's fine.
- I can't even rember if I take cream.
- Just relax.
- How?
- I- I haven't... I haven't seen my dad for, like ten years, and now I'm sitting in his living room/kitchenette while he's making us coffee.
- Plus, let's just say the last time I saw him, he was kind of--
- I mean, he tended to be a little, what's the word? Crazy.
- Here we go.
- Thanks.
- So good to see that face again.
- Yeah, yours, too.
- So, uh, you doing okay?
- Who cares about me?
- Tell me about you.
- Uh, well, you know, there's not, there's not much to tell.
- Graduated from high school.
- Went to Stanford. Work at Buy More.
- Stanford. Not bad.
- He always was a genius-- this one.
- No, not like you.
- You're right. He was smarter.
- What about Ellie? How is she?
- Really great, actually.
- Um, she's a doctor now. and-and in a few weeks, she's gonna get married to, well, a- an awesome guy.
- Ellie's getting married?
- She is.
- That, uh, that's actually mainly why we're here.
- Ellie was really hoping that you might be there to walk her down the aisle.
- I don't think she would want me there.
- I- I mean, of course, of course she does.
- We both do.
- It's not a good idea.
- But tell her that I'm happy for her.
- Are you, are you joking? You have to do this.
- She's your daughter. Don't you want to be there?
- Charles, I can't...
- I- I don't want to hear what you can't do.
- I've seen what you can't do.
- I'm sorry. I, uh...
- That came out wrong.
- No, it didn't.
- You're mad.
- I left, and-and you're mad.
- Look, Dad, I'm not even here for me really, okay?
- Right now, I just... I want you to come home for Ellie, please.
- I like you coming up here and fighting for Ellie.
- Makes me happy you at least had each other.
- Let me get a few things together.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.
- I mean, I'm glad we found him for Ellie.
- And for you?
- Yeah.
- Maybe he's not as crazy as I rembered.
- Steve: Okay. Let's go get your sister married, huh?
- Maybe we should wait till dark. They're... they're tracking my every move.
- Rat bastards.
***
- So, I was thinking that this would be perfect for the rehearsal dinner 'cause if I wear that sage dress, this will match perfectly.
- Sounds good.
- Ellie, hey.
- Hey, Chuck. Just a sec.
- We could do the cranberry, which would really bring out your, um, your...
- Hello, Eleanor.
- Aren't you gonna say something?
- Pancakes.
- Oh, boy.
- You said you were gonna make pancakes Well, that-that went well.
- You must be Devon.
- Yeah.
- Big TV.
- Ellie, I'm sorry.
- I should have called first.
- A surprise of this magnitude wasn't the best idea.
- No, it's not your fault.
- I'm just... so mad at him, our crazy old dad.
- Aren't you mad at him?
- I was, yeah.
- But then I realized that... you know, we can hate him for the rest of our lives, or we can choose to forgive him.
- It's easier to hate him.
- Well, that may be.
- But he's all we got left, El.
- This could be our last chance at being a family again.
- Let's go.
- I guess I was just, uh, surprised to see you, Dad.
- I'm sure you were.
- God, Ellie, y-you look just like your mother.
- Sorry I left you two alone like that.
- No, no, it's fine.
- Your dad was just explaining our television to me.
- I was telling, uh, Devon that, um, I practically invented your TV.
- I came up with these helix-shaped plasma crystals back in high school, um, never saw a dime for it.
- Okay, well, who's hungry? I'll order pizza.
- Touch-screen technology. That was one of mine.
- Uh, Ted Roark and I came up with it back in grad school.
- Dad, you went to school with Ted Roark?
- The Roark Instruments guy? Awesome.
- Yeah, he took all my ideas, and, uh, I-I never got anything.
- Guy's a lying thief.
- Well, how about I, uh, order the pizza. Pepperoni?
- Roark's releasing a new software this week that I guarantee has components that I helped develop.
- Yeah, pepperoni sounds great, hon.
- Steve: I still have my original touch-screen schematics.
- And I... I want to show you.
- Uh, D...
- Okay, guys, I'm really trying here, but he is obviously as crazy as we rember.
- Beckman: It seems Chuck's flash matches a lot of chatter we've been hearing about Roark Instruments lately.
- The CIA now believes Ted Roark's latest software may contain a virus that, if released, could cause irreparable damage to the world's computer networks.
- Why don't we just contact Roark and tell them our concerns?
- We can't out of fear of alerting those who might be involved.
- Instead, we're going to send in Chuck as a new RI employee.
- You will see if you flash on anyone or anything.
- Your interview is in one hour.
- Are you okay with that?
- Why wouldn't he be?
- Well, his dad went to school with Roark.
- There could be some history there.
- Your daddy issues gonna jeopardize our mission?
- No, no, I'm fine.
- Forget Apple. Forget Microsoft.
- I've dreamt of working for Roark since college.
- Although does it actually qualify as a dream come true if I go in as a janitor?
- You're going in as Charles Bartowski.
- Your name, your resume, your Stanford degree.
- Really?
- You're perfectly qualified to go in as yourself.
- Me at RI?
- You must be Chuck.
- I'm Drew.
- Welcome to Roark Instruments, where the future happens first.
- I love it here.
- Drew: Everyone does.
- Please, have a seat.
- Right. Uh, here, yeah.
- Sorry. I'm not nor...
- So, I see you went to Stanford.
- Me, too. Class of '07.
- '07, wow.
- You-you've only been out a couple of years?
- That's eons in the software game.
- Come on. Where you been?
- Seriously, tell me what you're up to since you graduated.
- Uh, well, uh...
- What have I been up to?
- Chuck, just be honest.
- Um, I've actually been working at a Buy More, um, in the Nerd Herd division, which, you know, has given me quite a bit of experience working with, you know, different computers, operating systems, technologies.
- You know, I've gotten the opportunity to work with many different unusual personalities.
- Good morning, Big Michael!
- Where the hell did you come from?
- We have a proposition for you.
- I'll pass. Excuse me.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Two words: NextExpo.
- That's one word.
- Stop counting.
- Tomorrow is Roark's Next Technology Expo where they're gonna be releasing their new operating system to the entire world.
- Now, we believe that attending that release will make us better employees.
- And better human beings.
- NextExpo, huh?
- Good thinking.
- Send Bartowski.
- Chuck's not here. -As usual.
- Okay, fine.
- You both can go.
- Have fun camping out at the weirdo convention.
- Chuck: I would say probably my greatest weakness is how little I pushed myself since college.
- I've been trapped in a job, a life that I don't really want, but don't really see a way out.
- Being here's a good start.
- Well, clearly, you're qualified.
- And it doesn't hurt that you're a fellow Stanford alum.
- I'd love for you to take the job.
- Really?
- Thank you so much!
- Congratulations, Chuck.
- Wow, thanks. Wait.
- Here we go.
- There we go.
- We'll work on those ball k*ll.
- Hey, what's that?
- The lobby.
- What's that?
- Elevator.
- What's that?
- The bathroom.
- Man, this place is awesome!
- Over there's R&D, and that hallway leads to our testing facilities.
- Sorry about the shortened tour.
- We've been so busy with this software release.
- All right.
- Right around here is...
- Hey, Ted, this is Chuck, our new employee.
- Hey, welcome to RI.
- Never wash that hand.
- I never will, sir.
- No "sirs" around here, except for her.
- Well, okay, Ted.
- It's just a... it's just an honor to be here and working for your company.
- Well, easy, big boy. You already got the gig.
- Ready to take over the world?
- Only 24 hours of camping and NextExpo is all ours.
- Welcome to the team.
- Happy to have you aboard.
- Oh, yeah.
- Think Morgan knows that Chuck's cheating on the Buy More?
- You know your boyfriend just took a job at Roark?
- Of course, I was the first one he told.
- You guys are over.
- Yeah, okay.
- It's weird. Even though I know it's not real, I am excited about this job.
- Chuck, you got to remember it's just an assignment.
- No, I know... I know what it is.
- I just...
- If I had gotten this job at Roark right after college, maybe I'd never become the Intersect.
- Then when my dad comes back after ten years, I can show him that I'm not just another loser working at a Buy More.
- Chuck, you're not a loser.
- Well, I'm sure he hoped I'd be doing something a little bigger than Nerd Herding.
- You are.
- Charles!
- Perfect timing, you two.
- Wow, I'm so...
- Been sitting, waiting!I'm sorry.
- Where you been?
- Ah, well, you know, working, saving the lives of small technological devices.
- Ellie: How about a toast?
- To family.
- Uh, Dad, we are extremely grateful to have you home.
- Yes, we are.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
- And here's to you and Devon.
- May you live happily together forever.
- You deserve it.
- Oh, thanks.
- When's the bachelor party?
- I, um, I already had it.
- And?
- How was it?
- Well, I don't really want to talk about it.
- Well, okay, I got one. How about to Chuck's new job?
- What? -That's what I hear.
- You know, Lester tells me that you're leaving your old buddy and the Buy More behind to go all corporate over at Roark Instruments, which, I get it, pretty cool.
- So good luck, buddy.
- Chuck, that's amazing.
- You going to work for Roark?
- The man who stole everything from me?
- Either this is a mission or you two are very good at hiding your hobbies.
- We're going in to retrieve the source code for the new operating system.
- Without it, Roark can't release the software or the virus.
- It's gonna take time to break in the secured vault.
- Look, we need you to keep an eye on Roark in case anything goes wrong.
- Keep an eye on Roark?
- Have a nice first day.
- Man: Everyone, welcome to NextExpo 2009.
- Everybody, stay in line.
- Chuck!
- Chuck!
- UCK He's already forgotten us.
- It's like he looked right through me.
- Hey, not to add any extra pressure to you guys, but there's a FULCRUM agent here.
- He's some kind of computer t*rror1st.
- Well, if FULCRUM is here, it's even more vital that we stop this launch.
- Arigato.
- In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.
- Then you better hurry up.
- Roark's about to take the stage.
- Computer Voice: Access denied. Have an amazing day.
- Damn it. I'm gonna need to do a patch.
- Dad, you're really not gonna watch that, are you?
- I have to watch Chuck's first day even if he is working for Roark.
- Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the architect of the digital age andTime magazine's Man of the Year: Ted Roark.
- Roark: Thank you. Welcome to NextExpo 2009!
- Or as I like to call it, "Ted Greets the Little People.
- You believe this guy?
- We've done some amazing things this year.
- At least I have.
- I mean, I traveled around the world in a hot air balloon... uh, bought another island.
- It's private. Don't visit.
- What else? Let's see.
- Oh, and we invented a new operating system that's gonna change the world!
- Let's not waste any more time.
- Do you have any idea how much money I'm losing just standing here?
- By pressing this button, RIOS will be released.
- The ole world will have access, free access to our latest software.
- It's happening.
- We're encountering security we've never seen before.
- Computer Voice: Access denied again. That's twice.
- Maybe I should call security.
- Please tell me that was a good "Uh-oh. You know I love a countdown!
- I'd like you to join me. Ready?
- Ten...
- There's a countdown happening.
- Okay, Chuck, listen, we cannot access the source code.
- You're gonna have to stop the release.
- But I could get fired!
- It's not your real job. Hurry. six, five, four, three, two...
- No, wait! -one!
- What the hell are you doing?
- Ellie: Is that Chuck?
- Wow, he's on stage.
- He must have gotten promoted.
- I don't want to rest right now, okay?
- Get off the stage.
- I, uh, I... I, uh, I can't. I can't.
- MAN 1: Get off the stage!
- MAN 2: Don't deny us our new software, nerd!
- You can't press that button.
- The CIA believes that your software has been infected with a virus that when released, will cause worldwide computer damage.
- Do you have any idea how crazy you sound?
- Yeah, I do. I do.
- But please, you have to believe me.
- No, I really... I really don't.
- I'm sorry for the little technical delay.
- It must be my rock star magnetism.
- It drives some people batty.
- Go, Chuck! -No, Chuck!
- Stop!
- That's great!
- That's my boy!
- Oh, no!
- And you call yourself a Stanford man.
- Roark: Let's get back to it.
- Three, two, one...
- Have you heard from my brother?
- Was I supposed to hear from your brother?
- Chuck is not picking up. Do you think he's in jail?
- Do you get a phone call when you're in jail?
- In the movies you get a phone call. I don't know.
- I'm going to call 411. Who do I ask for, the county jail?
- Ellie, I just worked an 18-hour shift.
- Now just slow down, honey. Tell me what happened.
- Chuck freaked out.
- He hopped on stage at some computer convention and tried to attack his new boss.
- What? Why would he do that?
- I have no idea.
- Although, we should probably ask my dad.
- Since obviously, you put him up to it.
- What?
- I didn't tell him to do anything.
- Come on, Dad. Why else would he throw away the job of a lifetime?
- Ted Roark isn't worthy of your brother or his talents.
- It was a lousy job.
- And what do you call working at the Buy More, Dad?
- Don't you get it?
- Chuck has been waiting for ten years to impress you, and now this opportunity comes along where he can follow through on some crazy, made-up vendetta of yours.
- Trust me, sweetie.
- Your brother knows what he's doing.
- You want me to trust you?
- Ellie, maybe your dad's right.
- Maybe-maybe Chuck has got a good explanation.
- Sure, Devon, I'm sure he does.
- He probably just forgot the whole thing happened, right?
- Just like at your bachelor party.
- I'm sorry. I don't want to drag us into this.
- I'm just really worked up right now.
- So I'm going to take a walk.
- Ellie... -Let her walk, Devon.
- Drink?
- No, no way. That's what got me in trouble in the first place.
- What do I do?
- You're asking the wrong guy.
- She's your daughter.
- Well, I can't take credit for her.
- The only thing Ellie owes me is a few well-deserved trust issues.
- You really want my advice?
- Don't walk out on your kids when you promised them pancakes for dinner. They... tend to take it badly.
- You're a... real straight arrow, aren't you?
- I used to be-- before this damn bachelor party.
- God, I'm such a jackass.
- Maybe.
- But that's not why Ellie's mad.
- She just doesn't want you to turn into me, which... take this as a compliment-- seems pretty damn unlikely.
- So come on, have a drink.
- To straight arrows.
- Okay, all right.
- Show me what you want me to do.
- Why did you send me these cards, Orion?
- Do you want me to build an Intersect or find an Intersect?
- ♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪
- Hey, I'm a little... I'm a little busy right now.
- Just give me one minute.
- And then you can go back to whatever you were doing.
- Ellie thinks you did what you did at Roark for me, ♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪
- Dad...
- Still my minute?
- I ruined every good thing that ever happened to me.
- My family, my job, my entire life, thrown away.
- I won't stand by and let the same thing happen to you.
- That's one torch I'd rather not pass.
- If working for Roark is-is that important to you, then I think you should fight for it.
- And don't let my past destroy your future.
- I miss getting advice from you.
- Well, my minute's up.
- You were in the middle of something.
- CHUUK Oh, my God.
- Roark has an Intersect.
- What?
- An Intersect-- Roark has one.
- He thinks Roark is hiding a supercomputer the size of a football field inside his office.
- Yes!
- Well, maybe.
- What exactly did you flash on?
- I...
- I...
- I didn't. I didn't, I didn't flash on anything technically.
- I was just thinking. But it makes sense.
- We know that FULCRUM is working on trying to implant intel into their agents, but they still need a supercomputer-- an Intersect-- to crunch all that data.
- Only someone like Roark could do that.
- Ted Roark is working for FULCRUM?
- Chuck: I know it sounds crazy, but what if RIOS is actually a Trojan horse?
- Like a virus designed to steal intel from the government, corporations, anybody, everybody.
- And you just thought this up out of the blue?
- No flash, no proof?
- Beckman will laugh in our faces.
- Guess the apple doesn't fall too far from the crazy tree, does it?
- Sarah: Sorry, Chuck.
- Sarah... think about what it could mean if Roark has an Intersect.
- I could finally get this thing out of my head.
- I need your help to break into Roark's office.
- Beckman's orders are clear.
- So are the consequences of not following them.
- I'm sorry.
- Cute outfit, Bartowski.
- Give me that back.
- First you tell me what it is.
- Interesting question.
- Those are designs for the Intersect.
- You stole Roark's designs.
- Orion's.
- He sent them to me before he died.
- There's a map hidden in the plans that matches to layout of Roark Instruments.
- Orion contacted you and you didn't tell us?
- I think he wanted me to break in.
- Yeah, and I want you to take off my gear before I break your geek neck.
- I know what I'm doing.
- You have no idea.
- You're entering a world of pain, Chuck.
- I want this Intersect out of my head.
- Are you going to help me or not?
- You got to be...
- Is that a tranq g*n?
- You don't even have the common courtesy to threaten me with an actual firearm.
- What's your answer, Casey?
- Put the toy down and get your ass back...
- I'm going to k*ll you when I wake up.
- Sorry.
- Come on. That's the oldest excuse in the book.
- Yes, he knows me.
- I want to see Ted Roark.
- He might have screwed me, but I'm going to let that son of a bitch screw my son.
- Get your hands off of me!
- Listen, you tell your boss I'm not leaving this building until my boy gets his job back!
- What are you doing, Dad?
- What do you want me to do with him?
- Man: Bring him in.
- We'll deal with it in private.
- Excuse me.
- Are you in charge of these meatheads?
- Dad, Dad, Dad, we have to go.
- We have to go right now.
- I can explain all of this to you later.
- For now all I can tell you is...
- I'm not who you think I am.
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see both of you.
- Don't worry, Charles.
- I'm not who you think I am either.
- Hands up.
- Are you coming?
- We should go, Charles.
- Oh, my God.
- You're Orion.
- We should hurry.
- Casey, where's Chuck?
- In a world of pain.
- I can't believe this.
- My father invented the Intersect.
- That's note. rue.
- I didn't invent all of it. Just...
- The really cool stuff.
- Come on.
- Granted, I can understand how this might complicate a few things. This way.
- What? Complicate a few things? Dad, I saw you die!
- I saw you explode in the helicopter.
- But I see how I could've given you that impression.
- I've had to die quite a few times.
- One of the perils of being Orion.
- This isn't what I wanted, Chuck.
- But when I realized what the government was going to do with the Intersect, I had to run.
- And your guys wouldn't be the only ones who are looking for me, and more importantly...
- I knew I had to stay away from you and your sister.
- Come on.
- Wait, Dad.
- You were protecting us?
- I knew I'd have to spend the rest of my life hiding from the Intersect, but...
- I never imagined that it would find you.
- It must be such a curse to have all those secrets trapped in your head.
- That's why I came back.
- That's why I let your handlers find me.
- It's my fault that FULCRUM's after both of us now.
- You wanted me to flash on your crazy schematics.
- You wanted me to break in here.
- Why didn't you just say who you were?
- Would you have trusted me?
- After not seeing me for ten years I just appear, bring you to RI and tell you that I can get the Intersect, which I also built, out of your head?
- What would you have said to that?
- That you were a little bit crazy.
- Exactly.
- Now, punch in the code or we'll be a little bit dead.
- Listen, no, Dad, you don't understand.
- It doesn't work like that.
- Unless it's in here, I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.
- I designed that computer in your head, son.
- Flash.
- And it'll be the last thing you ever have to flash on.
- Aces, Charles.
- That's the Intersect?
- My baby.
- My greatest creation.
- After you and your sister, of course.
- Let's make that the hot seat.
- We need to make some minor modifications to Roark's software.
- So, uh, what exactly does your new program do?
- Well, usually the Intersect works in the other way around, but I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be able to take out information.
- In theory. At least.
- What you're going to see are a bunch of encoded images that will cancel out the ones that you originally uploaded.
- Wait.
- Are you saying you're gonna overwrite my brain?
- That's a good way of putting it, yes.
- Ready?
- No.
- Your glasses.
- Oh, right.
- Good luck, Charles.
- Something's wrong.
- No, no...
- It's not working!
- No, it doesn't work.
- But I'm sure you'll have it up and running in no time.
- You always did have a way with machines, Orion.
- And remember? I always had...
- Well, I always had a way with the girls.
- Remember?
- Hey, come on, man. What's the matter?
- No hug for your old partner?
- No?
- I've been looking for you for a long time.
- The years have been unkind.
- I could offer you a good moisturizer.
- No?
- Put him on the helicopter.
- k*ll the CIA agent.
- He's my son.
- He's your son?
- Congratulations!That's great!
- I had no idea. k*ll the son.
- Wait, I-I'll...
- I'll build anything you want.
- Give FULCRUM their Intersect.
- But my son walks away from here.
- You'll build it either way.
- You're gonna torture me? After ten years away from my family?
- My son walks away!
- All right, all right.
- I'm not a monster.
- I'm a...
- Little bit of a monster.
- But today is his lucky day.
- g*n on the chopper!Let's go.
- Charles.
- Take care of your sister.
- No, wait...
- Take care of yourself.
- Dad?
- You can do this without me.
- I'm not gonna leave you.
- Remember when I told you not to trust your handlers?
- Maybe I was wrong.
- If your son's gonna walk, he should do it now.
- Good-bye, Chuck.
- No!
- In our raid of Roark Instruments, we failed to retrieve either the Intersect or Stephen Bartowski.
- Clearly, we recognize that FULCRUM's possession of Orion poses an unparalled security threat.
- You mean FULCRUM's possession of my father.
- I promise you.
- No one at the CIA knew your father's secret identity.
- I also promise to entrust his recovery to our best team.
- General, weare your best team!
- Can't believe I'm gonna say this.
- Chuck's right.
- No, you cannot put Chuck back in the field.
- It is too dangerous.
- FULCRUM knows that he is Orion's son.
- Look, as soon as my dad finishes the new Intersect for Roark, I'm worthless to you.
- Obsolete. And FULCRUM wins.
- The only thing that matters now is getting my father back.
- And you need me to do that.
- Very well, Mr. Bartowski.
- The assignment is yours provided your personal entanglements do not interfere with the mission.
- Dad?
- Ellie, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think your dad may have split.
- His stuff's all gone.
- Hey, hey, I'm sure he's planning on coming back for the wedding.
- No, no, he's not.
- Well, if it's any consolation, I'm not going anywhere.
- Ever.
- I mean, no matter how hard things get between us.
- Because that's what people do, right?
- Just think in 50 years, we'll look back at my bachelor party and laugh about it No, we won't Probably not Chuck, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah I'm fine, only my career was injured Chuck, um… Dad's gone I told him about what happened at your work today I think I said things that…
