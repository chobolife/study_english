# Chuck Versus the Colonel

- I'm Chuck.
- Here are some things that you might need to know, or maybe you just forgot.
- I'm not who you think I am.
- You're Orion.
- My father invented the Intersect.
- No hug for your old partner?
- I'm been looking for you for a long time.
- Put him on the helicopter, and k*ll his son.
- I overheard them say that they're moving your father to Black Rock.
- Black Rock is a code name for a secret Fulcrum base in Barstow.
- I'm shutting down this project. Chuck's going into lockdown.
- Operation "Moron" is over.
- They're gonna take you underground.
- We have to run. Your dad is still out there.
- You're committing treason. You could go to jail.
- I know.
- According to the coordinates, this should be Black Rock.
- It doesn't exactly look like a Fulcrum compound now, does it?
- Maybe your flash was wrong.
- No, they had to have just moved my father.
- These beer are fresh. There's still ash on the cigarette.
- Could have been kids having a party.
- Great.
- We've got to start all over again.
- Chuck, we're AWOL. It's why we ditched the car.
- If Casey finds us, I go to jail, you go to a padded cell with 24-hour surveillance.
- There is no going back.
- Don't give up, Charles.
- Cute couple.
- If anything happens to them...
- What are you going to do?
- You going to k*ll me? You going to b*at me to a pulp?
- I'm sure you can come up with something more creative.
- No, you... you had it right. I'll k*ll you!
- Forgot about that. I'm sorry. I'll tell you what.
- As long as the new Intersect is operational by tomorrow night, your son will be fine.
- Hold on.
- There's still a ton of diagnostics to run, simulations...
- I can't guarantee I can finish it by then.
- Well then, I can't guarantee your son's safety.
- The safety of the Intersect is no longer my main concern.
- I want you to hunt Agent Walker and the Asset down.
- Bring them back. Dead or alive.
- Understood, General.
- Once the Intersect is in our possession, this mission will be over and you will have your pick of assignments.
- Your country thanks you...
- Colonel Casey.
- Congratulations.
- You've earned it.
- Got it.
- What are you doing here, bro?
- Chuck hasn't been showing up.
- I was looking for some clues where he might be.
- Chuck, I just heard from him.
- Really? He just called?
- He left a voice mail not 5 minutes ago. Our wedding is this weekend and he decided to go out of town.
- Good. Glad to hear... hear he's safe.
- Sorry, nervous Nellie, I guess.
- Have a nice day!
- Babe, we've got to get a lock for that window.
- I need emergency satellite tracking on an unregistered line that dialed the following number 5 minutes ago.
- As you can see... just the one bed.
- A little presumptuous, I guess. Should I have asked for separate rooms?
- No. It's fine.
- As long as we're on the lam, I can't let you out of my sight.
- I'm going to take a shower.
- I'm going to assume that that whole out of sight thing doesn't really apply now.
- Right.
- I'm at the motel a mile south of the base.
- They just checked in. You want me to k*ll them?
- Vincent, I may need them for leverage.
- When the tests are complete, feel free to use whatever despicable acts of violence are in your nature.
- You could eat them if you want.
- I'll sleep on the floor.
- No, it's okay.
- Why are you doing this?
- Because the floor is gross, and I'm not going to make you sleep on it.
- No, why are you here, risking everything that you worked so hard for?
- Because, after everything that you've done for this country, you deserve to find your father, to get the Intersect out of your head and to have a chance at a normal life.
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.
- It's my job to protect you.
- What about when it's not your job?
- What happens to us then?
- One mission at a time, Chuck.
- Telecom tracking complete. Location verified.
- Gotcha.
***
- Friends?
- I wish people in our line of work could afford friends.
- That's just one of the sacrifices of upper management.
- Big Mike is my friend, and I never would have betrayed him if you hadn't tricked me.
- Really?
- Do all your friends give your mother urinary tract infections?
- Listen, Grimes. I am offering you a cup... up the corporate ladder.
- Dude...
- Now...
- I need a new assistant manager.
- Will you be my Ass Man?
- Are you kidding me?
- No. Never.
- And as far as friends go, I have Chuck, that's all I need.
- Don't move.
- Don't breathe.
- Just stay there. Stay. Stay.
- I'm going to k*ll you, Morgan.
- Dead man walking.
- What do you want?
- I want to speak to Michael.
- I want to clear the air.
- Come closer.
- Mike, I know that this... this whole thing is my fault.
- I never knew Emmett was trying to take over the store.
- Truth is, I just wanted you to stop dating my mother.
- You should be so lucky that a man of his stature would defile your mother.
- Sorry.
- Never take sides against the family again.
- Understood.
- What can I do to make it right? I'll do anything... stepfather.
- Michael, there's a mess that needs cleaning in bathroom stall 3.
- No, let me do it.
- I'll handle this.
- We all have to clean up our own messes in this world, son.
- This can stop anytime you want.
- All you have to do is accept my offer.
- Don't move. I'm going to be right back.
- I have very sensitive sinuses.
- 9 millimeters of hot lead should clear that right out.
- You really think you could run away from me? Let's go.
- What?
- Sarah had nothing to do with this. What's going to happen to her?
- Sir, we have an issue.
- I told her not to move.
- Chuck, let's go.
- Sorry, Casey.
- God.
- Fulcrum is here. We can't leave Casey.
- They're going to torture him.
- If we go back he's going to arrest us.
- Yes, I know. But we can't leave him.
- Okay, fine.
- One condition: you stay in the car.
- Deal.
- Going somewhere?
- We came back here for you because Fulcrum's here.
- Then we better get out of here.
- I'm not leaving without Sarah.
- You drive or I end you.
- End me? How're you going to do that?
- You have no g*n.
- You don't think I could k*ll you with my thumb or my elbow?
- Nerd bludgeoned by radiator?
- You can't k*ll me with that radiator.
- It is far too confined here for you to get the appropriate torque.
- I could strangle you with the handcuff chain.
- You could maybe do that.
- Too late.
- They got her. Let's go.
- I told you.
- I'm not leaving without Sarah.
- Stay down!
- Drop it!
- Can't do that, John.
- Guys!
- Let's just take a b*at here. Remember, we are a team.
- Stay in the car!
- Technically, I still have one foot in the car.
- How far you think you're going to get?
- Until we rescue Chuck's dad.
- You're out of b*ll*ts.
- It's over.
- On the ground.
- You two mind taking that outside?
- We're in a b*mb shelter.
- I'm sorry, Sarah.
- You didn't do anything wrong, Chuck.
- You trusted somebody who you thought cared about you.
- Look outside, Chuck.
- Look out the window.
- "Tron. "
- "Tron"! Did you see that? My father signaled me!
- Did you just flash?
- Come on. A midnight screening of Tron? My father had to have written that.
- Come on. We got to go back there! My father's there!
- Casey, please!
- I don't care.
- Something weird is going on.
- Have you seen Chuck? He didn't come home last night, Casey came by, said he was worried about him.
- I'm sure. Can't live without his precious Chuck.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- The guy's obsessed with him, a classic perv.
- No offense.
- Obsessed how?
- You want to see something really freaky?
- Dude keeps a Chuck diary.
- Bathroom visits... and duration.
- Keys, duct tape, high-grade chloroform...
- From one stalker to another, I'm impressed.
- You guys think this has something to do with Chuck missing?
- I don't care. No clue.
- You mind if I... get right?
- Casey, please!
- Excellent work.
- Thank you, General. - A CIA team is on their way to take Agent Walker and the Asset back to Langley.
- What about my father?
- Chuck received a signal from him.
- He believes there may be a mission tonight.
- We'll look into it, Ms. Walker.
- In the meantime, enjoy your last few moments in Burbank, Colonel Casey.
- Now I get it.
- Now I understand why you would betray your own team.
- I would never betray my team!
- You went AWOL.
- You betrayed me.
- Don't you ever forget that.
- So sorry, Colonel.
- But congratulations on that chicken franchise you always wanted.
- Keep talking...
- Stay on Beckman.
- It might be too late by midnight.
- Just make sure we don't give up on Chuck's father.
- If your dad's there... we'll keep him safe. You have my word.
- It's your neighbor, Devon Woodcomb. Door was unlocked.
- This is creepy.
- Is that Chuck's bedroom?
- Freakburger...
- I hate this whole family.
- Boss Man calling Ass Man.
- Radio check. The new automated have arrived, if you could please have Mike unload them.
- Hold on a second. You said that if I agreed...
- Into the headset.
- You said that if I agreed to be your Ass Man, you wouldn't make Mike do any more humiliating jobs.
- And you wouldn't fire him.
- Get it done.
- Good luck using automated checkout machines with no power.
- Where'd you get that?
- Casey's locker.
- Morgan's really turned into Emmett's stooge.
- This will show them who's really in charge.
- We did it.
- That way! Go!
- For whatever it's worth... if I have to spend the rest of my days in a dark, windowless room, I can't think of a better person to spend it with.
- That's not really how this works.
- We can't request a cozy little two-bed, two-bath cell?
- Two-bed?
- Electrical interruption. Auxiliary power activated.
- Quick, before the power turns back on.
- Is that Awesome?
- Ass Man!
- We are under siege!
- sh**t to k*ll!
- Well... Hey, there, Emmett.
- It is a good thing I installed those emergency generators.
- I underestimate you.
- That was awesome!
- Fire them.
- Move! Move!
- I saw you on the security cam!
- Stay calm.
- How're you doing?
- What are you doing here?
- We need to talk.
- I get it, dude. You know, there was a time in my life that I didn't have a lot going on either.
- Dead-end job, no girl...
- Really?
- Well, no, John.
- But this is not the answer. Okay?
- You need help, bro. You need serious psychiatric help.
- What are you doing, man? ! Put the g*n away, dude!
- Take another step and I will drop you.
- Not bad for a frat boy.
- Don't you move.
- What the... ? !
- What the hell is going on here?
- Don't freak out.
- This is crazy. We've got to call the police.
- We can't do that. Here, drink this.
- He tried to k*ll me!
- Why can't we call the cops?
- Because I am the cops.
- Moron.
- I am a high-level CIA asset and these are my handlers.
- For the past 2 years, they've had to protect my every move.
- He can handle it.
- You can handle this, right? Tell me you can handle this.
- You're being serious?
- He's being serious?
- I need you to help me.
- I need you to be cool about this.
- I need you to cover for me with Ellie.
- I need you... to be Awesome.
- Can you be Awesome?
- You're a spy, Chuck?
- Yeah, more or less, yeah.
- This is...
- Awesome!
- I knew you weren't a loser who worked at the Buy More.
- "Loser's" a little... that's a little harsh.
- Here's the thing... the Buy More actually is real.
- But here's the most important thing. I need you to do this for me right now.
- I need you to go home and handle Ellie.
- That is your mission.
- Can you do that?
- I got your back, bro.
- Right, right.
- A spy!
- Keep that on the D. L.
- Impersonating a military official's a federal offense, numbnuts.
- Put it on the list.
- Don't you leave me here We got to go.
- You walk out that door, you're a dead man.
- I don't care.
- You will care.
- I smell bacon.
- Anyone else smell pig?
- I seem to detect the faint odor of the forbidden meat.
- Knock it off. Listen to me.
- You need to apologize to Emmett for blowing the power, otherwise he's going to can you.
- Nice try.
- Get us to apologize so we look like asses.
- Lose all our street cred.
- You're going to have to accept 1 concept.
- What's that?
- No one on this planet is as dumb as you are.
- I'm trying to help you guys.
- Are you?
- Why are you taking all this crap from everyone?
- What choice do I have?
- Emmett is trying to fire the entire store, I am the glue that holds it.
- Why do you care if this store holds together?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, don't you have some goal in this world outside the store?
- Even Jeff and Lester have their ridiculous band.
- Don't you have a dream?
- Of course, I do. It's just...
- What?
- It's crazy and you'll laugh at me.
- I promise, I won't laugh.
- Promise?
- I'd like to be a Benihana chef... in Hawaii.
- I know. It's stupid.
- It's not stupid.
- It's totally attainable.
- No, it's not.
- You have to train for, like, years, okay?
- I'm way past my prime, I am not Asian and I don't even know where to get the knives.
- Ass Man, I need you.
- Ass Man on his way.
- We ran a thermal satellite scan of the coordinates, and activity was present.
- It seems Fulcrum has moved their operation underground.
- Bartowski was right. We sending in a team to rescue his father?
- We don't have time for that. I've ordered F-16s to annihilate the site.
- But I gave my word.
- I have not come to this decision lightly.
- We have no other choice.
- Chuck's a spy.
- Stay cool.
- There you are.
- Did you learn anything about Chuck at the Buy More?
- He's supposed to pick up your parents at the airport.
- Honey? Why are you just looking at me like that?
- It's a really simple question. Have you talked to Chuck?
- He's fine, yeah.
- So you spoke to him?
- Definitely not.
- Someone else spoke to him?
- Who?
- Honey.
- I need you to focus, okay? No wedding day jitters!
- We've got company coming any moment, my father and my brother are MIA, so I just need you to pull it together.
- Can you be Awesome for me?
- Good.
- You focus! Focus! I need your A game.
- No g*n for me?
- No. You get to stay in the car.
- The whole stay in the car bit? Aren't we past this?
- I think I'm perfectly capable of handling myself on a mission.
- What, Agent Imbecile?
- Drop it.
- You drop it.
- No! I've come this far. If he stop me, he'll have to k*ll me.
- Beckman called an air strike. It'll be here in 20 min.
- What? Casey, my father is here! You said you would rescue him.
- You gave me your word.
- But that didn't meant something. I guess I have a lot to learn.
- Yeah, you do.
- You made three crucial mistakes.
- You don't realize you were being trailed for last half hour, you didn't bring nearly enough firepower, and you didn't ask me to join.
- Would you like to help us rescue my father?
- Your father served the country honorably and deserves to go to the wedding.
- It's a yes?
- But, he stays in the car.
- Agreed.
- Done.
- The team's back together again! Group hug!
- One more step, it'll be your last.
- In the car I go.
- Aces, Charles. Aces.
- How's my favorite underachieving, reclusive, kidnapped scientist?
- It's done. There's your Intersect.
- You're a dream.
- There is... one request.
- Anything that won't inconvenience me is fine, I don't care.
- Leave my family alone.
- I'm not invited to the wedding?
- How did you know... ?
- I'm in a conglomerate of bad guys.
- Few details escape me.
- Stevie, this works, you have nothing to worry about. It's a little tart in here.
- I'll send down some air freshener.
- Definitely staying in the car.
- I had no idea Tron was so popular.
- Welcome! I see you all found your way.
- Directions were good.
- You have all have been carefully selected by Fulcrum to be the next generation of Intersect agents.
- More capable than any computer.
- More efficient than any spy in history.
- Welcome to the future! Can you dig it?
- That's not what I was hoping for.
- Can you dig it?
- My God!
- He's using the Intersect to build an army.
- Can you dig it? !
- The program will begin in three minutes.
- 3 minutes.
- You fellas have a cigar for me?
- Don't you hate smoke?
- I figure if I'm gonna die, I might see what all the fuss is about.
- Keys.
- Go! There's an air strike headed this way.
- Three minutes to target, general. Prepping w*apon systems.
- "Gone to stop Roark. Be back in five. Chuck. "
- I'm gonna k*ll him.
- Don't worry, Agent Casey, we'll take care of that.
- The prodigal son returns.
- Thank you for saving me the trouble of hunting you down.
- My pleasure.
- Move it.
- Great, the gang's all here.
- It's only fair that a son should see the results of his father's labor.
- Of course if this doesn't work, I'm afraid I have to go back to that bit where I k*ll everybody.
- If it does work?
- If it does work, Same result, but, you should root for it.
- I mean, nobody likes a cynic.
- Let's get right to the countdown, shall we?
- Five... four...
- Three... I'm excited.
- Two...
- Casey! Sarah! Shut your eyes!
- Keep them closed.
- Chuck, look at the screen.
- No, Dad, I don't want a refresh. I want this nightmare to be over.
- I know, that's why I made this for you. It's all for you.
- Trust me, son.
- What a rush! What a rush!
- I got to flash.
- I got to flash.
- I'm not flashing. I'm not flashing! It's not working!
- There must be a glitch. I'll have to take it back to the lab.
- No more labs!
- A deal is a deal!
- Your son is dead! Get him up.
- What's that?
- I've got Chuck. Let's get out of here. Come on!
- Chuck, are you okay?
- I feel...
- I feel different. Lighter.
- It worked.
- What worked?
- This.
- I programmed it to remove the Intersect from Chuck's head.
- What do you mean "remove"?
- The Intersect is out.
- It's over, Chuck.
- You're free, son.
- Colonel Casey, am I to understand that you rescued Mr. Bartowski, recovered the Intersect cube and destroyed Fulcrum's operation base?
- That's correct. - I should be promoting you to general.
- Actually, Walker's the one responsible for the success of the mission.
- She pretended to go AWOL.
- Used herself and the asset as bait to lure Fulcrum out so we could secure their location.
- She risked her life to the integrity of the mission.
- If anyone deserves a commendation, it's Walker.
- Actually, General, I never...
- Never thought she could be so cold. I mean, I didn't, certainly.
- She used me as bait, like Casey just said.
- Treated terribly, you know.
- She cuffed me, I had chaffing on my wrists.
- I was malnourished.
- It was... it was... horrific.
- Well, then, Colonel Casey, now that the "Intersect project" is over, I assume you want to command your old unit?
- Sorry, I just want to make sure I didn't misinterpret anything.
- Did you just say "over"?
- That's correct. We have the Intersect cube, Fulcrum is defeated, your mission complete.
- Mr. Bartowski, you are free to return to...  whatever it is you do.
- General, I'd... I'd just like to say that although I know we've had our share of ups and downs, this has been an incredible, dare I say, life-changing experience... that you don't feel quite as strongly about. I get it, you busy.
- Government... It's a little rude.
- Why are the Brothers Imbecile still working here?
- Can we just give them one more chance, please?
- You know what, Grimes, I'm gonna ask you a very important question.
- And I want you to think very long and hard, about it.
- Do you want to be a loser the rest of your life?
- Excellent question.
- If you had asked me that this morning, I probably would have said yes.
- Now, I'm not so sure.
- Then do what needs to be done.
- Yes, sir.
- Big Mike, in the old country, if a man did the honorable thing and he fell on his own sword, his family was looked after.
- That was a good break.
- Real nice deal.
- Will you look after my mother?
- I will.
- Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure serving with you.
- If you retell the story, do me a favor give me a better physique.
- What are you doing?
- Morgan out.
- Will you come to Hawaii with me, where I will learn the ancient art of hibachi?
- Morgan, I thought you'd never ask.
- This is so great.
- One second, hold on.
- A little hot in here, buddy?
- It's a bit chilly but... worth it.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. No, dude, actually, for the first time, everything is fine.
- It's all over.
- God, I admire him.
- You're free, Morgan!
- You're free!
- Babe, we are late. We have to go.
- I can't.
- We have a rehearsal dinner full of people waiting for us.
- I knew that my dad would disappoint me, but, not Chuck.
- I don't know, it must be in the DNA.
- I know it's difficult without Chuck, but he wants to be here, I know he does.
- Your dad leaving shook him up pretty bad.
- Ellie, he'll be back.
- Trust me... he loves you.
- So do I.
- Chuck, where have you been?
- I was getting your wedding present.
- Dad...
- Are you staying?
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I got your back, bro.
- I was wondering if you... wanted to come to my sister's rehearsal dinner.
- The Intersect's out, Bartowski.
- You don't need my help anymore.
- I'm not asking you as the asset, but as a friend.
- Okay, well, I tried.
- Open bar, I hope.
- I'll go warm up the Vic.
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.
- Very dapper.
- Thank you.
- So how does it feel?
- It feels great, actually.
- Like everything is finally real.
- It is real.
- Where you headed?
- Got a wedding to go to.
