# Chuck Versus the Lethal w*apon

- Hi, I'm Chuck. Here's a few things that you might need to know. I'm not a FULCRUM agent.
- I'm MI6 working undercover.
- I want to apologize to you directly, Agent Barker.
- We had no record you were MI6.
- Locked up in this dungeon's like keeping a Botticelli in the basement.
- No one can appreciate the beauty.
- I'm moving out.
- Yes!
- And moving in with Morgan.
- No!
- I'm the Intersect.
- No, he's not. It's me.
- If you know who Chuck really is, then you pose a security threat.
- If I proved anything to you by now, it's that I can keep my word. - Cole's been captured.
- You need to go into 24-hour protective detail.
- What exactly does that mean?
- We have to move in together.
- He's a really tough guy. Maybe he won't talk.
- Chuck, everyone talks.
- What's your real name?
- Bond, James Bond.
- How much does the CIA know about Perseus?
- Oh, come on, not the face.
- Ahh!
- I'm only going to ask you one more question.
- You answer it, and we're done.
- Who is the Intersect?
- ♪ ♪
- Morning, Chuck.
- How'd you sleep?
- Fine, thank you.
- Well, busy day. Lots to do.
- Uh, so, shower. Do you want to go first or... ?
- I'm good.
- You know, I know this whole 24-hour supervision thing isn't exactly great, but when the CIA finds us a new apartment, at least we'll have separate rooms.
- Sounds great.
- I mean, consider yourself lucky.
- At least you didn't have to move in with Casey, right?
- Yeah.
- Lucky me.
- Mm, spearmint okay?
- Yeah, fine.
- Traditionally, I'm a peppermint man, but I'm living on the edge.
- Sarah, can I ask you a question?
- About the toothpaste?
- Uh, no. Are you, you worried about Cole?
- Uh... of, of course I'm concerned about Cole.
- But Agent Barker can certainly take care of himself.
- Yeah, I get that.
- It's just, you know, you guys had this connection.
- I mean, he saved your life and you shared a bit of torture.
- Uh, our connection was purely professional.
- That's it.
- Oh, okay.
- Thanks, honey.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hi! Good morning!
- Whoa!
- Oh!
- Oh! Sorry, sorry.
- I'm just, I'm very excited for Chuck, for the both of you to be moving in together.
- It's still happening, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
- Absolutely.
- Great. Did you find a place yet?
- Not that I'm trying to rush you or anything.
- Take your time, bro. No pressure.
- You two lovebirds need to find a nest where you can let the worm wiggle free.
- Thank you, Devon.
- Do you need any help packing or throwing things away?
- Sarah, please tell Chuck that not everything in that room has to survive the move.
- I'm making a list.
- Making, uh, making a list, are you?
- And of what, may I ask?
- Oh, well, where should we begin?
- Maybe the Tron poster that you've had since you were 12.
- Dad gave me that poster, .
- I know. He loved that movie.
- Have you had any luck finding his address for the wedding?
- No, not yet, but you know, I'm, I'm working on it still.
- So, uh, how did Morgan take the news that he wasn't gonna get you as a new roommate?
- I didn't tell him yet.
- I don't have the heart.
- Morgan Grimes is so tired of listening to Big Mike punch his mama's time clock that he actually showed up for work on time today.
- Oh... !
- Okay, okay, well, Morgan Grimes is so disturbed by what Big Mike is doing to his mama that the thought of Jeff doing the same thing to Anna is actually sweet, sweet relief.
- Oh... !
- Oh, snap.
- That's good. Laugh it up, fuzzballs.
- That's right, sure.
- But guess what. I just landed the whale, 'cause me and my man Chuck, we're gonna be roommates.
- So, yeah, yeah, have your fun. Have at it.
- But don't expect any housewarming invitations from me.
- Don't give me that face.
- Hey, Morgan, buddy, hey, we got to talk.
- Yeah, you're just the man I wanted to see.
- Listen, I found a place.
- Dude, are you ready? Two bedroom, one-and-a-quarter bath, half a fireplace.
- About the apartment.
- Yeah, dude, I know. You and I, roommates.
- This is great. We're living the dream, Chuck.
- It's what we always talked about.
- The thing is, the thing is, th-there is...
- Bartkowski, my office now!
- When did you get an office, John?
- Hey, what's going on? We moving?
- No-tell motel time for Chuck.
- A secure bunker in an undisclosed location.
- Seriously, what's with the boxes?
- Cole Barker was picked up 12 hours ago by FULCRUM.
- We spent the entire night looking for him and failed.
- Langley thinks when he talks.
- They're gonna come here looking for you.
- We're taking you off the grid.
- Wait, what about my sister? Is she in danger?
- Awesome, Morgan?
- First priority is to get you safe.
- Then I'm gonna come back and make sure everybody else is okay.
- If we get that far.
- This 240-27. We have a perimeter breach.
- This is it. I'm gonna die underneath a yogurt shop.
- Back door now.
- Move, move, move.
- Sarah, Sarah, we need to talk.
- If I knew this was gonna happen...
- Later.
- Chuck, get back!
- Cole? panting)
- Take this.
- Did you miss me?
- Don't worry. I didn't say a word.
- Look at that.
- Maybe you're not going away after all.
- Lucky you.
- Yeah.
- Lucky me.

- Hey!
- After that, it was eight, maybe nine guys until the door.
- Oh, come one.
- We're supposed to believe that he took out nine guys and escaped a FULCRUM holding facility all by himself.
- Please, I don't think we can trust this guy.
- I've done nine before.
- You've taken out nine guys?
- Just saying it's doable.
- So when they questioned you about the Intersect...
- I didn't tell them anything.
- It's not my first dance, Walker.
- If I talked, then Chuck, Casey, you... are all in the crosshairs.
- Not an option.
- Why come back here after you escaped?
- I wanted to make sure you were safe.
- You are the sexiest man in the world.
- For you.
- It's our 16-month anniversary.
- Wait a minute. We had a "no gift" policy.
- I didn't get you anything.
- Morgan, you're the worst person at keeping secrets.
- I already know what you got me.
- You left the lease for our new apartment in the fax machine.
- A life together is the best present ever!
- And when we move in, I'm gonna show you your mother isn't the only one who can be noisy in the bedroom.
- I gotta go call my parents.
- I thought you were moving in with Chuck?
- I am. We are. Anna misunderstood.
- She found the lease. Now she thinks...
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, buddy, you are screwed.
- No, actually, I think if I tell the truth at this point, it'll end the sexual component of our relationship.
- Mm.
- And I'll be there to pick up the pieces.
- What?
- Shh-shh-shh, relax, Morgan.
- All you have to do is convince Anna that moving in with you is a bad idea.
- Okay, but how am I gonna... ?
- Sh-sh-shh, bubeleh,  you've come to the right place.
- Repulsion is our business.
- And business is good.
- Thanks to information provided by Mr. Barker, we now know that FULCRUM is protecting a man that goes by the code name "Perseus. "
- Perseus is the head scientist behind FULCRUM's effort to build their own Intersect.
- Anything, Chuck?
- I spent the past year undercover trying to get close to him, but only the inner circle is ever allowed contact with the man.
- Intel tells us Perseus is attending a formal event tonight at the Swiss Consul's office.
- The State Department has arranged invitations for the two of you.
- Um, the two, the two of who?
- Agent Walker and Agent Casey.
- Are you sure, General?
- I'd be happy to accompany Agent Walker.
- I bet you would.
- I'd be happy to go, too.
- Oh, aren't you popular?
- I mean, you know, I am, I am the Intersect and everything.
- Neither Agent Barker nor Bartkowski will be going on this mission.
- FULCRUM is still actively searching for the two of you.
- Both of you will stay in CASTLE and monitor by remote feed.
- If you recognize anyone, you'll have radio.
- Well, at least no one's telling us to...
- You heard the General. You stay in the bunker.
- And there it is.
- Phase one of operation repulsion: the obscure and disturbing hobby.
- Take that, you chauvinist pig.
- Told you not mess with Billie Jean.
- You bitch.
- Hey, Morgan, I'm done for the day.
- You want to take me over, show me the new apartment?
- Uh, you know what, I'd love to, hon, but we're in the middle of recreating some of the best tennis matches ever played, and I'm up next.
- McEnroe, Stockholm, '84.
- You can't be serious.
- Yes!
- Look on the bright side.
- When we move in together, you can play, too.
- It will be like a nonstop Wimbledon final in our living room.
- Doubles anyone?
- Ugh.
- That's, that's, that's 95% alcohol.
- Don't touch me with that.
- Video check.
- Do we have a signal?
- Yep, we got you.
- And you look fantastic.
- Sarah, is that dress CIA issue, or do you just make everything look that good?
- Let's stay focused here, people, huh?
- We are on a mission.
- You do look gorgeous, Sarah.
- This is Chuck speaking by the way.
- Okay, too many cooks in the kitchen.
- Chuck, you get in Casey's ear, I'll get in Sarah's.
- Okay, you two, split up.
- Sarah, you've got an unsecured exit at 2:00.
- The guy in the bad suit standing in front of the Swiss flag is packing.
- Casey, you got a bogey.
- A tray of crab cakes coming in on your 10:00.
- I'm just trying to be helpful, okay?
- Works up an appetite on missions.
- Grab that little...
- Sarah, the Italian minister for trade is headed your way.
- Now he can get a little handsy.
- Hello.
- I'm Paolo Giordano.
- I saw you arrive and couldn't help but admire your beauty.
- His wife's name is Isabella and he has three little bambinos.
- Thank you.
- How are Isabella and the children?
- Senorina.
- Nicely done.
- Not so bad yourself.
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Just, uh, just doing our job.
- Me and Cole, Cole and me.
- Take your victory lap later, Bartowski.
- Who else haven't we seen?
- I don't know, look at the people by that ice goose thing.
- Oh, okay, I just flashed.
- The shorter balding gentleman in the sweater wearing the glasses-- that has got to be Perseus.
- I have a visual. Moving in.
- His name is Howard Busgang.
- He's a research scientist with the Department of Defense.
- Good job, Chuck.
- I have a few k\*ll of my own now, don't I? Humph.
- So nine guys, huh?
- Really, you're not fudging that number?
- Not even a little bit? Sounds harder than it is.
- Always go for the knee.
- You mean like sweep the leg?
- Ooh. Ooh, I'm sorry.
- Excuse me. That's him.
- Well, yeah. You're a little late to the party.
- I just flashed. No, not Busgang, him.
- He was the guy who was torturing me.
- He's Fulcrum.
- You two have a nice evening.
- You, too.
- Where'd they go?
- Where'd they go?
- Where'd they go? !
- My guess is that Fulcrum made them, and they just jammed the signal.
- Oh, uh, Dr. Busgang.
- I don't believe we've meet before.
- How do you do?
- Your friends are in trouble.
- I've gathered that. We have to call General Beckman.
- For what?
- So she can tell us what to do next.
- I'll tell you what we do next.
- We go to the consulate and we save them.
- No, no, no, no. Sarah and Casey specifically said for us to stay here.
- Yeah, well, sometimes things don't always go according to plan, Chuck.
- You have to improvise.
- Look, you can't just go run off and be the hero all the time.
- It's not about wanting to be a hero, Chuck.
- It's about needing to be.
- Two g\*n, huh?
- Oh, you really are a badass.
- No, Chuck, one g\*n.
- The other one... is for you.
- Let's go.
- Normally we stay in the service arena-- waiter, busboy, maybe valet.
- How about we mix it up this time?
- What do you think about dentists?
- Dentists at a consulate party?
- You got a better idea?
- I say we go as spies.
- It's a little obvious, but I guess we can do it your way.
- ... but the data acquisition problem in Minsky's "society-of-mind" theory was addressed in large part by Singh's "E-M-One" paper back in... 2005.
- Sounds fascinating.
- Mm. Yes. More champagne?
- Please.
- Radio's still out. Let's grab this guy and get out of here.
- Now, where was I?
- You were telling me about all the wonderful work you do for the government.
- Right.
- That sounds fascinating.
- I'd like to hear about that, too.
- You going to knock him out, too?
- There are civilians everywhere.
- We have to find another way in.
- We should have called Beckman, had her send a team.
- And miss out on all this fun?
- Come on, get in the game, Chuck, before Fulcrum takes out your team.
- I think they already have.
- Oh, you-you can't be serious.
- There's got to be a ground floor option.
- This is good. We're going up here.
- Damn.
- Damn it.
- Cole, Cole, you're bleeding.
- No, I'm fine.
- No, you're not. No, you're not.
- Get... get... What are you doing, Chuck?
- What do you mean what am I doing? I'm doing this.
- Duncan, what's with the g\*n?
- Who are these people?
- Not your concern, Howard.
- We work for the government, Dr. Busgang.
- So do I. Tell them, Duncan.
- We work for the CIA.
- The men you work for are t\*rrorists.
- We're not t\*rrorists.
- We're patriots, Howard.
- You're a patriot.
- It's a group of spies that turned your back on the country.
- You couldn't have it more wrong.
- Who do you think we are? We do what needs to be done to preserve this nation's rightful place in the world.
- Someday, you'll thank us.
- Well, not you-- you'll be dead.
- I swear I'm just a scientist.
- They said I was helping the country.
- Unfortunately, Howard, that was the wrong thing to say.
- Hey, Cole, Cole, hey!
- I found them, I found them.
- The guy who tortured you is inside with a couple of other big g\*ons with g\*n.
- Okay, give me 20 seconds, then you go in there, start taking guys out, okay?
- No, wait, wait, wait!
- Listen, about the whole-- about the whole g\*n thing--
- Casey and Sarah, they've never really let me--
- I don't-- how do I say this? -- I've never fired one.
- Chuck, it's point and click.
- You point at the bad guys, pull the trigger.
- Yes, I get the whole concept. Still...
- 20 seconds.
- Wait...
- We're dead.
- Bartowski's got a g\*n.
- It's a shame, Howard.
- Five, six...
- You really do have an incredible mind.
- Uh... t-twenty.
- Freeze!
- Federal Agent!
- Ow!
- I'm hit!
- Man down! Man down!
- I'll take care of Chuck.
- Get the doctor!
- Sarah!
- Sorry about that.
- I'm really not normally this aggressive with women.
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.
- You've been sh\*t.
- I'm fine.
- Gu... Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hey, guys, I think, uh... I think I might need medical attention. My ankle is seriously...
- Cole took a b\*llet to save Sarah.
- Wow. Uh...
- You okay, buddy? What happened?
- Nothing.
- Nothing. I'm f... I'm fine.
- Really. Never mind.
- What's that, mahogany?
- You don't look so good.
- Can't say the same for you.
- Be gentle now.
- I bruise easy.
- Well, then maybe you should consider taking better care of yourself.
- Aah.
- This might hurt a bit.
- You know, I've been poked at by more spook doctors than I care to remember.
- It's nice to be looked after by someone who treats you as more than just a name, rank and serial number.
- I know what you mean.
- Okay, now, just relax.
- Mm.
- Aah.
- Hold that.
- Thanks, doc.
- Well, thank you for saving my life.
- What was I gonna do, not see you again?
- Hey.
- Howdy. How you doing in here?
- Right. Absolutely. Yeah, sorry about that.
- I was just come... coming by to see if you guys needed anything.
- Cole? Soup?
- A bisque of some kind? Or an US Weekly?
- I don't read it myself, but I hear that when you're sick or injured...
- Walker! Barker!
- Bartowski.
- Mm-hmm.
- Briefing in five.
- Also that briefing in five.
- That was kind of a business thing.
- I'll see you in five.
- It's like four-and-a-half now.
- Oh, that's the ankle. That's the ankle.
- What are you reading there, sweetie?
- Did you know IKEA sells 17 kinds of home shelving?
- I can only pronounce two of them, though.
- Isn't it silly?
- Listen. You know what?
- I wanted to apologize about last night and the whole Wimbledon thing.
- I guess I was just trying to set some boundaries before we move in, and I realize there is a more mature way to handle this.
- You know? So, uh, well, there you go.
- A Morgan nuptial?
- Right.
- I had Lester's cousin draw it up for us.
- A little something to ensure that there are no cohabitating conflicts.
- No pets?
- What about Chico?
- Oh, that's right. Chico.
- I guess you have to put him down now, huh?
- The only cheese allowed in the house is string.
- Or gouda.
- On weekends.
- Are you insane?
- Just a teensy-weensy bit particular.
- And listen to me.
- I would totally understand if you're having second thoughts.
- Are you kidding me?
- Morgan, you're hilarious.
- I'll sign whatever you want.
- Maybe it makes me nuts, too, but I love you, ridiculous quirks and all.
- I should have that framed.
- Totally.
- Damn it.
- I should have went with provolone.
- Mr. Barker, I understand you were hurt protecting Agent Walker.
- I am told you showed great courage.
- Just doing my job, General.
- Actually, it was Chuck who showed great courage on this mission. He was also injured in the line of duty. He got clipped by a window sill.
- It's as pathetic as it sounds.
- Is there any new intel on Busgang or his FULCRUM handler, General?
- We now know that the man Chuck identified last night, Dr. Howard Busgang, is in fact codenamed Perseus.
- He is a former DARPA scientist who worked on the original Intersect.
- Uh, why was that information not in my flash?
- As a safety precaution, anything about the creators of the Intersect was redacted from our files.
- I'm sorry. Did you just say this guy created the Intersect?
- He was part of the team that developed its underlying architecture.
- He knows as much about how it works as anyone.
- That means he might know how to get it out of my head.
- We don't know, Chuck.
- But it's possible?
- Perhaps.
- We got to find him.
- We got to find this guy before FULCRUM does.
- We are putting every available resource on it, Chuck.
- Agents Walker and Casey, prepare for a video link.
- You're going to brief our field agents, bring them up to speed.
- Good luck.
- Roger that.
- Oh, let me...
- Hey, what are you looking at there?
- Oh, just, you know, footage from the consulate.
- Maybe there's something I missed.
- You did great tonight, Chuck.
- Thanks.
- You were your usual superhuman self.
- You saved Sarah's life.
- No.
- It was a team effort.
- I get what she sees in you, you know.
- The fearlessness in the face of danger, the imperviousness to pain. super-cool t\*nk tops.
- Stop me whenever this is getting uncomfortable.
- No.
- Hey. The briefing is about to start.
- Great. I'll be right there.
- On my way.
- Oh, you meant him.
- Of course you meant him.
- What?
- Right.
- My God, could she really be...
- Un-repulseable?
- I'm beginning to think so.
- No, sir.
- Not on my watch.
- What are you suggesting?
- Mm-mmm.
- You're going to need a quart of peanut oil, some bubble-wrap, and as much yarn as you can find.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Morgan, we need to talk.
- Yeah. Hey, what's going on?
- And what's with the limp?
- Nothing. No, I twisted my ankle.
- Ooh. Yeah. Jogging.
- Which I do, occasionally. I'm fine.
- We need to talk about...
- About the Anna situation?
- Not a problem, Charles.
- We are on it.
- You are looking at three individuals gifted in the art of repulsion.
- Anna doesn't stand a chance.
- Why are you trying to repulse Anna?
- No, no, no. Lester, that's ridiculous.
- What I was trying to do was simply test her.
- That's all.
- Testing her, why?
- Because, Chuck, because she's trying to get all serious with me, and I want to make sure that she loves me for me and not...
- Other things.
- Excuse us.
- Are you crazy?
- What other things could she possibly be loving you for?
- I mean, honestly, buddy.
- You know that I love you, but-but you're lucky to have a girl in your life who loves you for you, even though you are, in fact... you.
- Fair.
- I you don't stop testing her, she's going to choose to be with someone else.
- And then you will have realized, and unfortunately, too late, that you lost the catch of a lifetime.
- Counterpoint: she's not the catch of a lifetime.
- She's a scheming tart who will harvest your organs and sell them to the highest bidder.
- Chuck's right.
- Lester wrong.
- Chuck.
- What happened?
- Nothing. It's a flesh wound.
- It's nothing. I'm fine.
- Well, let's see. Sit down.
- Up, up.
- Sorry, sorry. Devon, can you help?
- Please promise not to go all crazy Dr. Sister on me.
- What's up, babe?
- We need to get Chuck to the hospital.
- We got to X-ray this leg.
- No, we don't. I'm fine.
- Pretty swollen there.
- I'm actually a lot tougher than people think I am.
- I know you are, buddy.
- Sometimes it takes a real man to admit when you're hurt.
- Ouch.
- That actually hurt.
- I didn't think anything hurt you.
- Oh, no, there are some things.
- The clinical disinterest of a beautiful woman, for instance.
- Any word on Busgang?
- Not yet.
- Casey and I are headed to the airport.
- They think Busgang might try to leave the country.
- All right, then.
- Rest up.
- Wait.
- Listen.
- You know, I meant what I said earlier about being around people who really care about you and who you really care about.
- It doesn't happen often for people like us.
- No. It doesn't.
- What if we're lucky enough to find that person?
- We're supposed to just walk away?
- Doesn't seem fair, does it?
- No.
- Because it isn't.
- Is the cast absolutely necessary?
- Yes.
- It could be a hairline fracture.
- Better safe than sorry.
- I'm going to go find you some crutches.
- No, absolutely not.
- I want to be released immediately.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- This is a g\*n wound.
- We have to report this.
- This is outrageous.
- I don't care about your rules.
- I don't care about what you have to do.
- I'm leaving now.
- Sir, I highly suggest you stay overnight in case your leg gets infected.
- I can't do that.
- I have to go.
- Yeah.
- Casey, it's Chuck. Look, I found Busgang.
- He's here at the hospital. Westside Medical.
- You found him. Great work. All right.
- We'll have a strike team there in a half an hour. No, no, no. He's leaving.
- Don't follow him, Chuck. It's too dangerous.
- He might know how to get the Intersect out of my head. I can't let him go.
- Listen to me. Do not go after him on your own.
- Do not be a hero here, Chuck.
- Look, I don't want to be a hero, but sometimes, you need to be.
- Besides, this is doable.
- I've got them both.
- Hi. Hi.
- I'm looking for Mr. Busgang.
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.
- Yeah, well.
- Uh, the thing is, see, I'm a computer tech.
- Um, Nerd Herd.
- That's me.
- And apparently, Mr. Busgang has some major hardware problems.
- Constellation Science, second floor.
- Thank you.
- Can I help you gentlemen?
- Turn around.
- Slowly.
- You're the guy who sh\*t me.
- It was an accident, I swear. It was the first time I had ever handled a g\*n and the first time that I had sh\*t someone.
- Clearly those two things must be connected in some way.
- Hi. I'm Chuck.
- Sit down and don't move.
- I need to accidentally sh\*\*t you.
- I didn't come to hurt you or even take you in.
- I just want some answers about the Intersect.
- What do you know about the Intersect?
- A lot, actually.
- Who are you?
- Orion.
- Did you just flash?
- Cover the stairs.
- You're the one they've been talking about, aren't you?
- I didn't believe it could be true.
- A human Intersect.
- Extraordinary.
- Maybe for you.
- But you have to understand, for me...
- For me, it's a nightmare.
- Living with this thing in my head is ruining my life.
- Is there any way th-that Intersect images can be taken out?
- You know, can a person be "de-Intersected"?
- Can it be removed?
- Possibly.
- I don't know.
- Only Orion would know.
- Orion? Who is Orion?
- It was his idea, his vision.
- Everything is based on his work.
- He put the team together, he drove the research, until he realized--
- Put the g\*n down, Howard.
- Who's Orion? Where can I find him?
- Please! I need to know!
- Split up!
- I haven't told him anything.
- No! No!
- That's the second time you've sh\*t me.
- Let's hope the third time's the charm.
- Sweep the leg.
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm fine. The g\*n.
- What?
- Chuck, the g\*n!
- Oh, help!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so!
- I think so.
- Oh, you were, you were talking to him.
- I thought you were asking if I was okay but you're talking to him Because he's been sh\*t again, right.
- My bad.
- No, I was talking to both of you.
- We're okay, right? We're okay.
- Yeah... right.
- Absolutely, we're okay.
- Excellent work, team.
- While we would have preferred to take Busgang alive, by capturing his work we've significantly set back Fulcrum's ability to build their own Intersect.
- Uh, what about that name? Orion?
- Busgang said that Orion could maybe get the Intersect out of my head.
- As of now, we have no leads, but our best people are on it.
- Agent Barker, medical transport for you back to the U. K. has been arranged.
- Thank you, General.
- So, it seems my work here is done... again.
- Agent Casey, it's been a real pleasure working with you.
- Yeah, likewise.
- Can I ask you something?
- When you escaped from Fulcrum, you really take out nine guys?
- The truth?
- Professional courtesy.
- It was more like 12.
- I just don't like to boast.
- Hey, so, what's next?
- Wing back to London and jam with The Stones?
- I have to say, Chuck, you are truly the most special agent I've ever worked with.
- Special.
- Good luck with getting that thing out of your head.
- Thanks, but, uh, I'm beginning to think that's never going to happen.
- You know what?
- I got a not-so-secret secret for you.
- You want something bad enough, don't ever take no for an answer.
- And... for God sakes, man, carry a g\*n.
- Maybe two.
- Wow.
- Nice cast.
- Ellie go to work on you?
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'm just happy it's not full body.
- Morgan, we gotta talk about the whole moving-in thing.
- I know we do.
- Chuck, I just don't know how to say this. I...
- You should have a seat.
- Okay.
- Sometimes things happen between, uh, two people who care about each other very much.
- Um, and it doesn't mean that they don't belong together.
- Belong together?
- What are you talking about?
- Uh, no, no, no.
- I can't move in with you, Chuck, because I'm going to move in with Anna.
- She loves me and she wants to move in with me.
- And I want to make her happy.
- But I want you to understand.
- I do, buddy.
- Seriously, I totally understand and furthermore, I think that you are absolutely making the right decision.
- Whew, that's awesome. Thank you.
- She gonna be okay with your string cheese habit?
- I know she will be, bro.
- Hey, and, uh, you and I, you know, we'll still be... friends?
- As opposed to what?
- That's an excellent point.
- Okay.
- Dr. Walker, my superiors agree that I need 24-hour round- the-clock medical assistance.
- Our jet awaits.
- I'm sorry, I have yogurt to serve.
- You'll have to find somebody else to take care of you.
- Now, now, you see, that's not going to work because no one else is gonna make me feel like you do.
- Believe me, I've looked.
- I'm serious.
- Don't pack your bags, don't say good-byes, just close your eyes and say yes.
- Come with me, Sarah.
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter?
- I thought you were a girl who liked adventure.
- I guess I'm not the kind of girl who cheats on her cover boyfriend.
- Is that all he is? A cover?
- What do you mean?
- I saw the way you looked at him when his life was in danger.
- I've been doing this a long time, Agent Walker.
- Well, who'd have thought it.
- Cole Barker loses the girl to Chuck Bartowski.
- When you meet somebody you care about, it's just hard to walk away.
- I couldn't have said it better myself.
- ♪ ♪
- How's your foot?
- Uh, throbbing.
- Thanks.
- Did Cole leave?
- Uh, mm-hmm.
- He's quite a guy.
- Uh, yeah.
- That he is.
- You know, I understand what you see in him.
- He's a great spy.
- Top of good guys.
- The truth is, you two would make a great team.
- Chuck...
- Please, let me just finish.
- Sarah, I'm not gonna move in with you.
- Because I can't.
- And you know why I can't.
- I'm crazy about you, and I've always been.
- But you know, having a fake relationship, that's one thing.
- But living together is...
- I mean, every day being around each other and-and...
- And that's why I can't do it.
- And I hope you understand.
- I do.
- Thank you.
- Oh, and, uh, just so you know, I am going to get this thing out of my head one day.
- I will.
- And when I do, I'm going to live the life that I want with the girl that I love.
- Because I'm not going to let this thing rob me of that.
- I won't.
- Hey, how's the ankle?
- I picked up some boxes in case you wanted to start packing up your room.
- Change of plans, not moving out, talk later.
