# Chuck Versus the Helicopter

- Hi. My name's Charles Bartowski, but you can call me Chuck.
- Those are my shoes. This is my life. It's filled with spies, car chases, computer-stealing ninjas and me saving the day.
- Oh, wait, wait. I need to go back.
- I work at the Buy More.
- It used to be pretty boring.
- Chuck! Get over here! Now!
- Look at this. What happened?
- Well, way to go, Jeff.
- You do realize we don't work for Large Mart.
- They're our competition.
- Can you imagine the shame if some Large Mart fiend or Costco stooge put out a display on our Buy More green?
- So this has to come down, right?
- Yesterday.
- I now present to you the magic... of Morgan. This is my best friend, Morgan. He is not a magician.
- Voila!
- See, everything changed when I got an e-mail from my old college buddy Bryce Larkin.
- You see, Bryce had been working for the CIA when he stole a whole bunch of government secrets-- big important secrets, really scary, nasty, k*ll secrets.
- Next thing I know, these secrets are downloaded into my brain, which means every moment of my life... is in danger.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- The NSA sent their top agent to protect me.
- That's Casey. He's pretty scary.
- He works at Buy More now, as a cover.
- So now I must defend the country from assassins... no, Casey!
- ... t*rrorists... ... and shoplifters.
- Casey, Casey, Casey. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. It's just a video game, okay?
- Lives are not in danger, and the country is still safe.
- This guy's been here 24 hours and he's taking the job way more seriously than me.
- That's because he's crazy.
- Tell me something I don't know.
- Oh, hey, dawg. Nice to see you again, pal. Huh?
- You're not so tough now, are you?
- Oh, you don't like that, huh?
- Sarah?
- The CIA sent their top agent too.
- Oh, yeah, I know. Believe me.
- She told me to trust her.
- But just like any woman, she's got a past. and... she's posing as my girlfriend.
- Sarah, what, uh... what are you doing here?
- I work here now, Chuck.
- Oh, damn.
- I b*rned another batch.
- Why are you working here?
- Surveillance.
- I can monitor the Buy More from here while you work.
- It's just a cover.
- Right, yllh, a part of the plan. 'Cause there's a plan, right?
- I mean, uh, you making Gourmet Wieners isn't exactly the reason why you joined the CIA, and Casey isn't a natural-born appliance salesman, and the whole kinda government-secrets-locked-in-my-brain thing, uh, that's, I'm sure, not really a boon for national security, so I'm hoping, I mean, I'm hoping that you'll tell me that there's a plan?
- We have a plan.
- There is somebody who can help.
- We can discuss it further tonight.
- How about another date? I can pick you up at 8:00.
- Yeah. Yeah, that sounds... I'd like that. That sounds great. I'll, uh, I'll see you.
- Chuck is in.
- Send the doctor.
***
- Hey, sis, what do you think of this shirt?
- Another date with Sarah. This is very exciting.
- Well, see, it's not that big a deal.
- Yes, it is. Hey, she is hot.
- Jeepers.
- I'd go with the first shirt, too. It looks really nice with your skin tone.
- Oh, yeah?
- Wait a minute-- Morgan has met her, and I haven't?
- Well... yeah, he confides in me, Ellie. You know?
- He-he tells me his deepest, darkest secrets, which, you could, too, by the way.
- Here's one: I loath you.
- That's not a secret.
- I need to meet this girl. Tomorrow night. Dinner. Here.
- A little too soon to be seeing the tron poster, don't you think?
- Not exactly a natural aphrodisiac.
- Dinner. Perfect. I'll clear my schedule.
***
- Our most valuable secrets have been sent to an idiot.
- Well, at least they weren't sent to his friend.
- "Operation Chuck." I can't believe this.
- I spoke with agent Walker.
- She'll deliver Chuck to the rendezvous tonight.
- Good. Dr. Zarnow's on his way to L.A. Now.
- He is our best, NSA's top scientist.
- Well, I hope he can fix this.
***
- Get in.
- Wienerlicious really pays well, huh?
- Uh, what are we, uh, what are we doing? We're going to, uh, like, a movie or some dinner?
- Not exactly.
- What, what does, what does "not exactly" mean, exactly?
- So.
- Here we are on our date at the Buy More.
- Is this all part of the plan or a chance for me to clock in some overtime?
- There's a doctor coming to see you, Chuck.
- He worked on the encoding process for the intersect, the computer that Bryce destroyed, the one that's in your head.
- He's coming to examine you.
- Uh-huh, uh, and-and does this examination involve, say, I don't know, needles or perhaps probing of some kind?
- The doctor is our best sh*t at helping you.
- It's what you want, right?
- To get the secrets out of your head.
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.
- But you-you still... you're still being very vague about the probing, and I'd like to know the answer to that.
- We've rewired the home theater room for this test.
- When the images start, just say what they are.
- That's it?
- I'm sure you'll finda way to screw it up.
- The doctor's here.
- When do I get to meet him?
- You don't.
- It's important that he doesn't see you. You're too valuable.
- Thanks. I'm flattered and totally freaked out.
***
- Dr. Zarnow?
- Agent Casey.
- Agent Walker.
- Thank you for meeting us at a neutral site.
- Let's begin.
- I don't understand why I can't see my patient.
- For your safety, we're keeping patient X's identity a secret.
- Does patient X work here?
- Patient X--who knows all the intersect secrets--works in a Buy More?
- Ridiculous. Of course.
- After the tone, the test will begin. uh... dog.
- Uh, hippopotamus.
- Fat guy.
- Ugly building.
- Really beautiful woman at the beach.
- Cardinal one is the top Moscow spy in the White House office of... the plot to assassinate president Carter was orchestrated by... northrop Davis voting computers has been approved by the DNC, RNC and CIA.
- Oceanic flight 815 was sh*t down by surface-to-air... work on subterranean... beneath denver international airport has reached phase four.
- Benedictine agents within the Vatican report... assassin still active... been approved by the DNC, RNC and CIA. Scenario five is...
- Okay, well, that's just a picture of a turtle.
- Your patient is phenomenal.
- We never imagined this.
- What didn't you imagine?
- One person seeing all the intersect images.
- All our secrets in one mind.
- Can you remove the secrets, doctor?
- Yes. I think I can.
***
- So, did I pass the test?
- You did great, Chuck.
- And this doctor guy--he can fix me or... ?
- Uh, he's hopeful, yeah.
- Okay.
- Oh, uh, I almost forgot.
- Uh... dinner tomorrow night with my sister and her boyfriend captain awesome.
- She really wanted to meet you.
- Okay, well, that's a good idea.
- Meeting the family's kind of a big step if our relationship were remotely real. so, uh, if this whole examination thing, if it works out, then I guess... we're through, huh?
- Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Okay. Well, good night.
- Good night.
- Oh, and, uh... just so you know... um... tonight was probably the best... only second date I've been on in years.
- Drive safe.
***
- Did you see this?
- At wh?
- Did you know that Bryce was dead?
- No. No, I didn't.
- Well, are you okay?
- I don't know.
- Um... yeah, I don't know. It's crazy.
- I, uh, I spent so much time hating him for getting me kicked out of Stanford, I don't know, really, how to feel, but it's hard to be mad at him now.
- I'm really sorry, Chuck.
***
- Yeah, ey's cas. I'm at the scene.
- No sign of Zarnow's body. Probably vaporized.
- I guess those secrets are staying in Chuck's head.
- Well... no sign of anything here.
- It looks like we're sending the good doctor home in an ashtray.
- Okay, well, I've got hot dogs to fry.
- And I've got some toasters to sell.
- Feels like a CIA job to me.
- Keep your eye on agent Walker.
- And don't let Chuck out of your sight. He could be next.
***
- The strong bars are getting a little sticky. On... on one.
- On the other one, it's fine, but on the second... you can't trust her.
***
- Chuck. John.
- Big mike. Big mike!
- How's customer service training?
- Fine.
- Super.
- Glad to hear it.
- The better my employees, the less I have to work.
- Very inspiring words, sir.
- Regular call to arms.
- Well, go make 'em better.
- Show me you're assistant manager material.
- Chop-chop! I got a napin an hour.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
***
- So, uh, this is the hand-held scanner.
- Very expensive piece of equipment.
- So is a stealth fighter and somehow I managed to fly that.
- Right, uh, and the g*n, you know, kind of works like A... g*n?
- Uh-huh.
- And it beeps when you scan the barcodes. well, if screamed out loud, I'd be right at home.
- N't I do want you to have any more private meetings with Sarah, hmm?
- Um, is there... is there a problem?
- No problems, only solutions.
- Well, that... sounds very much like the Buy More customer policy that I've noticed you have some issue with.
- A now you kn, uh... you know what I think we're gonna do about that?
- We're gonna do some role-playing, and work on that attitude of yours how about that?
- Hey, Morgan.
- Hi, yo.
- Ah, hey, there he is. There's my johnny-on-the-spot.
- Morgan and Casey, you guys are gonna do some stuff.
- You're gonna be a shopper, and you're gonna be the sales rep, like you are.
- And, uh, I'm gonna talk to Big Mike and-and work on some stuff 'cause I know he's got other things in store.
- Got it from here. There you go.
***
- So, Chuck, no private meetings with Casey today.
- What? What is it up with you guys?
- Did he tell you the same thing?
- Right, of course he did.
- Hold on a second. Is something wrong?
- The doctor from last night-- he was k*ll in an expl*si*n soon after he left us.
- Wha-what?
- The doctor who was supposed to fix me?
- Tell me what this is.
- A... a nasty...
- NSA incinerator.
- Special issue designed to eliminate all biological traces.
- That's what k*ll the doctor.
- And guess who works for the NSA?
- Why... why, why would Casey...
- He's a k*ll, Chuck.
- It's what he does for a living.
- He tried to k*ll us, and he'll probably try to do it again.
- Maybe it was orders.
- Maybe he didn't like the way Zarnow looked at him.
- Oh, that's nice. I feel much better now, Sarah.
- What am I supposed to do?
- You go back in there and you pretend like you know nothing.
- Go. You can do that, Chuck.
- I know nothing.
- I know nothing, I... got it.
***
- All right, so I'm gonna try again. Ready?
- Do you have any Ramones?
- No, don't say no. It's not gonna... listen, okay.
- Uh, excuse me, John. How you doing? Do you have any Ramones here, dude?
- Don't tell me you don't have any.
- Casey, the... the correct response is "can we order you the Ramones?"
- Ramones, man, Ramones. Okay, just looking for the Ramones, man.
- Do you have Ramones? 'Cause I love Ramones... ow!
- That's a "no" on the Ramones, I guess.
- Okay, I don't think that's in the Buy More manual.
- What did Sarah tell you?
- I know you talked to her. It's what I do for a living.
- Oh, no, here it is, on the bottom shelf: Ramones.
***
- There you go.
- Thanks.
- Bye.
- I love you.
- What did you tell Chuck?
- That you're a cold-blooded k*ll. Was I lying?
- No.
***
- The way I figure it, the only two people that knew the doctor was coming are right here.
- Since I didn't cap him, you're under arrest. quick, take a pic.
- She's so hot. Did you get it? Come on.
- Let's go put it on the internet.
- Mr. Bartowski.
***
- Hi Lester.
- Uh, code zebra.
- Linux install at a factory off ventura. 142 Euclid.
- Uh... I'm sorry. Why-why can't you and Jeff go?
- linux, PCs? We're, uh, we're MAC guys, Chuck. We're... we're IT artists.
- Okay. Yeah. Uh... fine, whatever.
- I'll be back in half an hour.
- And, uh, just tell Casey that I'm on my cell.
- You tell him. I'm not your servant.
- Okay, you know what... no, no, I mean, I'm gonna tell him.
***
- I just, you know, I mean, in general, I don't always... absolutely, I'm going to... right now, should I tell him? hello?
- Pull over.
- Well, I can't pull over.
- I have a home install at, uh...
- 142 Euclid?
- Guess who called that in?
- Oh, my god. It was you!
- You k*ll the doctor, and now you're here to k*ll me! Are you out of your mind?
- What... what... what... what happened to you?
- Your girlfriend happened.
- What, who, Sarah?
- She's rogue, Chuck.
- She k*ll the doctor, then she tried to k*ll me.
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, I'm golden. Thanks for asking.
- No, no, no, why should I believe you?
- She showed me the b*mb. She said you did it.
- NSA incinerator, right?
- It's a nice expl*sive easily purchased on the black market.
- What do you really know about Sarah, Chuck, huh?
- Think.
- She's CIA.
- She worked with Bryce.
- He was rogue. Maybe she is, too.
- She found you in L.A., But she couldn't grab you because I was around.
- So she had to wait her chance.
- Dr. Zarnow screwed that up.
- He could pull those secrets out of your head, then she loses the intersect, so she had to act fast. let's go. Come on.
- Thought I turned that off.
- Well, it's not me. Is it yours? no.
- NSA incinerator! Run!
- Casey! Casey!
***
- You're nervous cooking, babe. Relax.
- Devon, this dinner has to go well.
- It's going to be awesome. You don't know Chuck.
- He freaks out when he likes a girl.
- Yeah, ain't that the truth, huh?
- You know practice makes perfect.
- How did you get in here?
- Uh, Chuck's window.
- Or, as I like to call it, the Morgan door.
- I got to lock the window. I wonder where Chuck is.
***
- Still think it was me?
- Why would Sarah do this?
- She's cleaning the operation.
- Cleaning?
- Eliminating everyone she's come in contact with.
- You know where she is?
- We have to get back to my house. She's having dinner with us tonight.
- No, kid, you're on the next plane to Washington.
- But my sister... doesn't have a super computer in her noggin.
- You're the priority.
- It's Casey. Put me through to general... hey!
- Hey!
***
- Chuck! well, it's about time.
- Chuck.
- Where have you been?
- Why?
- You, uh, you surprised to see me?
- What?
- Where's Casey?
- I don't know.
- Maybe he's having some car trouble.
- Everyone okay?
- Yeah, just a little hungry, dude. You're late.
- And dirty for my taste.
- And your girlfriend has been just nothing but mean to me.
- Look out for her.
- So I'm glad everyone's getting along so well.
- Yeah, your sister is awesome.
- Indeed.
- Hey! I've got an idea.
- Why don't we actually go out, huh, for pizza or something, some place public, with lots and lots of people around?
- Uh, Chuck, I've been cooking all day.
- Yeah, cooking pot roast, dude, which is my favorite.
- Manzoom, manjo. Let's eat.
- Sit down, okay? It'll be good.
- Lady. Looks great, baby.
- This looks delicious, Ellie.
- Oh, it was nothing.
- So, Sarah, let's turn this up a notch personal style.
- Tell us something about yourself.
- Well, I'm originally from D.C. I just moved here.
- Oh, Chuck had a friend from D.C.
- A former friend.
- You know, former because a: He was a jerk, and b: He's... well, he's dead.
- The girl Chuck was dating before you-- he stole her.
- Ugh, I just don't know how anyone could choose Bryce over Chuck.
- Hi. I'm John Casey. I just moved in upstairs. I thought I might bring something over.
- Ow, come in.
- Chuck, you didn't tell me you're bringing another friend.
- Hey. Hi. Yeah.
- It totally slipped my mind that my friend, John Casey, was coming over, and we work at Buy More together.
- Morgan, you know John from Buy More.
- I was telling him we were gonna have a get-together and that, you know, the more, the merrier.
- You pull a stunt like that again, I'll k*ll you before she can.
- You kidder.
- Chuck, we're going to need another chair.
- Okeydokey.
***
- You know what? I'm crashing the party. Maybe I should... I'll get it.
- Strange.
- NSA ran a check on Sarah Walker to see what we had... two years ago, she posed as a French diplomat.
- Infiltrated the inner circle of an arms deal.
- k*ll the entire circle.
- With a b*mb?
- We don't know.
- Her alias was Elana Truffaut.
- Eyth were poisoned.
- At dinner.
- Wonderful. hey, sis... chair. Ta-da!
- So... thank you.
- Chuck.
- I mean, I knew that you had it in you, but she is... oh, she is... wow, she's really great.
- Yeah. She's... unpredictable.
- Hey, listen to me.
- You have no reason to be nervous. Okay?
- Now, you have a great girl out there. I mean, she even made dessert.
- Dessert?
- Yeah.
- Oh, dessert. Dessert. Poison.
- Don't freak out.
- Stop!
***
- We... uh, we didn't do a toast... yet.
- Which I... which I'll do right now.
- Uh... so, I'd like to propose a toast. To my sister.
- To my sister, and-and to... to a meal that looks so great.
- And Devon, you're great.
- And Sarah. And Sarah for a great dessert.
- And to John Casey and-and his... and his... and his mini quiches, which are equally as great.
- And what about me, Chuck?
- For what?
- And to Morgan for his great comic timing.
- Thank yo sir.
- Cheers.
- Well, you know, that soufflé does look amazing.
- You're right, honey. I can't even resist.
- Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait.
- Who likes magic?
- I do!
- I know a trick.
- Chuck... oh, Chuck, what are you doing?
- Voila!
- whoa, Chuck, that was... I knew you could do it, man.
- Flamb?
***
- Chuck!
- Chuck, look, no matter how stressed out you are, it is never okay to m*rder a woman's soufflé?
- Um, you know what? Let me talk to him.
- Casey, hey, maybe, uh... tell me exactly ey cas said.
- Nothing. Everything's okay.
- Makeup sex. Nice.
- What did he tell you?
- That you k*ll Dr. Zarnow and poisoned a bunch of French diplomats.
- They're blaming me for Zarnow?
- If you're planning on hurting me, even to prove a point, I think you should know I have a very low threshold for pain.
- And you believe Casey?
- Tell me about the French diplomats.
- They were French assassins, and they were after me, but I got to them first.
- And you know what? I'm kinda glad that I did.
- Chuck, do you really think that my name is Sarah?
- I never asked you to believe me. I asked you to trust me.
- This doesn't make sense.
- If Casey didn't k*ll Zarnow, then...
- What are you doing?
- I have to go right now.
***
- Uh, I'm sorry.
- I have to go, but dinner was wonderful.
- Gotta go. Be back.
- Yeah, well, I better be going, too.
- This has been great. Thanks.
- Uh... you're welcome.
- I think that went well.
- You know, not great, but I think it went well.
- So, uh, I'm gonna make a little doggy bag and head out my Morgan door.
- How about that?
- Sounds good? Super-duper.
***
- Sarah, wait!
- You stay inside.
- Do what I say.
- Do you think we were wrong?
- Casey! hey, don't move.
- Zarnow?
- Good to see you again, agent Casey.
- Oh, my god.
- Yep, we were wrong.
- Casey, he's got Sarah. We've got to save her.
***
- Brilliant deduction, nancy drew.
- Now pull out the tranq dart!
- Oh, I have a very strong aversion to needles.
- Do it!
- Okay, uh, here we go.
- That was the doctor, right? He's probably not dead?
- And the sun sets in the west.
- Nothing gets by you.
- One, two, three. what's he gonna do with Sarah?
- He's gonna torture her until she tells him all about you.
- Come on.
- If we hurry, we can catch him.
- All right, where are we going?
- I laced my quiches with microbots.
- You're not kidding, are you?
- I don't kid about quiche.
- We can trace him using the car's tracker.
- Yeah, I think that only comes with the sports package.
- We made some enhancements when your car was in the shop.
- Got a signal.
- Let's go.
***
- Hey, Casey, Casey.
- Wait a minute.
- Why, why would he bring Sarah here?
- I don't know.
- You wait here. damn tranq dart. come on.
- Oh, god. hey, wait, you idiot!
- It's Morgan.
- He ate your quiches.
- We're on the wrong trail.
- Come on.
- I got nothing.
- What do you mean you got nothing?
- Then what do we do?
- It's over. She's gone.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Okay, this is our fault.
- We didn't believe her.
- Now we have to save her.
- Look, if you were a bad guy, what would you do, fly Sarah out on a plane?
- Would you use a boat or a-a-a what?
- Chopper.
- Small airfield near the water.
- The closest I could find.
- Then do-do a satellite search using the touch screen and then maybe limit that to airfields that are within a certain range of us and then maybe limit that by if there's activity on the ground?
- That's not bad.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, I was just kind of, you know, spit balling, just kind of top of my head.
- I was thinking... found it.
- Port of Los Angeles.
- Floor it.
- Okay.
***
- This is how this is gonna work.
- I'm gonna go over there, rescue Sarah, and capture Dr. Zarnow, sh**t anybody who gets in my way.
- You, you're gonna stay here.
- So, in this plan I basically do nothing?
- Yep.
- Let's do this.
- All right, all right.
- Now we wait.
- Stay in the car.
- Stay in the car.
- Do not leave the car.
- Do not leave this car.
***
- Sarah, are you okay?
- What are you doing here?
- Stupid question.
- Okay, uh, should I... ?
- Sorry.
- Chuck, you have to get out of here.
- No, I'm here to save you.
- You shouldn't even be here; you're too valuable, and, besides, I have this well in hand.
- Uh-huh, yeah, 'cause it looks well in hand.
- Just find me something to pick this lock.
- I don't... okay, here.
- Go, go, go!
- The tape, the tape.
- The helicopter's ready, agent Walker.
- This is your last chance.
- We're going to a special facility where they're going to torture you.
- Really torture, not this child's play.
- Or you could just tell me who is patient X.
- Something for the flight.
- Oh, crap.
- Run!
- Oh, crap.
- I know you. I know your secret.
- You-you've been feeding American science to North Korea for years.
- Ah, patient X.
- To think that my secrets are in that head of yours.
- It's an honor, really.
- Of course, to hell with honor.
- I'm here for the impressive dollar figure the human intersect will fetch.
- Who will I offer you to first?
- Sarah... Sarah... don't worry, agent Walker.
- I'll take good care of him.
- No, Casey, don't sh**t. They have Chuck.
- Proceed to bravo coordinates.
- The ship will be waiting there.
- It's about ten miles offshore.
- 15-minute flight.
- Don't move!
- You must be kidding.
- I want you to land the helicopter right now.
- It's heavier than you thought.
- What?
- The g*n.
- It's heavy.
- Don't... don't!
- Give me back the g*n.
- I'm not giving you the g*n! you sh*t the pilot, you idiot!
- I didn't mean to do that.
- What's happening?
- Who's flying this thing?
- You're going to k*ll us both.
- Come on, Chuck. let me go. get your hands off of me!
- Get off of me! oh, god.
- That's a crane.
- Oh, my god, Casey, I think Chuck's flying the chopper.
***
- Yeah, I'm here.
- I told you to stay in the car.
- You know what? Forget about the car.
- Tell me how to fly a helicopter.
- All right, there's a collective in the cyclic control.
- What?
- One's the stick. One looks like an emergency brake.
- Grab 'em both.
- Okay, okay, I got it.
- This is not working!
- Push the stick just a bit forward while doing the same thing with the emergency brake.
- Ground-- not good.
- Pull up! Pull up!
- Pull up on the emergency brake!
- Level off. Level off!
- I don't know how. I don't know how to level off!
- Listen, moron, you want to die?
- Casey, put Sarah on the phone.
- Give me the phone, Casey.
- Here.
- Okay... uh, Chuck, you're going to be okay.
- Now, I need you to focus.
- Uh, have you ever played any flying games before?
- Flight simulators? Yeah.
- Flight simulators? Yeah, sure, I've done those, yeah.
- Okay, which ones?
- Uh, maverick of the skies... uh, stealth fighter elite... uh, apache chopper patrol.
- Great.
- Okay, now remember that last one.
- I want you to pretend like you're playing that game, okay.
- You're just in your bedroom, you're playing a game, and none of this is real.
- It's just a game.
- It's just a game.
- Okay, I can do this.
- I can play this game.
- Easy, Chuck, easy.
- Uh... uh, is this one of those helicopters that can turn into a boat?
- No, it isn't.
- Just ease to the right and goose the brake.
- They designed the game exactly like the helicopter.
***
- I got it.
- I got it.
- Almost there.
- A little more to the right.
- Keeping right. Keeping right.
- Goosin' the brake.
- It's just a game.
- A big scary video game. oh, thank you, god! oh, yes!
- You are wonderful.
- And that is how... I do... that!
- That's how we do that.
- Go, team. Sarah... see Sarah.
- Up top on that one.
- Palms are a little sweaty, but... what the hell were you thinking?
- Clammy hands, got it, no good.
- Chuck, the secrets that you know are incredibly important.
- You compromised everything when you stopped trusting me.
- And when you got out of the car.
- Listen, I'm... I'm sorry, okay?
- No, it is not okay.
- How could you think I was the double, huh?
- You know, I am not Bryce.
- Bryce betrayed everything that I believe in, and if you ever accuse me of that again, then I will walk away.
- Mission over. We all go back to Washington.
- And you do not want that to happen, Chuck.
- That you should trust me on.
***
- Way to go, ace.
- Dad's suit?
- Yeah.
- It's my only one.
- I'm quite certain he wouldn't mind, though.
- You realize that you don't have to go to Bryce's funeral.
- Yeah, yeah, I guess.
- It's just we had a lot of history.
- Even if he did get me kicked out of school and steal my girlfriend.
- Well... you've moved on to bigger and better girls.
- I don't really mean bigger like, literally bigger.
- I just mean that, um... that I really like Sarah.
- And I hope you guys work things out before the next dinner party, of course.
- I don't know... I don't know, sis.
- I... I... look, I really think I blew it.
- Chuck, just try apologizing.
- It goes a long way.
- Sarah's special.
- She's different from your Stanford friends.
***
- He flew a helicopter?
- Your report was rather terrifying, major Casey.
- Do we really have the situation in hand, or should Mr. Bartowskibe in our care full-time?
- Well, you know how I feel, general.
- But for now, we're in control.
- Then Chuck stays where he is.
- But, uh, don't get too comfortable, Casey.
- The new intersect will be up and running in six months.
- And what happens to Chuck when this is done?
- Well, you'll do what you do best.
***
- knock, knock.
- Hey, Chuck.
- How is everything?
- I saw you at the funeral.
- Oh, yeah, I had to go.
- After everything Bryce did, he was still my partner.
- Look, I'm not accusing you of anything... today.
- Yesterday, yes, I may have laid it on a little thick with the accusing.
- But I'm really sorry about that.
- Instead of not trusting you, I should have been thanking you for saving my life and protecting the country and-and-and... and making really tasty Gourmet Wieners.
- I'm sorry I yelled at you.
- It was our first fight.
- You know, it's a big step, if our relationship were remotely real.
- You know, with Dr. Zarnow gone, Chuck, those intersect secrets aren't going anywhere.
- That means more missions, more danger, more secrets that you can't tell your sister or your friends.
- I know that.
- Some people want to be heroes and others have to be asked.
- So... Chuck, are you ready? good.
***
- I hope we're not interrupting anything.
- Uh... by the way, I thought we'd give that dinner another sh*t, maybe here.
- We knew you'd forgive him.
- Right, and you realize that you all have to eat my cooking.
- Give me the 411 on the corn dogs.
- What do you think, man?
- What do you recommend, buddy?
- Sarah?
- Holy... okay.
- Cheers.
