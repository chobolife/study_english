# Chuck Versus the Zoom

- Hi I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know.
- You really think you've been fighting evil...
- ... doing good?
- You think it was all a coincidence?
- The Intersect, FULCRUM, the Ring, Shaw, Agent X?
- You're just a pawn, you always were.
- No, no, n-n-n-no, don't take the Intersect.
- You're fired, Chuck.
- No!
- Operation Bartowski is done.
- What if we went into business for ourselves?
- Sarah: Hartley turned over all of Volkoff's assets to us.
- Our first purchase was the Buy More and everything below it.
- Freelance spies.
- Under the radar, above the law.
- Oh, man, this is gonna be so much fun.
- Nice.
- Guys... I know kung fu.
- So... ocean view, gulls flying by?
- Think this is something you could get used to?
- Well, I-I think I'm more of a toes-in-the-sand kind of girl.
- I like the idea of waking up in the morning and rolling out onto the beach.
- Okay, well, then maybe we can find a nice little place on the sand someday if we, you know...
- Survive this?
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- How you doing today?
- No sh**ting.
- I don't want the bl*od and the mess on the pool deck.
- Make them jump.
- Think we can survive this?
- I don't think so, honey.
- Honey?
- You talk like an old married couple.
- Well, actually...
- No, no, I'm sorry, I don't care.
- We just came for the vase.
- It belongs to our client.
- You let us have it and maybe we'll let you live.
- Sarah: You've fallen into our trap.
- You see, we work with a master spy, somebody who you can't see coming.
- In fact, right now, he's probably...
- (g*n cocks)
- I want it noted that I took out six of their guys.
- Henchman: He was taking this.
- You thieves have expensive tastes.
- This vase is worth $6 million.
- It's times like these, I wish I still had the Intersect.
- Well, you don't.
- What now, Moriarty?
- k*ll them.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait wait!
- We have another master spy.
- (groans)
- (beeps)
- (beeping)
- Okay, yes, yes, first mission as the Intersect.
- You can do this.
- They need you, Morgan, so get in there, okay, and you be a man.
- No, be more than a man.
- Start with the man part, just be a man first.
- ♪ ♪
- Keep going, thief, this is fun.
- Well, the fun's about to end, Jean Claude, because while we've been standing around chatting, our other master spy has been effortlessly breaching your compound's security.
- ♪ ♪
- (thud)
- I'm good, I'm good.
- He's heartless, cruel...
- I'm so sorry, fishies, about your pond.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Sarah: You think your security men are the best, top-notch?
- I admit I do.
- Sarah: Well, our spy is currently slicing through them like a hot kn*fe through butter.
- Go on, say something about you-know-who.
- Do I have to?
- Yes.
- He'll tear your limbs off and b*at you with them.
- Okay, okay.
- Points for trying, but where is this master spy?
- Morgan: You looking for me?
- Right here, tough guy.
- (laughing)
- Okay, here we go.
- Here we go.
- k*ll him, too. k*ll them all.
- Come on. Now's the time, buddy.

- Chuck: All righty, folks, it wasn't a total catastrophe.
- The client was not interested in the vase but the microchip inside it, and that is intact.
- Boom.
- Señor.
- Bang, we are in the pink.
- The vase was going to be our payment.
- And... still is, fully restored.
- Who's not going to pay six mil for a slightly used Ming vase?
- Chuck, we mowed through the Volkoff fortune on start-up costs. I mean, look at these numbers.
- $42 million, which is still a lot of dough.
- Rockets, b*ll*ts, the private jet, servicing the private jet, the fresh shrimp that Morgan likes to eat on the private jet.
- You have to understand they're just not the same frozen.
- They're expensive, and if we're going to stay solvent, then we need to collect soon.
- Or crawl back to Beckman, get a government contract.
- Never had a problem with Uncle Sam.
- b*at the yahoos we got coming in here.
- Casey, our problem is not with Uncle Sam, it's with Clyde Decker, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.
- Beg, plead.
- You know I get antsy taking cases with moral ambiguity.
- Guys, come on.
- Sarah, isn't this what we wanted?
- Come on, Carmichael Industries-- the independence and freedom to do what we want when we want, and we're doing good, we're doing good.
- We got a solid team.
- We just need a little more time to get our feet on solid ground.
- And, in the meantime, we work for dirtbags.
- Chuck, you're handling this really well.
- I mean, all the bumps in the road and Morgan with the Intersect and you without it.
- Which is fine.
- Morgan, yes, has the Intersect now, but I'm, I'm happy for him.
- Plus, I get to work with my smokin' hot wife and my best friends.
- Who could ask for anything more?
- Okay.
- What was that?
- (mumbling): What was what?
- Are you hiding something?
- Why would I need to hide anything?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Morgan, Operation
- VFTB is dead.
- "View from the Bluff" is dead?
- (groans) Chuck, I found the perfect house for you guys.
- Well, except that I was wrong and Sarah doesn't want a house on the bluff.
- She wants her toes in the sand.
- Okay, fine, "Operation Toes in the Sand. "
- Actually, it makes a better acronym.
- Toes in the Sa-- T. I. T...
- Why don't, why don't, why don't we just call it "Operation Toes, " okay?
- Oh, fine, fine, I'll start my research.
- Oh, Chuck, I know you've been setting aside funds for this house, you know, and I hope my accident with the vase didn't, didn't blow it for you.
- No, hey, hey, don't worry about it.
- We've got a very promising potential client.
- We're going to wine and dine him and, soon enough, we will be raking it in.
- Good, and you know what?
- If it all goes south, well, we still have...
- The Buy More.
- She's served us well over the years.
- It all seems so normal, a little too normal.
- Yeah.
- Sleeping dogs, though; sleeping dogs.
- (phone rings)
- Oh, it's Casey.
- Wants us down in Castle.
- Yeah, all right.
- (quietly): Hoist the flag.
- Hey, Casey, what do you need?
- The client's here.
- I don't like him.
- What? The who, the what?
- The client-- the client is here?
- Hmm.
- I thought we were going to wine and dine the guy, charm him.
- Waste of time-- he's here now.
- Casey, this is supposed to be a secret base.
- I took precautions.
- Oh, good.
- Casey, what precautions?
- (panting)
- What the hell kind of operation is this?
- We're still working out the kinks.
- Man: $20 million was stolen from me by a high-level Ponzi schemer.
- You heard the name Roger Bale?
- Well, you will soon.
- He's bilked investors to the tune of about a half a billion dollars.
- Why not go to the cops?
- I did, but Bale has falsified records, saying he lost the money in normal trading and he's broke, but he keeps buying property in St. Martin.
- He's a thief.
- The heart of Bale's operation is a computer vault in his corporate headquarters.
- Access the accounts, get my money.
- Yes, we ride at midnight.
- His security is deadly.
- So maybe, maybe we, we ride first thing in the morning.
- No need to rush.
- That's probably a better idea.
- Twenty percent of what you recover is yours.
- Fifty.
- Done some digging on you, Woodley.
- You're just an ambulance chaser, trial lawyer, scum of the earth.
- Uh! He's kidding.
- He's kidding. He's only kidding.
- Casey, Bale is worth infiltrating anyway.
- Looks like he's stolen money from teachers' unions and families.
- Woodley: He stole $2 million from Rush Limbaugh.
- Tell me everything you know about this animal.
- Woodley: He's throwing himself a party tomorrow night-- his going-away-- but it's strictly invite, and everything goes through his secure Blackberry.
- What a complete tool.
- Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah on the Bluetooth, all day-- how rude.
- SARAH (over comm): I'm getting a really good feed from the satellite.
- The party's being set up, and the place looks like a fortress.
- Chuck: See? I told you satellite was a good investment.
- We just got to figure out a way to get into his PDA and invite ourselves to this party.
- Let's talk house, homeboy.
- What was that?
- Did you say house?
- Nothing, n-nothing, Sarah.
- Just hopping off real quick.
- (laughs softly)
- The house is secret, remember?
- The only secret, the only real secret is gonna be which room you're sleeping in.
- Why? 17 of 'em!
- Swimming pool, screening room, bowling alley, gourmet kitchen, second... bowling alley, and it's on the beach.
- (sighs) I mean, it's crazy, but...
- Hey, toes in the sand.
- Toes in the sand. Toes in...
- Toes in the sand!
- Could you imagine how awesome this would be, buddy?
- I mean, to give Sarah the dream life?
- Owning her own company, living in the dream home, a place that we can call our own.
- We just need this gig to pay out.
- (phone rings nearby) I know.
- One second.
- (clicking, beeping)
- Chuck, why don't we just nab this guy's phone while he's playing squash?
- Huh? I just zoomed on his gym bag.
- Okay? Kensington Athletic.
- It's, like a super exclusive squash club.
- He's got to have a regular game, right?
- Morgan, that's fantastic.
- Fantastic!
- Zoomed?
- Did you say you... what?
- Did you... you said you zoomed on his gym bag?
- Yes, yeah, because you had "flash, " which was great, but... mmm... I kind of want to do my own thing, mix it up a little bit, so I came up with zoom.
- You don't like it. Ah, you don't like it.
- No, hey, hey--
- "zoom" it is, buddy. You know.
- Whatever you want.
- Really? You're-you're amazing.
- You are so Zen right now. If I had a power like that and I thought it was gone forever, aw, Chuck, I'd be a wreck.
- Whew! But not you, man, you are my hero.
- You're great even without the Intersect.
- Chuck: How certain are you that these glasses only had one reload left in them?
- (sighs) Like... very certain.
- I tried to access the program, but there was no way to update it.
- This version of the Intersect is a one-time deal-- I'm sorry.
- That's okay. That's okay.
- Morgan's got it now, and he's doing surprisingly well, so...
- Chuck, what's wrong?
- (heavy sigh) The Intersect opened me up to big dreams.
- But in order for those dreams to become a reality, I need this business to succeed, and...
- You think the company doesn't work if you don't have the Intersect?
- Yeah.
- Chuck, I don't think that Dad wanted you to have the Intersect forever.
- And besides, you don't need it.
- The computer didn't make you a hero, it just gave you an opportunity to become one.
- Now it's up to you.
- The training wheels are off, you're gonna fall down, but I promise you... you can do this.
- My two cents.
- Thanks, sis.
- I needed a good Ellie speech.
- Well, what are sisters for?
- (laughs)
- The mission, is to access Roger Bale's PDA and put ourselves on the guest list for his party tonight.
- The phone is gonna be difficult to get to, and password-protected when we do.
- Bale has bodyguards; could be trouble.
- And that's why you're the one going for the phone, Casey.
- This plug-in will cut through all the encryption and install a virus that will send me an invite.
- Bale is playing in a club squash tournament. Morgan, you're gonna delay his opponent while I step in and match up with Bale.
- He'll get to know my face and name so that when I show up at the party, I won't be a complete stranger.
- What? What-what-what, what's the problem? What's up?
- You're gonna play? Do you actually play any non-video game sports?
- Yeah, I played some racquetball.
- I think I can fake squash for half an hour.
- No, Chuck, I don't think so.
- I... Sarah.
- Sarah: Uh... well, sweetheart, um... you know, I-I think what, um...
- Let's put Grimes on the court.
- He can zoom on squash, give the guy a game.
- "Zoom, " Casey?
- It'll buy me some time.
- Morgan: You delay his opponent, take over the job I was gonna do.
- It'll be great, right? What was the job I was gonna do?
- (moaning)
- Yeah...
- Oof...
- I think I'm supposed to be playing my game right now. You sure it's only 2:00?
- Oh, Mr. Burnham, you just sit here and relax.
- I will tell you when it's time.
- And right now, it is... not time.
- Bale's coming.
- (over comm): Casey, he's headed your way.
- Morgan, get ready, he'll be there in a minute.
- Yep.
- Chuck, you keep that bear on that table, or this all falls apart.
- Burnham: Remember, I like it deep... and hard.
- That's great.
- That just sounds great.
- Hey, man, sorry for the delay.
- I had a hot tub full of nursing students.
- Bale: They're so chatty.
- Morgan: Totally.
- Bale: So, you must be k*ll Burnham?
- He's a no-show.
- I'm Michael Carmichael of Michael Carmichael Industries, a subsidiary of MikeCo.
- That sounds like big money.
- Morgan: Mmm, you have no idea.
- You know, if was standing on my wallet...
- I'd be tall.
- Yeah. (laughs)
- Your skin is... soft to the touch.
- There you go.
- Is that a waxing situation?
- My wife's talked to me about waxing, but...
- I'm not really a big fan of physical contact.
- Outside of my job, of course.
- This is what I do every day.
- Hey, uh, your ball warm?
- Here we go.
- (grunts)
- Amigo, my ball is...
- (whispers): red-hot.
- You're pretty quick.
- "Sneaky quick, " they call that.
- Morgan: Ooh! Sneaky quick.
- Put a little elbow grease into it.
- (grunting): Oh, yeah? Should I do that?
- There you go. There it is.
- (whispers): Almost there.
- Almost there.
- Little deeper.

- So, let me ask you a question.
- Yes, sir.
- This guy you're supposed to play, Jim Burnham, you called him something else.
- k*ll.
- Heard he k*ll nine men in the Foreign Legion.

- Nice to see you.
- Right? Yeah, you remember Sarah? I do.
- This is Chalmers, my mute manservant.
- We have received your wire and account information.
- On behalf of our investors, we're very excited to have you aboard.
- Oh, I bet. I bet.
- Follow me.
- Will do.
- I was to be your accountant.
- What I did was, I improvised.
- Okay. (grunts)

- You're doing great. Just stay on point.
- Remember the mission. Casey, you're up.

- (blipping)
- Excellent. Excellent, Casey. Excellent.
- Fiber optic cable leads all the way down that hall. That's probably where the vault is.
- I'll need a key card.
- Sarah?
- Sarah: I'm on it.
- As you can see, my fortune is based on shared wealth.
- Finding others who enjoy the better things in life.
- Sarah: Yeah, that's very bold, Mr. Bale.
- Chuck... this jerk's starting to get handsy with my girl.
- Ourgirl. Yourgirl.
- Calm. Calm, Morgan!
- Just calm down. No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
- I think I'm gonna zoom, okay?
- I can feel it coming on-- a little kung fu.
- I am gonna karate chop this guy in the face.
- No, no, no, no. No, no.
- Do not do that. You're gonna zoom too soon.
- Premature zoom? Really? Crap!
- Okay, okay, what do I do?
- Think about baseball.
- Baseball.
- Why baseball? I mean, come on. It is so boring.
- I mean, just pitch the damn ball already!
- And enough talk with the statistics!
- Chuck, do you know what a slugging percentage is?
- 'Cause I don't know what a slugging percentage is, all right? And honestly, who the hell cares? !

- All right, that worked. Thank you, buddy.
- Thank you. I'm good.

- Morgan, Sarah, distraction time.
- All righty, Chuck. Am I up?
- Oh, you are up, buddy. Zoom away.
- (sighs)
- I like that.
- (dance music playing)
- Sarah?
- Let me show you how it's done.
- ♪ ♪
- (beep)
- Nice work, Morgan.
- (computer chirps)
- (trilling)
- We're in.
- Bingo. Now, once all the accounts are downloaded, we can reroute them to the original investors.
- (breaker clacks)
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What's happening?
- (static, beep)
- Decker.
- Hello, Chuck.
- What are you doing?
- I'm using your computer to access Bale's accounts and freeze them.
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- You're gonna trigger the alarm. My people are still inside.
- Yo people?
- Cute.
- (music playing, applause and cheering)
- (applause, cheering and whooping)
- Listen, I know you lied to me, I know I'm not part of your bigger plan, whatever the hell that is, okay?
- You've won. Now let us go.
- Payback's a bitch, Charlie.
- No... Guys, guys, get out of there!
- Mr. Carmichael?
- Darling, I know what you did with my key card.
- Come with me now, or I will k*ll you in front of all of my friends.
- Uh-uh. I think actually what's gonna happen is, I'm gonna open up a big can of--
- Come with us. What?
- Come with me, Colonel. Oh, I'm sorry.
- You used to be a colonel.
- Morgan, Sarah, Casey, please, tell me what's happening.
- (computer trilling)
- (trilling)
- I'm locked out of the accounts! What have you done?
- Do anything to us, and you'll never have access to those accounts ever again.
- You see, we work with somebody.
- A master spy who always has a plan.
- Okay. Okay, this isn't good.
- No plan, no plan.
- The master spy does not have a plan.
- Uh, I don't want to hear her voice anymore.
- Take 'em all downstairs. I'll decide what to do with them later.
- I need you to get somebody from our computer team on the phone right now!
- Man: Yes, sir.
- I think I have a plan.
- Computer emergency?
- What's wrong with it?
- An outside computer is accessing your system.
- You're under attack.
- Don't worry. I cut into the attack, and your accounts are still here.
- Is it fixed?
- Yeppers.
- Get rid of him.
- Huh? Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What's happening? I'm just the IT guy.
- You saw some things you weren't supposed to see.
- And I don't like your face. k*ll him.
- Then the others.
- I'd think twice about that, Bale!
- I pull these wires, your firewall goes down, and the CIA is inside of you in seconds.
- Your computer.
- Inside of your computer in seconds.
- Who are you?
- Carmichael.
- Charles Carmichael.
- I have your brother Michael.
- I know, and you're gonna let him and the others go.
- I so much as sneeze, and, well, you lose all your money.
- Oh! (laughs)
- Oops. That was about ten million bucks right there, Rog.
- Let 'em go.
- What the hell is going on?
- You're free to go.
- Hey, Chuck? Chuck, can you hear me? Where are you?
- Sarah, you outside?
- Sarah: Yeah.
- They let us go. Are you still inside?
- Don't worry about me. Just go.
- No, I'm-I'm not going anywhere.
- Sarah, you, Casey and Morgan, get in the van and leave right now.
- Did I do great?
- Shut up, moron.
- Chuck, I am not leaving my husband on a mission.
- Sarah... Sarah, I'm sorry.
- I wanted to buy you the house.
- I wanted to give you the future that you've always dreamed of.
- But more than that, I want you to live.
- Come on. What?
- Don't make me die in vain.
- Leave me behind.
- Get in the van.
- Leave. Leave me behind!
- Casey, we can't just leave him behind like that.
- Please, leave!
- Guys, please don't leave me behind! I have a plan.
- Your friends are safe, but you're stuck here.
- What were you thinking?
- Actually, I was thinking fast.
- Listen, there's-there's a button on the control panel.
- Hit that button.
- I just hope they got my message.
- (whirring, powering down)
- (alarms sounding)
- Morgan, disconnect us from the building's electrical line.
- Casey, get the van moving.
- Sarah, there's a rather large window on the east side of the building.
- It's the only way out... so I'm going to be jumping through it.
- Casey, east side of the building-- go, go, go, go!
- (alarms sounding)
- (tires squealing)
- (engine revving)
- Chuck: And Sarah, no matter what happens,
- I love you.
- (tires squeal)
- Ow! Ooh!
- Chuck: Also, if at all possible, if you could check to make sure I'm still alive on the roof of the van, that would be great.
- Good work, Chuck!
- Thanks, honey.
- Hey, dude, that was awesome!
- Listen, guys, team, let's-let's... let's not get down, okay?
- Yes, that was not a classically successful mission, but, you know, we all made it out alive, uh, so-so, that-that's a plus.
- And the news says that Bale was arrested, so, I think we should put that in the win category.
- Win, uh, win with an asterisk maybe.
- (clears throat)
- It's not that, Chuck.
- Well, okay, what is it then?
- Decker froze Bale's accounts, which included the money we transferred in.
- Castle and the Buy More are the only things that aren't frozen.
- Sarah: Decker froze all of our money because he tracked our deposit back to us.
- Wait.
- Wait. What?
- All of our... all of our money?
- We have nothing?
- Payback's a bitch.
- Morgan: Okay, think about it.
- We still have the Buy More, and-and we still have me.
- And, uh, Sarah and Casey, you.
- This is still a team. We can still do this.
- I think I, uh... I think I need a little air.
- Chuck...
- Chuck...
- Listen, it's okay. We'll bounce back. We always do.
- Yeah.
- I got to... uh...
- I'll be back.
- (car door opens)
- Sarah: Chuck, you found it.
- What's the matter?
- I can't afford it.
- If I bought it yesterday with our fortune, we'd own it, but now...
- (sighs)
- I'm so sorry, Sarah.
- Well, so what?
- I mean, we knew this wasn't gonna be easy, and we didn't get married because we thought life was easy.
- We got married so that we could be there for each other when things got tough.
- So we could work through things together, rich or poor.
- But how are we going to do this? I mean, we got to start over.
- It's okay. We'll get new clients and new missions.
- And we haven't lost everything.
- We still have Castle and the store.
- The Buy More.
- The Buy More.
- The Buy More.
- We use the store to support the spy team.
- We take Buy Mores' profits, put them into Carmichael Industries until both companies can make money.
- But in order for that to work, the store actually has to turn a profit.
- We can do that.
- We can do that.
- What about me, though?
- You and Casey are super spies.
- Morgan's the Intersect.
- Who am I? What's my job?
- Chuck, you're our leader.
- (camera shutter clicking)
- That's the plan.
- (computer chirps)
- As you can see, our superiors' interference in Chuck Bartowski's life has only just g*n.
- Now you understand how important he is.
- And why he must fail.
- You all have your orders.
- This is the plan.
- Its final chapter.
- Nothing can stop it.
