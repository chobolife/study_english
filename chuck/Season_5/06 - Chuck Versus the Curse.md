# Chuck Versus the Curse

- Hey I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that might need to know or maybe you just forgot.
- Why'd you bring us here?
- I need you to do a job for me.
- We've been tracking a computer super virus named the "Omen. "
- Bring it back to me, Mr. Casey goes free.
- The virus is too dangerous to be released into the world!
- It could wipe out everything.
- What are you planning on doing with it?
- The real question is what do you plan to do with it, Chuck?
- You're gonna break me out of here alone?
- Prisoner transfer, section 38.
- Man: Copy that.
- Give me one reason not to k\*ll you.
- It will only further prove your guilt.
- Chuck: Let's go right now.
- Hey, Decker, aren't you forgetting something?
- (beeping)
- So Verbanski blew up Decker.
- That was pretty messed up.
- And now the CIA wants to frame me for something awful.
- That's bad, too.
- But there is something else going on here.
- Something personal. Who's after us, Sarah?
- I don't know, but we're gonna get the team back together and we're gonna figure this out.
- Where are they, anyway?
- They were supposed to be here an hour ago. Did they get caught?
- You want to explain to me what I'm doing in the ducts of Castle?
- This is our Castle. Our secret base.
- Maybe my plan was a bit overly cautious, okay, but Verbanski was very complimentary of it.
- We should have gone in through the front door.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- You're are a fugitive, okay, and there's a mysterious CIA plot to destroy you, Chuck and Sarah, perhaps even me.
- Ah. Keep your ego in check, will ya, huh, Grimes?
- Okay. What if, though?
- What if Castle's been compromised?
- That's...
- I'm proud of you, moron.
- Did you just compliment me... and insult me?
- (grunts) We're here.
- Chuck!
- Hey, stand back!
- Sorry we're late.
- Someone needed a sandwich.
- And then someone needed a fruit cup, so...
- Well, we're just happy that you're back.
- Where's Verbanski?
- Well, since she disposed of Decker, she felt it best to stay out of the country till things die down a bit.
- Just when things were getting going between you two. So painful!
- I mean, that hurts.
- Man, that's tough.
- I just said what I was thinking out loud, didn't I?
- I'm sorry, Casey.
- Yeah, she was a hell of a woman.
- Still is. She's not dead and neither am I. Let's get on with it.
- Right, well, before Decker blew up, he was after this, the Omen.
- A computer virus that can erase a hundred zettabytes of data per second.
- Whoa. A hundred zettabytes?
- Is that a real thing?
- It could take down the Internet, crash airplanes and erase every database in the world, so, yeah, it's real.
- If the people trying to frame Chuck are coming from inside the CIA, we need to find Beckman.
- Or... she can find you.
- This is an official communique I requested to tell you myself.
- For the m\*rder of Agent Decker as well as the crime of treason against the United States, the CIA is placing all of you under arrest.
- What? General, how can you do this?
- I'd ask your team the same.
- If you know what's good for you, you'll stay put.
- Agents are on the way.
- I put my trust in you for years and look what you've become: traitors.
- Gen... ! How can she... ?
- Even Beckman's against us. How did this happen? !!
- You clever dame.
- What are you doing?
- She's amazing.
- What are you talking about? !
- Casey: Look, Morse code. She was giving us a warning, telling us to run.
- We have exactly five minutes to get out of here before the CIA comes charging in.
- She said all that?
- We need to get out of here.
- All right, let's go to my father's cabin and access the CIA's database using his Orion system.
- Find out who's after us.
- Roger that. I'll find Beckman.
- Let you know when I know something.
- Guys, I know we've been chased before, but I got a bad feeling about this.
- It's like were being hunted.
- Chuck, it's okay, we can handle it.
- Damn right. If we are being hunted, I need to get to the apartment and wipe my computer clean.
- Too dangerous.
- The complex is probably surrounded by agents.
- Then I go.
- Makes sense. I'm not a fugitive. They're not hunting me.
- I can do this.
- Okay, I'll show you what to do.
- You all right? You ready to go?
- Yeah.
- Babe, you ready to go?
- Don't come in here! I'm still getting ready.
- ♪
- Babe?
- Okay. Ready.
- Whoa.
- It is so awesome that you're my wife.
- Thank you.
- Honey, are you sure Clara's gonna be okay?
- Babe, Clara's fine.
- She's with my parents.
- This is what we wanted, remember?
- Fancy dinner, a nice hotel... mini vacay.
- You're right, you're right.
- It's been way too long since we've had time, just the two of us.
- It's gonna be a great night, I promise.
- And I have a little surprise for you.
- Mmm... I might have a little surprise for you, too.
- One more move and I will end you.
- Damn it. And I was trying to be discreet. Man!
- Morgan? !
- Yeah. Yeah, it's me.
- Morgan, what are you doing breaking into your own apartment?
- Doing a favor for your dad... and not trying to be seen.
- I broke him out of jail.
- The CIA's kinda sorta hunting him.
- I know.
- The authorities contacted me.
- I just, I thought maybe he would be here.
- The whole team's on the lam.
- He's not coming back here. Not for a while, anyway.
- Okay.
- How have you been?
- Are you all right?
- (knocking)
- I got this.
- (g\*n cock)
- Okay.
- Please, whoa. Yeah, sure. I mean, could you at least wipe your feet before you... ?
- Robyn Cunnings. Special Agent, CIA.
- I'm looking for John Casey and the rest of your team. Where are they?
- I don't know.
- Technically, I'm not part of the spy team anymore, so...
- What are you two doing here, anyway?
- Me and her?
- He's my boyfriend. You know, we're just hanging out at the apartment.
- The apartment that I live in... with her father.
- You live with your girlfriend's father?
- Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
- Seems a little awkward, sure, but it works, you know, for us.
- It's clear. He's not here.
- See? We told you.
- We don't know where my dad is.
- But I want him safe.
- He's a good man.
- Good men don't go on the run.
- If you see him or help him, you'll be aiding and abetting a fugitive.
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- We'll be right outside.
- Okay, okay.
- Nice. No, that was good, that was good.
- You all right? - Yeah. You did great.
- It was perfect.
- I'm your boyfriend, huh?
- It was a lie, Morgan.
- Don't get so excited.
- Not that excited.
- So I know we're gonna fix this and all, but do you think they're gonna bring Ellie in for questioning?
- Man, I wish I could call her.
- I know, I know, but they could've tapped her phone, and we don't want her implicated.
- We're not staying at this cabin, right?
- I mean, this thing's gonna blow over.
- I'm not disappearing on my sister, am I?
- Of course not, why would you say that?
- You know, us, wanted by the CIA, my family history. I'm just saying.
- Chuck, we're not gonna disappear like your parents.
- We're just hiding out for a little while, okay?
- Everyone's gonna be fine.
- Captain: Reservation for two under Woodcomb.
- I'm sorry, I don't have a reservation under that name.
- You know what? Check "Bartowski. "
- Boss, we've got a lock on the Bartowskis.
- Excellent. Let's get on it then.
- I used Chuck's Open Table account.
- He loves the points.
- There you are. Table for two.
- Mr. and Mrs. Bartowski, right this way.

- (whimpers)
- To a very special night.
- And a few little surprises.
- Babe, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.
- I, uh, I wanted something a little different, so I borrowed a dress from Sarah.
- She wore it on a mission in Bulgaria once.
- How wild is that?
- You ever wonder what it would be like if we lived a life of mystery and adventure like that?
- Like Chuck and Sarah?
- Like spies.
- Well, you know, spy work does run in our family.
- There's no reason why you and I can't pretend to be spies for tonight.
- Man, I'm glad we're not on the lam forever because I got to tell you, standing here, I'm feeling a little bit like I'm becoming my father.
- I can only imagine this is what he felt like the first day he had to leave us behind.
- You know, all alone in exile.
- That's not gonna happen, not if I've got anything to do with it.
- It's like it's my family's thing or something, u know The Bartowski Curse.
- The what?
- Every Bartowski has put their family in danger, then had to leave them in order to protect them.
- And I'm next.
- Chuck, there is no such thing as the Bartowski Curse.
- You're not going to be like your father, okay?
- You know why? Because you've got me.
- You're not alone. (computer chiming)
- Access granted.
- Okay, okay.
- It worked. We're in the CIA's mainframe.
- Okay, let's figure out who Decker was working for.
- Who's behind this?
- There's an active case file, but no lead agent listed.
- Not even the CIA knows who's in charge.
- It's a dead end.
- Captain: So we're gonna be spies?
- What do you say, six pack, are you in?
- Well, all right, hot mama.
- Maybe we should come up with a code word in case things get too hot.
- How about "martini"?
- And we can communicate with hand gestures.
- When we need to send a signal to one another, we can just tuck on our ear like so.
- Baby, you look so cool when you do that.
- May I take these plates?
- Well, if you'll excuse me, it's time to bring out your surprise.
- Copy that.
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- They've confirmed they have a I.D. on the target.
- It says they found us.
- If they're closing in on us, then we've got to get out of here.
- We have to run, for real this time.
- Sarah, this is exactly what I was afraid of.
- I'm sorry, Chuck. I know that... that you're not ready for this, but nobody's ever ready for something like this. We've got to go.
- Well, how long are we talking here?
- I don't know.
- But I know what you're thinking, and this has nothing to do with your parents. It has to do with us.
- You have to trust me.
- I've been on the run my entire life.
- And the only way this is going to work is if we stick together, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay, fine. But there's one thing I can't leave without.
- What? My pants.
- Your pants?
- Yeah, you got it, Chuck. I will get you your pants.
- It will be an honor.
- Hey, listen, I love you, man.
- Chuck's going on the run and he needs his pants?
- Well, they're his secret pants.
- Secret... You know what, it's best I just show you mine.
- Watch your hand.
- Right. Okay.
- Here.
- What's so special about them?
- Not so fast.
- Not so fast.
- Ever since we were kids, Chuck and I each had a box of pants.
- Private Artifacts Never to Share.
- We kind of went through an acronym phase.
- Anyways, this is where we kept our most sacred possessions.
- In case of a fire, this is what we save.
- And you both have these?
- Well, you know, Chuck's generally neurotic, and I was just terrified of my house burning down, since, you know, my house b\*rned down.
- Here we go.
- The 2000 Sangiovese.
- A little surprise for the wife.
- The same bottle we had at our wedding.
- She is going to love it.
- I'm thrilled for you. Really.
- Perfect.
- You okay, bro?
- Project Eagle is in effect.
- I'm here to take you and your wife to a secret location.
- We should leave quickly.
- Project Eagle?
- Your limo's just outside.
- I'll be waiting there for you and your wife.
- My wife.
- Project Eagle, hmm? Right.
- Be right there.
- Hey, what is it? Are we surrounded? Are there too many guys?
- No. That's just it-- there's nobody out there.
- Doesn't make any sense. Could they have made a mistake?
- They must have. (phone beeping)
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Just kind of weird.
- It's a reminder from Open Table to review my dining experience from tonight.
- Ellie must have used your Open Table account.
- She always does. She knows how I love the points!
- That means the operatives think that Ellie and Devon...
- Are us.
- (both laughing) (phone ringing)
- Oh, come on, babe, you're harshing on my spy vibe.
- I'm sorry, I thought it was off.
- There, done.
- Straight to voice mail again. No answer from Devon either.
- Oh, God.
- Sarah, I think Ellie and Awesome were taken.
- Honey, this is...
- Exactly what we needed.
- Yes.
- ♪
- (footsteps) (g\*n cocking)
- It took you long enough to find me.
- So this is where we come in our darkest hours.
- Iran-Contra, Nicaragua.
- The Clinton years.
- A group inside the CIA is conspiring to destroy Chuck.
- Who's behind it?
- I don't know.
- I need one of the conspirators.
- In the meantime, I'm doing everything I can to help Chuck and Sarah from here.
- But they're being hunted as we speak.
- And so is their family.
- (laughter)
- Captain: This is totally great.
- This car is so rad, babe.
- Where we going, anyway?
- Well, I don't know, Sixer, you tell me.
- Whoa!
- (tires squealing)
- You, uh, you sure your driver has his livery license?
- My driver? This is your surprise.
- My surprise?
- My surprise was a bottle of Sangiovese at the restaurant.
- Honey, are you telling me that neither one of us booked this car?
- There must be some mistake. We just have to talk to him.
- No, no, no, no, don't do that.
- What? Why?
- Because Project Eagle, the limo, what if... what if we open that thing and he sh\*\*t us?
- I've seen it in movies.
- Babe, what if we're on a real spy mission?
- Martini! Martini!
- Please tell me you're not about to do something foolish.
- Me, foolish? No.
- This is just me preparing.
- This is the gear that I need to get Chuck's pants without being seen by those very large, very scary agents who are waiting outside for us.
- And how exactly are you planning on doing that?
- That's the easy part.
- See, I hop out the side window and I climb up onto the roof and I sh\*\*t a cord over to Chuck and Sarah's place.
- I zip line across, I sneak into the back patio, grab Chuck's pants. In and out.
- Never even being seen. Easy.
- At least it was when I had a computer in my brain.
- That is crazy.
- Not only are you going to get caught, but you'll probably break your neck.
- Oh, thanks.
- Look, I know I was a jerk, and I know that you're mad at me, and I deserve that, okay?
- I've made many, many poor decisions.
- This is not one of them, okay?
- I have to help my friend.
- Morgan, wait.
- I have a better idea.
- (voice breaking): Hi. Yes, I'd like to report an emergency.
- Yeah, my crazy ex-boyfriend's outside my house.
- And I think that he might do something really dangerous.
- Yeah, that's right. Okay, he's, uh, six-feet tall and he has blond hair and he's wearing a black suit.
- Could you hurry please? Because I'm really, really scared.
- Thank you.
- There. Okay, so as soon as you hear the sirens, just go.
- I think I bought you about ten minutes maybe.
- That was-- diabolical.
- Ellie: Honey, we have to form a plan.
- Babe, deep breath.
- It's going to be okay. I have an idea.
- Okay, I'm listening.
- All right... We need to dive out of the car.
- We'll be fine.
- All we need is a sturdy combat roll.
- I can't do it.
- Of course you can.
- You have done way harder things.
- You need to just open the door and roll out.
- Devon, you don't understand, okay?
- I went to Agent Provocateur and I got an outfit, and the panties were optional and I didn't opt to wear them.
- Really?
- Surprise.
- Whoa.
- Casey, Casey, finally.
- Look, we got big problems.
- I think Ellie and Awesome were abducted.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know?
- Yeah, they were taken by Beckman's men.
- Don't worry, she's helping us.
- Oh, thank God.
- Listen, we have to get her agent on the phone, okay?
- Ellie and Awesome are probably freaking out.
- I'm going to meet up with the car and bring them to Beckman myself.
- Roger that.
- (phone ringing)
- Yes, General?
- What kind of lingerie was it again?
- Devon, concentrate!
- Okay. Babe, babe, the car's slowing down.
- We can do this. Just like Chuck and Sarah.
- Tuck and roll.
- Okay, ready?
- Ready.
- No peeking.
- One...
- Two...
- Three!
- Babe, babe, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
- We got to get out of here.
- (alarm chiming)
- General, we may have a problem.
- See, they're safe with Beckman's men.
- Nothing to worry about.
- I'll track them down, and then I'll call you back.
- Looks like you lost your passengers.
- Robyn, what are you doing here?
- Oh, Simms.
- (silenced g\*n)
- I think we lost him.
- Yeah, for now.
- Oh, God!
- Mr. and Mrs. Bartowski.
- No, there's a mistake, okay? We're the Woodcombs.
- Chuck's my brother, though. Who are you?
- Robyn Cunnings, Special Agent with the CIA.
- Somebody's after you.
- But don't worry, I work with your brother.
- You work with Chuck? W-Where's Chuck?
- He's on his way, but I was closer, so he sent me to get you.
- Please, you have to come with us immediately.
- I'm here to help.
- Captain: Okay. Let's go.
- Who is that?
- Sarah, where are they?
- Captain: Thank you.
- No, thank you, Mr. Woodcomb.
- It's now or never, Morgan.
- Move like the wind.
- (garbled radio transmissions)
- The coded message we found was from Decker's men.
- They were following Ellie and Awesome the whole time, mistaking them for us.
- Beckman: And they sh\*t Simms to cover their tracks.
- We have to find whoever is in charge and put a stop to this.
- If they think Ellie and Awesome know anything about the Omen, they'll torture them for sure.
- What are we doing just sitting here then?
- What's the plan?
- I'm sorry, Chuck.
- But for now, we wait.
- They'll call to set up a meet.
- How can we just wait?
- Ellie and Awesome are probably having their fingernails ripped out of their hands as we speak.
- (Captain groaning)
- (chair humming, Captain groans)
- (laughs)
- Babe, it's like a real masseuse.
- I can literally feel her fingers on my spine.
- Or his or whoever's, but, you know...
- Oh, we got to get one of these in the living room.
- Sounds great.
- Mr. and Mrs. Woodcomb, again, I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.
- Your brother will be here soon to pick you up.
- In the meantime, I hope these accommodations will suffice.
- We reserve this room only for the most regarded of spies.
- Can I offer you anything to drink?
- A soda pop?
- Some water perhaps?
- Actually, we-we were on a date tonight.
- So some wine, if possible.
- Sangiovese, perhaps?
- It would be my pleasure.
- Bring that insufferable woman a bottle of wine and get me Chuck Bartowski on the phone.
- (phone vibrating)
- Oh.
- Ellie, thank God.
- Robyn: Lovely sister you have.
- Husband's not so bad, either.
- Can't say I'm fond of them long-term, though.
- You listen to me. I don't know who the hell you are, but if you touch one hair on my sister's head...
- Come on, Chuck, spare us both.
- They're comfortable for now, and I prefer it stay that way.
- But if things get complicated, I can't guarantee their safety.
- Let me tell you how this is gonna work.
- What'd they say?
- We have three hours to deliver the Omen... or they k\*ll Ellie and Awesome.
- Mm, they're bluffing.
- We need to start making a fake to deliver right away.
- No. A fake? What if they figure out it's a fake?
- I know you're scared, Chuck, but we just can't hand over a w\*apon.
- Casey: It's bigger than us, Bartowski.
- It's national security.
- Look, I promise that we will take every precaution.
- I will not let them do anything to your sister.
- You guys are the pros.
- You know what you're doing.
- So... let's go with the fake.
- Hey.
- Look, I know you're concerned.
- Talk to me. I'm scared, Sarah.
- This is a mistake, this whole plan is a mistake.
- Giving them a fake virus is a mistake.
- Ellie and Awesome are in danger, and we need to give them the real virus in order to get them back.
- And I-I think I have to do it alone.
- No, you don't have to do it alone.
- There are people here who are with you.
- I'm with you, and I happen to think you're right.
- This is my curse, Sarah.
- Don't you understand?
- The people I love are in danger, it's my fault, I need to fix it. Forget about the curse.
- I'm gonna go out there, I'm gonna talk to Casey and Beckman, convince them that your plan is the right thing to do, and then we'll go together.
- You heard them.
- Th-They're never gonna be on board with this.
- Trust me.
- I will talk to them.
- And what if they say no?
- It's gonna take some time, okay?
- Okay, fine.
- I'll wait right here.
- Okay, good.
- Honey, I can't find my phone.
- Probably just fell out when we, when we rolled out of the car, babe.
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- Hey.
- I'm sorry, there was no Sangiovese.
- But, uh, I managed to rustle up some Chardonnay.
- My apologies if it's not that good.
- It's only a 2009.
- No worries, bro.
- This'll be fine.
- Hardly.
- I forgot the ice.
- Oh, but we did find this in the car.
- Oh.
- Thank you.
- See, babe?
- All's well that ends well, huh?
- Right? (chuckles)
- Anyway, I'll go get the ice.
- Okay.
- What the hell are you doing? !
- They're gonna k\*ll us.
- What are you talking about?
- He just brought us wine.
- No, no. Okay, I've been in this situation before.
- The CIA doesn't bring you wine.
- Look, they stole my phone and they called Chuck with it.
- So it's clearly some sort of ransom situation.
- I don't know.
- We got to find another way to get out of here.
- General, I think we're making a mistake.
- Ellie and Awesome are not spies, they're civilians.
- We know what this group is capable of.
- Suppose a fake could put them over the edge.
- They're savages-- reckless and single-minded.
- I think we need to support Chuck.
- This is his family, and it's my family, too, now, and we need to do everything we can to protect them.
- Let's get the Omen and find Chuck.
- (doorbell buzzes)
- Boss, I think you need to look at this.
- (doorbell buzzes)
- Hi there.
- It's me, Chuck Bartowski.
- From the phone call.
- Right on time.
- Well, hand over the Omen.
- You didn't think I was actually dumb enough to bring it in here with me, did you?
- It's hidden.
- Release my family or you can spend the rest of your lives searching for a virus you're never going to find.
- Follow me.
- What the hell?
- How did this happen? !
- I guess you've never met my sister.
- Upstairs clear.
- No sign of the Woodcombs.
- Man: Copy that.
- Orders are sh\*\*t to k\*ll on sight.
- This is really hard-core.
- I told you.
- I'm not giving you anything until I know my sister and her husband are safe.
- (scoffs)
- You're not exactly in a position to bargain now, are you?
- There's something I'm known for, Chuck.
- Some people call it torture.
- I like to think of it as more of an art form.
- You're going to give me exactly what I want.
- And I'm very, very good at this.
- Ellie: Honey, Chuck came to save us.
- He's in trouble, babe.
- We have to help him.
- We can't just go down there.
- We need, we need a tactical advantage.
- I can handle anything you throw at me.
- (clicking tongue)
- They always say that.
- So sad.
- Bring out the Toy.
- Whoa, whoa.
- R-Really? Really?
- That's the Toy?
- I don't think children should be involved with that device in any way, shape or form.
- Ellie: It looks like all the lits are hooked up to that electrical panel.
- If we can get that guard away, we can short the circuits, cause a blackout.
- That's genius, babe.
- Okay, okay, you cause the distraction, I'll blow the power and I'll go grab Chuck.
- We can do this, honey.
- Like real spies.
- Babe, right now we are real spies.
- Do you ever cry, Chuck?
- Sometimes.
- Particularly during sports movies.
- Field of Dreams is just-- it's gut-wrenching but also uplifting.
- A good cry is cathartic.
- (machine starts)
- I need a piece of metal, something to short the fuse.
- Oh. Here, here.
- But you can't just jam that piece of metal in the circuit breaker.
- You're gonna burn your hands.
- You're right, you're right.
- I need something to insulate it.
- Here, shirt, shirt.
- Oh, you look hot.
- So do you.
- I love you.
- (machine humming)
- One last chance.
- Omen... or pain?
- The Omen?
- Or pain?
- Shouldn't there be a third option?
- (sighs)
- What are you doing?
- Who? Me?
- Where's your shirt?
- It's kind of a long story.
- Let me tell you the short one.
- This is going to be very, very painful.
- Here we go.
- (g\*n cocking)
- Sorry, Chuck.
- There's usually a backup generator.
- Oh.
- Just FYI.
- Oh, my God.
- Sarah: I can't believe he'd do the drop on his own, without me.
- He thinks it's the Bartowski Curse-- that he can somehow protect me by leaving me behind-- and instead, he's walking into a trap.
- Let's just hope he's smart.
- If he gives up the Omen, they're all dead.
- Chuck: Hey, thanks for trying to save me, by the way.
- I... I really do appreciate it. No sweat, man.
- It just kind of seemed like the right thing to do, you know.
- Are you done?
- (electrical crackling)
- Tell me where you hid the Omen, or I permanently change this man's face.
- Not the face.
- No.
- Out the front door.
- It's out the front door. It's 30 paces south, buried under the yellow rosebush just to the right.
- You're joking.
- You're not joking.
- (clang)
- (silenced g\*n)
- (gasping)
- Oh, my God! Thank you!
- It's going to be okay.
- Rescuing Bartowskis is our business.
- Robyn: I'm a little upset I didn't get to use the Toy.
- It's truly my favorite part.
- Why are you doing this? Do you have any idea how much damage that virus will cause?
- In truth, Chuck, the virus is just a piece of the plan.
- What do you mean?
- Means I don't know.
- I'm just doing my job, cleaning up Decker's mess.
- I release the virus, and then I'm done.
- What happens now?
- That's the real surprise, isn't it?
- You've pissed off a lot of powerful people, Chuck.
- There.
- The Omen is officially unleashed upon the world.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Woodcomb.
- I'm afraid I don't need you anymore.
- You still don't know who you're dealing with, do you?
- Right now, there's a spy in your midst, and she's going to take you and all your men down to save her husband.
- Your sister? The doctor?
- (clanging)
- Are you kidding me?
- Again?
- (rapid g\*n)
- Casey: All clear.
- Sarah: All clear.
- Put down the g\*n.
- Now.
- Walker. Casey.
- I give up.
- Robyn Cunnings.
- You don't get off that easy.
- Safe. Come on out.
- Chuck?
- Devon, honey, are you okay?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.
- I'm good.
- I'm just really cold.
- Ellie: I love you. I love you.
- We are so not meant to be spies.
- Don't worry. I'm fine, too. Really.
- I love you... so much.
- You're upset. I can see you're upset.
- This isn't over.
- Hey, Sarah.
- Guys?
- I'm still... I'm still...
- I'm still tied. I'm still bound.
- Little help.
- Looks like we found the conspirator.
- You're going to tell me everything, Robyn.
- What exactly the plan is.
- Who you're working for. All of it.
- I have nothing to say to you.
- You're not my general.
- You know, we found something interesting at the factory.
- I'm very excited to see how it works.
- I believe you call it the Toy.
- (high-pitched whirring)
- (electrical crackling)
- Robyn has confessed to the conspiracy.
- I am happy to say, on behalf of the U. S. government, all charges against this team have been dropped.
- Oh, and Casey, your record shall be expunged.
- You're free to go home.
- General, that's all fantastic news, uh, but what about the Omen virus?
- And who did Robyn work for?
- Robyn didn't know, but we have our top people working on the virus.
- For now... well done, team.
- It was a bit like old times, wasn't it?
- So... no living on the lam, running from the law.
- Sounded a little romantic, didn't it?
- You're still mad.
- You left without me.
- I'm sorry, Sarah.
- I'm sorry.
- Okay? It was stupid. But I didn't want to take you down with me and my family's curse.
- There is no curse.
- You're not your father, Chuck.
- You're not fated to be alone or to hurt anybody.
- Those things happen because of the choices that people make.
- That you make.
- You're right.
- I'll never do it again, leave without you.
- The Bartowski Family Curse ends here, and-and-and not with me; with us.
- If you ever go out alone again, just remember, I'm a trained assassin.
- Noted.
- Good.
- You wouldn't sh\*\*t me, would you?
- Morgan: Yeah?
- Great news, man.
- The agents are dispersing.
- I wonder what's going on.
- Yep. You got it, Chuck.
- Mission aborted.
- I'll see you soon. Okay.
- Great news-- we're not on the lam anymore.
- We don't even need Chuck's PANTS box.
- That's great.
- But you just got it.
- Yeah. It's all right. I'll sh\*\*t over to the apartment, and I'll put it back.
- It's not a problem. Just got to ask-- what's in Chuck's PANTS?
- No, no, no, no.
- Not allowed.
- Here's something I can show you, however.
- (sighs) I want you to have this.
- You know, in case something terrible has happened.
- You keep an eye on it.
- Last night was nuts, huh?
- Yeah. Crazy.
- It was crazy. It was.
- But despite all the craziness, kind of a nice date.
- Morgan... that was not a date.
- Yeah, no, well, not in the conventional sense.
- You're right.
- I should go.
- Okay, I'll go. Okay.
- Okay.
- Um... thank you for everything.
- Yes. You, too.
- All right.
- (sighs)
- I know that I am supposed to be tired and a little freaked out, but last night was...
- Kind of incredible.
- Yeah.
- When you cracked that baddie over the head with the bottle, that was pretty hot.
- I was going to say the same thing when you took out that electrical panel.
- What were you saying earlier about Agent Provocateur?
- So all's forgiven?
- Maybe.
- Okay, fine.
- All's forgiven.
- Oh, something's wrong with the computer.
- (rapid electronic trilling)
- You mean all the computers.
- What is going on?
- Sarah, it's the Omen virus.
- It's affecting our entire system.
- It's not just our system.
- That is the Internet. That is everybody.
- Oh, my God. This is all my fault.
- I let it out, and now the code is digging in.
- It's... it's hiding in every networked computer in the world-- just waiting.
- Waiting for what?
- I don't know.
- (static droning)
