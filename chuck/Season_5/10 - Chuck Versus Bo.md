# Chuck Versus Bo

- Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know.
- The Intersect made me a total jerk.
- Not that it was completely the Intersect's fault.
- I mean, it just kind of brought out my inner jerk.
- Don't scuff it, all right, Cabbage Patch?
- I am really sorry for what I did to Alex.
- Chuck: This whole thing has gotten me thinking about our... our lives, our future.
- Is the spy lifestyle really where we want to be raising our kids?
- This is what I think our coworkers are really up to.
- You think they're spies?
- I knew it! Lester...
- ♪
- Okay.
- For the record, I love this.
- This is the most fun you and I have had together in quite some time.
- Yeah. We should make more time for us.
- (sighs) Anyway, I still don't get it-- I don't see how this is going to make them forget that they found Castle.
- X-13 gas.
- Short-term memory eraser.
- They'll forget the last 24 hours.
- Oh, right. Gotcha.
- They come to, think they tied one on in Vegas, boom, they're back to normal.
- Or whatever normal was for these guys.
- Yeah. Right. (grunts)
- Pop this right here. (laughing): Watch this.
- Ah, that's not professional.
- Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good.
- Good?
- (banging)
- (footsteps)
- ♪
- (sighs)
- Wow. Wow.
- Okay.
- Okay, let's, uh... let's talk about that.
- Look, I-I... I've been up all night, and I... I've been thinking about our futures and, you know, maybe babies.
- Oof. Yeah.
- And I want all of that, but the more I think about it, I just don't know if that future goes with the life that we're living right now.
- I mean, both of us have been captured more than once.
- Every day, we make a new dangerous enemy.
- And I just ran to the front door with a g\*n because I heard the newspaper being delivered.
- Yeah, parents can't be sh\*\*ting the paperboy.
- Look, I'm a spy, and that's all I ever thought that I could be, but I realized that we don't have to give up what we've already built.
- We can just shift what Carmichael Industries does.
- Okay, shift it to what?
- Countering cyberterrorism.
- It's your tech firm idea, but more spied up-- so we keep your computer know-how and mix it with my experience in international bad guy-ery.
- So we go after bad guys who use keyboards instead of b\*ll\*ts.
- Which means we don't have to use b\*ll\*ts, either.
- I mean, the timing of it does kind of feel right.
- We've got nothing left hanging.
- No new missions.
- No wrongs to right.
- Let's do it.
- Now, how do we pitch the idea to Casey?
- Morgan: Well, I love it.
- Okay? You know how I feel about b\*ll\*ts, which is to say negatively, okay?
- This is fantastic.
- Where do I fit in? What am I, chief Googler?
- Well, actually, you'd be doing a lot of the same stuff that you already do.
- Yeah, I mean, we're still going to need field ops to recover stolen systems and breaching companies' security to find their weak spots.
- (groans)
- Morgan: Plus, wouldn't it be lovely not to get sh\*t at?
- Chuck: Exactly.
- Aren't you sick of being sh\*t at?
- Or getting sh\*t?
- I mean, you get sh\*t a lot.
- Not considering how much I get sh\*t at.
- Mm. Mm.
- Okay. Think about Alex.
- Do you know how happy she will be, knowing that you're not out there doing scary stuff?
- (sighs)
- All right, I'll think about it.
- But one thing's for sure-- we go through with this, no more Buy More. We don't need a cover.
- Let's kick the creepy cousin out of the family.
- Wow.
- No more Buy More.
- ♪
- Son, this came for you.
- Boy, get your fingers out of there!
- Hey.
- How you doing, Big Mike?
- Always a beautiful day at the Buy More.
- You really love it here, don't you?
- Like a turkey loves Thanksgiving.
- You might want to rethink that one, actually, you know.
- My old iPhone.
- Doesn't really seem to be your style.
- No, no, yeah, this was from a few months ago.
- I was kind of going through a thing.
- Ah.
- The frosted tips phase. Yeah.
- Made it real hard not to smack you.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I can imagine.
- Oh.
- Lord.
- Chuck... Chuck, if you're getting this, something has gone terribly wrong.
- I was... I was getting my party on, having a great time.
- Okay, this dude comes up to me with this pair of Intersect glasses, and he grabs me.
- I kick his ass.
- No prob, as per yooszh.
- I grab the glasses, and I stash them.
- Dude, I stash them in a vault.
- But, like I was saying, I have been partying my freaking face off, so I'm a little discombobulated.
- Which is an amazing word.
- So, if this guy catches up to me, want you to know something.
- I know that you know that you love me.
- Tell the world of my glory.
- But above... above all, you find those glasses.
- You find them. Aah!
- Huh.
- Morgan, what is this, and where were you?
- I don't know, Chuck. I don't know.
- Between the Intersect mind-melting and, clearly, copious amounts of booze, it's all a blank.
- Thank God I bought that label maker you all made fun of, because at least I got the phone back.
- So there's a stolen Intersect out there somewhere.
- Guess we're not retired after all, huh?
- Well, it doesn't change the plan.
- It just means we have one last mission.
- Why would she...
- No! - Come on, Walker.
- What?
- Things never turn out well when you say "one last mission. "
- Is this just because of some stupid movie?
- Yes. Yes.
- You never say "one last mission. "
- Come on. Never.

- Yeah, I was... I was so cool back then.
- Chuck: Uh, counterpoint.
- Are you wearing a fake dreadlock ski hat?
- Morgan: Really? Is that...
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was.
- Look at the dates on these phone calls.
- It's when you were working for Verbanski.
- And look at these text messages.
- There's a name-- "BD. "
- Does that jog your memory?
- Negative.
- No, what does BD say?
- "Where'd you go? "
- Chuck: All right, well, maybe send BD a message.
- If they were with you the night you found the glasses, then maybe we can get a clue.
- Okay.
- Uh...
- "Sorry, disappeared.
- What's up? "
- No, I was a little more douchey than that.
- Uh, "Wassup? " You know, with a bunch of S's?
- Sure.
- And in the meantime, let's try and find a way to help you remember something.
- What is it exactly that you two think I do for a living?
- Brain science.
- I mean, didn't you learn how to hypnotize people at school to get at lost memories?
- Yeah, in psychotherapy class, but that was years ago.
- (sighs)
- Fine. Okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Okay, I really hope this works.
- I'm a little skeptical, 'cause...
- I don't think this brain can be hypnotized.
- It's like a fortress.
- So, focus.
- Look at the pen.
- Deep breaths.
- Mm-hmm.
- Breathe.
- Morgan.
- (bird screeching)
- ♪
- Ow.
- Sweet mother of all that is holy.
- Ow.
- Ow.
- Dude, what happened?
- Where are we?
- I don't... I don't know.
- You're wearing a Vegas hat.
- We must have gone to Vegas... and stole a car.
- Yeah, we must have just partied too hard, and now...
- Ow.
- A woman gave us her underpants?
- Breathe on me.
- (exhales)
- There's no alcohol on your breath.
- Just gefilte fish curry, like always.
- Really?
- Lester, something really weird is up.
- Yeah, last... last thing I remember is that there's something going on underneath the Buy More.
- Yeah, that's right-- with Bartowski and Grimes and Casey and that whorey blonde.
- We've got to get to the bottom of this.
- You're right.
- And we're going to do that by sticking to those fools like the stink on my breath.
- Now, to the Buy More.
- Careful.
- Careful.
- Light traffic day.
- Yeah.
- I think Morgan might really be hypnotized in there.
- Great. Hey, hey, look, I've been looking at, uh, some new possible office spaces.
- Above ground. We could have windows.
- (sighs)
- If we ever get there.
- What do you mean?
- It just seems like no matter what, the Intersect keeps finding me.
- I keep trying to break free, and the very thing that started this keeps hooking us back in.
- Chuck, we're going to finish this.
- And we're going to move on, I promise you.
- (sighs)
- Hey, Casey, you want to see your new office space?
- No, 'cause we ain't out yet.
- Even if it belonged to a little someone named Ronald Wilson Reagan?
- Seriously?
- The Gipper?
- Hey, guys, I got something.
- Morgan keeps repeating the phrases "emerald and gold" and the number "ten. "
- "Emerald and gold, " what does that mean?
- I don't know. I tried to push him a little further, but I think I got a little too aggressive.
- You are so hot.
- You're so hot.
- And if you went to prom with me, I would be the stokedest guy in high school.
- I think I took him back too far.
- It's possible.
- Okay, Morgan, let's undo this.
- Look at the pen.
- I don't know how to look at anything but you.
- You're so beautiful.
- Wow. Hey, I didn't say anything stupid while I was under, did I?
- (chuckles) No. No-no-no.
- You get a return text yet?
- (chuckles) No. No-no-no.
- Uh, are you the manager?
- I want to return this blender. Yeah, sure, I'll take care of that for you.
- Do you have a receipt? Let me check.
- Are you in a serious relationship?
- Excuse me?
- I just want to know if you're in a serious relationship right now.
- I'll call you back.
- Uh, I actually am, yeah. Anyway, back to the blender...
- Do you love her?
- That's a really personal question for a blender return.
- Dale, I told you to stop bothering me.
- Morgan, I am so, so sorry.
- Yeah, no, sure.
- Um, who's Dale?
- He's just a guy I went out with a few times when we broke up. He's nobody.
- Really.
- Nobody?
- Oh, so I guess it was nobody that-- wait, how did you put it? Filled your body with rainbows?
- Oh... (coughs)
- Please tell me he's talking about finger painting, all right?
- Because I don't even understand how that even works.
- Morgan, please, there's nothing between us, okay?
- I was just hurt, and I was missing you, and so I acted out a little physically.
- You acted out physically?
- Oh, I think I'm going to be sick.
- There were rainbows.
- (phone ringing)
- I love him, Dale. So just stop coming here.
- I... I got my text.
- Thank God.
- Morgan: Let's talk later, you and I, okay?
- There he is.
- Dale. Hey, John.
- What?
- You're the one that pulled the text message breakup.
- Alex, always great to see you.
- Dale, store credit only.
- Oh.
- We never hugged. Are you kidding me?
- Sorry.
- Where are they? We lost them, we lost them!
- She acted out physically? !
- Morgan, I know this is hard, but you did dump her via text.
- I know, the whole text thing.
- I know I shouldn't be mad, but I am.
- You want to know why?
- Because I was true blue, baby, that's right.
- While she was out there gallivanting all over town, spreading her filthy rainbows to every Tom, Dick and Harry, I stayed strong, dude. I did.
- You know what, I need to know every detail.
- Every little morsel I got to find out.
- Buddy, buddy, I know you're upset, but I don't think knowing all the gory rainbowed details is going to make you feel any better about it.
- Right, boss.
- Sarah: Guys, look.
- There's a Golden Peak Resort in Vail, Colorado, and...
- Look, here. It's a Michael Carmichael registered the night in question.
- Hey, looks like that's our ski town.
- All right, kids, let's pack up.
- Morgan, sadly you're going to need to look the way you did that weekend, so do you still have any more of that hair bleach and your Affliction T-shirt?
- Who would know?
- Why... ? Yes.
- Great, let's go.
- ♪
- Looks like all of Vail is here.
- Hope BD is, too.
- Any of this triggering a memory, Grimes?
- Nope, nothing yet.
- You two better love each other.
- It's sickening the amount of meaningless physical encounters that happen nowadays.
- Woman: Morgan?
- Bo Derek!
- BD?
- BD is Bo Derek?
- Wow.
- Thought I'd never see you again, lover.
- Hello, Bo Derek's tongue.
- Wow. Wow.
- Wow. Morgan, you need to stay with it.
- We need to find out everything she knows, okay?
- I thought for sure I'd hear from you sooner. Bad boy.
- You're the guy who made out with Bo Derek, so act like it.
- Yeah, I know. That's just bad boy stuff.
- That's just how I roll.
- Hi, Bo Derek. I'm Chuck.
- My name is Chuck.
- Really big, big fan.
- Just loved just so, so much. We really do.
- Yeah, I know what you did with that poster.
- Oh, no, no, no. I-- I wouldn't... Ew.
- Not that I didn't love the poster as a boy.
- How do you know my friend here? I don't like to kiss and tell, but your friend rocked my world one magical night in November.
- Seriously? Seriously?
- Seriously? Seriously?
- No, I'll never forget that... that evening.
- But, um, How did I got about that-- the rocking?
- Words would ruin it, but, uh, there were definitely rainbows involved.
- There's that... Check that out, there were rainbows.
- I guess Alex wasn't the only one with secrets, huh?
- Bo, what exactly happened that evening?
- Because I'm a little fuzzy, you know, with all the gluggity, gluggity, gluggity. You were a bit out of hand.
- Come on, I'll show you.
- I'm always out of hand.
- Chuck: Oh, seems like a lot of people might know what you did that night.
- Bo: He was telling everyone who would listen, how he'd saved the world that day.
- You're such a funny bunny.
- (chuckles) I am.
- What else did I mention?
- You know, because I lost something and I'm trying to retrace my steps.
- Yeah, what did Funny Bunny do when he left the bar? He came to my room.
- Sarah: Morgan, maybe the vault that the glasses are in is a safe in Bo Derek's room.
- You need to get up there now.
- I have a girlfriend.
- Casey: Yeah? Well, you should have remembered that two months ago.
- Now get to work.
- They're looking for a vault. Write that down.
- We are not forgetting anything this time.
- Morgan: Man, this brings back some memories.
- Speaking of which, you're not still staying in that room are you?
- Because if you are-- oh, boy, ding, ding, ding, round two.
- Come on. Yeah.
- Oh, have fun, tiger. You know I will.
- Mmm.
- You remember this?
- Yes, yes, I do. Who could forget this?
- Hey, now.
- Okay. Incidentally, Bo Derek, is this where the rainbows happened?
- I'm curious only because they've been coming up a lot lately, and I would love to know specifically what makes them happen? What is the trigger, you know.
- I'll show you.
- Yeah, cool. Can't wait.
- Taking off my pants now, Chuck.
- Oh, dude, Bo Derek is taking your pants off.
- Just go with it, okay? Ask her to tell you more about that night.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Hey, so, um, you know what I would lov-love, love? !
- Totally love, Bo Derek, is, um...
- Tell me the story about our night together.
- Oh, okay. Mm-hmm.
- But only if you tell me exactly what you've done since I was with you last.
- Deal, lover. So I first noticed you when you were getting a lap dance from that dirty whore Jaclyn Smith.
- And that was when he got the whole bar singing "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go, " unironically.
- Right, so he didn't tell you anything else about his night?
- He got me pretty wasted.
- I woke up the next morning behind the bar in a puddle of Rumplemintz.
- And then we played the funniest game, where you hid and I found you, and then I hid and you found me.
- (chuckling): Oh, man, so fun.
- Well, all I've been able to dig up is what we already know.
- Grimes was an ass.
- Yeah, I'm getting the same thing.
- Hey, Chuck, how's it going with Bo?
- Have you had any sneak peeks of your childhood crush's boobies?
- What? No.
- Shut up.
- (clearing throat) We have a situation.
- Oh, you are kidding me.
- How did they track us here?
- This is what you get when you fly commercial.
- I'll take care of it. Copy.
- Hey, were you just asking about Morgan Grimes?
- Uh, yes. Ha, ha, ha. That dude's hilarious.
- I gave him the most wacked tattoo ever.
- You gave him a tattoo?
- (phone buzzing)
- Tattoo.
- Morgan, I need you out here ASAP.
- Be careful.
- You know what I'm going to do?
- I'm going to get us a little fresh ice.
- What do you think about that? Okay.
- Yeah. Hurry back.
- No problem, okay.
- And bring back a couple extra cubes for play time.
- (chuckles)
- You two.
- Do whatever you want. We know what's going on here.
- We're not, we're not going to forget.
- I disagree.
- What is that? That smells nice.
- Doesn't it?
- That woman is into me.
- And I'm really scared that whatever is going to take place in there is going to be way worse than whatever acting out Alex did.
- Plus we were broken up, so technically...
- Buddy, buddy, you have a tattoo.
- No, I do not.
- What? Aw!
- What are you... ?
- Don't trust Bo Derek.
- That's what your tattoo says.
- Come on, she must be involved with the Intersect theft.
- (g\*n cocking)
- Not the strangest place a man has tattooed my name.
- Now take me to the glasses.
- I'm just going to go out and say it-- you're no longer a perfect 10.
- I know you remember something.
- My backup is on the way And you do not want to know what they will do...
- Sorry, I had to do that to your girlfriend.
- Oh... You didn't hit her in the face, did you?
- I'm kidding. But it is Bo Derek.
- Okay.
- (birds screeching)
- Lester: Ow. Sweet mother of all that is holy.
- Ow.
- Ow!
- Dude, what happened? Where are we?
- I don't... I don't know.
- You're wearing a Vegas hat.
- We must've gone to Vegas.
- Yeah, stole a car.
- Must have just partied too hard, and now... Ow!
- A woman gave us her underpants?
- Breathe on me.
- (exhales)
- There's no alcohol on your breath.
- Just gefilte fish curry like always.
- Last thing I remember was that there was something going on underneath the Buy More.
- Wait. We left ourselves a clue.
- "Bo Derek"?
- So...
- Bo...
- Bo Derek... tell me about your night with Morgan, and this time for real.
- Yes, please.
- And how Bo Derek got involved with the Intersect.
- Listen, acting isn't the only gig I got because of my looks and my capacity to make believe.
- Are you trying to say that Bo Derek is a spy?
- My boss had gotten word someone was running around the intelligence community, bragging that he was the Intersect.
- So we were already on the lookout for him when he surfaced so publicly one night in Vail.
- Publicly? Ah, I doubt that.
- Pretty sure I was keeping a low profile.
- Who wants to party with the freaking Intersect? !
- (all cheer)
- Whoo!
- I am the most powerful w\*apon in the world!
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
- ♪
- (door opens)
- ♪
- (speaking Portuguese)
- (chuckles) You, maybe.
- You, uh...
- Ooh...
- Hello...
- Hey, baby, you're gonna hate him!
- Oh, man...
- That was real?
- And a follow-up question: If that was real, were the rainbows real?
- (laughs)
- It meant nothing.
- It was only physical.
- What is it with women and this "only phys... "?
- Morgan!
- Uh, if you don't mind, what happened next?
- Then I drugged you and called my boss.
- Quinn: So this is what they put the Intersect into these days.
- What are you, an intern?
- Morgan: Hmm? You take that back.
- You take that back 'cause this Intersect... this Intersect can almost focus on your stupid face, and when I do...
- Shut up. Morgan Grimes-- aka Morgan Carmichael-- which is ridiculous.
- You're not the only one with the Intersect, honey bunny.
- Quinn: I spent a lot of time and money getting these glasses.
- I haven't used them yet because I hear there are side effects.
- Well, you seem fine.
- Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine. It's you.
- You made an enormous mistake telling me all this.
- See your men here? Done, finished.
- I'm gonna take them out.
- And then I'm gonna hunt you down, and I'm gonna arrest you for treason.
- I don't think so, 'cause you're not gonna remember any of this.
- X-13.
- As soon as you fall asleep, the last 24 hours of your little life will (snaps fingers) just disappear.
- And here's how confident I am of that.
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Nicholas Quinn.
- And I'm about to become the Intersect.
- (device whirs)
- Give me the glasses!
- Sorry, Bo Derek!
- Chuck: Okay, so we're looking for Nicholas Quinn.
- Bo Derek's been working for him.
- Bo Derek's a spy?
- I know, right?
- And a talky one to boot.
- Quinn's got an independent spy agency, but not like ours.
- Morgan: Ooh, nothing like ours.
- This guy's list of clients is gnarly. You're talking about Libyan Islamic fighting group, Kim Jong-il.
- And a couple of favorites as well, like FULCRUM, the Ring and Volkoff Industries.
- What? We've put some of his biggest clients behind bars.
- Did we get Kim Jong-il? He's been getting screwed by the Intersect for years. No wonder he wants it.
- Sarah: Okay, so the fat lip we can blame on the tattoo.
- The ski jacket and the boxers we can blame on Bo Derek, but where are the glasses?
- And where is this vault?
- I don't know. Guys, I don't know.
- Bo Derek said that was the last she saw of me.
- I wouldn't have just stashed the Intersect anywhere.
- I would have put it somewhere safe.
- Someplace that I knew. And that's, that's my guess, anyway.
- Alex.
- Oh, boy.
- Okay, let me, let me deal with this.
- I'll be back, uh...
- I gotta come clean on a few things.
- Buddy, buddy, are you sure you want to do that? Because I think maybe we should just, you know let the past be the past.
- I agree. It doesn't seem like telling her the Bo Derek story is gonna do anything except upset her.
- Yeah.
- You slept with Bo Derek?
- Yeah. Maybe more than once.
- I acted out physically, too.
- And I, uh, I rocked Bo Derek's world.
- (snorts)
- Sorry. Um, Morgan... Yeah?
- ... Dale, he doesn't matter, okay?
- You don't have to make up these stories.
- No, I'm not, I'm not lying. Are you kidding me?
- No. I made rainbows sh\*\*t out of this woman.
- There's Grimes. Let's just confront him.
- I know he's a part of this.
- Wait. We are being sabotaged. Mm-hmm.
- We gotta fly under the radar, quietly keep an eye on them and record on our person anything we learn.
- Great idea.
- I gotta pee.
- It's 3:14 p. m. Write that down.
- I think, though, it's better if neither of us knows the details of each other's rainbow-related activities.
- Look, you were with Dale, I was with Bo Derek, we're even. Let's move past it now.
- Okay. Okay, baby.
- We are even.
- That's my girl. Okay.
- (clears throat)
- Son, do you have the master key?
- I checked the vault, it wasn't there.
- What'd you just say?
- The key.
- I checked the manager's vault.
- Any ideas?
- (men shouting, g\*n)
- Sweet lady Buy More.
- Emerald and gold.
- (snaps fingers)
- Big Mike, is there a Buy More in Vail?
- Yep, there's a Buy More in Vail, and they had a break-in that night. Look.
- Of course, I knew it, I knew I put it somewhere familiar.
- It's in a manager's vault in Vail!
- Looks like all roads lead to the Buy More.
- I'm never getting out of this place.
- Wow, the Vail Buy More.
- Lot of broken limbs on these morons.
- I think you can only work here if you've broken something skiing.
- Grimes! Remember me, buddy?
- Yeah...
- Ha-ha, sweet! I just tweeted you were back in town.
- Beers tonight to celebrate, brah!
- Oh, yeah, sweet!
- He tweeted you're back in town?
- If Quinn has been waiting for us to come back and search, then...
- We gotta hurry.
- I fricking hate Twitter.
- Hello. Excuse me, Miss... ter.
- Uh, we're security specialists with Carmichael Industries. Corporate sent us to check out the recent break-in.
- Bored of you. Talk to Big Michelle.
- Right.
- Our security is rock-solid.
- I don't understand why Corporate felt we needed to be checked up on.
- This isn't any sort of criticism on your store.
- We just want to do a proper check for your safety.
- Now, if you could first take us to the manager's vault for a look-see.
- (sighs) Oh, man...
- How's a nice security check feel, Casey?
- This is about as extreme as it will get in our new job.
- Nice, easy-peasy last mission.
- Well, it ain't over. Keep your guard up.
- I just don't understand why no one told me you were coming.
- I'm gonna have to call and get the go-ahead before I open the vault, obviously.
- Well, so much for her helping us open the vault.
- Looks like we're gonna do some safecracking today.
- Yeah, well, hold on a second.
- Maybe not.
- Let me try something real quick here.
- One, two, three, four... boom.
- (blipping)
- Seriously.
- I was too lazy to change the code in Burbank, too.
- One thing you can always count on: Buy More laziness.
- Oh, no.
- Morgan: Where else could they be?
- Maybe somebody moved them.
- Like, maybe the person who is currently knocked out cold.
- Chuck: The place is hopping right now.
- This is the new expansion pack for g\*n 'n Gold.
- The vault...
- Could it be?
- A display copy.
- (laughs)
- Okay, well, nice work, Morgan.
- Let's go. Let's get out of here.
- Let's go.
- J'accuse!
- You people are spies!
- And we are not going to forget it, because it is right here on my arm.
- Yeah! What he said!
- (a\*t\*matic g\*n, people screaming)
- Quinn: Everybody out!
- Charles Carmichael.
- First guy who got it instead of me.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm former CIA, too.
- The Intersect was supposed to be mine.
- But then Larkin stole it for you, so I went back out in the field, and I got captured. (laughs)
- Oh, and tortured... in a hole the ground, for 378 days.
- In a hole!
- That was the best.
- And then I was broken.
- Dismissed.
- And all because the Intersect wasn't mine.
- You don't want it, Quinn.
- You do not want it. Trust me.
- It doesn't work right, okay?
- I lost memories, important movies, a bunch of stuff.
- Chuck: He's right. He's right.
- Listen, you don't want to trust me.
- Nothing good can come from it.
- (laughing)
- Take a good look at your wife.
- You think you'd get that without the Intersect?
- I tried to win without it.
- I... I tried.
- Now give it to me!
- Jeffrey... run!
- Nice sh\*t!
- (gasps)
- Thank you.
- No, no, Casey-- Casey, wait.
- Quinn didn't get the Intersect. We did it!
- We took down his team.
- Okay, let's call Beckman.
- Call the authorities.
- Tell them where he is.
- But... let's be done.
- Can't we just be done?
- We survived our last mission.
- Let's leave behind the Intersect and everyone involved with it, and be done.
- Okay.
- We're done.
- Okay. I'll call Beckman. Whoa!
- I'm not done. No, I am not done.
- I would like very much to forget everything-- everything that I saw here today.
- Here we go again.
- I'm scarred.
- Aw, buddy. So scarred.
- Chuck: Sorry, Casey.
- Looks like we can't kick the creepy cousin out of the family just yet.
- (exhaling)
- I knew it-- there's no alcohol on your breath.
- It's just gefilte fish curry, like always.
- I believe we've been set up.
- And what's all this?
- Huh.
- We must've gotten to the bottom of it, then.
- Guess we were wrong.
- That's kind of disappointing.
- So now what do we do?
- (car approaching)
- Hey, boys.
- Morgan told me you might've gotten stranded.
- Yeah, apparently, we did.
- Cheer up!
- I brought turkey BLT Subway footlongs.
- From the Fresh Fit menu?
- Yep. Watching my weight.
- How many you have?
- Only two.
- Also, I had a thought. Mm-hmm.
- We're already halfway to Vegas... Mm-hmm. and Bologna's doing some Native American feelings workshop about her period all weekend.
- Ew. But are you saying... ?
- All: Vegas, baby!
- ♪
- (phone ringing)
- Sarah?
- Hey. Did I wake you?
- No, it's... I mean, yeah, but it's okay.
- Where are you so early?
- I'm sorry, I-I couldn't sleep.
- I'm just, uh, I'm so excited about starting everything.
- I made an appointment at noon to check out some of these new office spaces, and I thought that we could get Casey and Morgan together and, um... have a little ceremony.
- You know, pop some champagne and toast to our futures, and, uh... destroy the Intersect glasses.
- I, um, I-I think that's the right end to this.
- Yeah. That sounds perfect.
- Turns out saying "last mission" wasn't a jinx after all, huh?
- I love you, Chuck.
- I love you, too, babe. Good-bye.
- Bye.
- Never let the bad guy get away.
- (phone ringing)
- Hey.
- Quinn: I have your husband.
- Bring the Intersect to the San Pedro docks, Pier 23, 2100 hours, or he dies. (click)
- Casey, where is everyone?
- You got anything?
- Casey, hold your fire. They've got Chuck.
- Sarah Walker, put the glasses down.
- You show me Chuck first.
- Situation's changed.
- He'll be needed. Now put the glasses down on the ground in front of you.
- It was a trap! Where is he?
- I don't know! We gotta get out of here!
- Casey, you got an exit?
- Casey: No!
- No, not from here.
- (grunts)
- What's our next move?
- Casey: I've got one clip left.
- (panting)
- Walker, no!
- Don't do it!
- Okay, I got this.
