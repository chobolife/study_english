# Chuck Versus the Goodbye

- Mr. Quinn, I understand you are interested in purchasing The Key.
- Ted Roark gave this to me.
- I worked at FULCRUM for ten years and this is all I have to show for it.
- Of course, the only person who can use it is someone with an Intersect.
- I have one of my very own, but the damn thing's glitchy; either it cooks your brain or it steals your memories.
- And I need The Key to fix it.
- Interesting.
- Edgar, keep that to yourself.
- I have a few enemies.
- You do realize that's only one part of The Key?
- There are two other pieces.
- Quinn: I do.
- My sources tell me a former member of The Ring acquired one from Volkoff a few years back.
- The Ring.
- What amateurs.
- Edgar... do you still carry that Walther under your jacket?
- Of course. Why do you ask?
- Sarah...
- You're upset... I can tell.
- You stole my memories and you ruined my life.
- (alarm beeping)
- (g\*n cock)
- Sarah...
- I'm still alive.
- (laughs)
- Come on.
- Go for the g\*n.
- You're so close.
- Go for the g\*n.
- (air whooshing, alarm beeping)
- (thud)
- (alarm beeping)
- Morgan... I know you're feeling down and I know you miss Sarah, but it's time to get out of bed.
- She's gone, man.
- Sarah's gone.
- Ellie: Out of bed, Chuck.
- You are getting Sarah back today.
- What? What?
- She doesn't remember me, okay?
- Or you or us or any of it.
- How many people are in my room right now?
- Dude... you can do this.
- You can get Sarah back.
- Even Clara agrees.
- Hi, Clara.
- Think about it.
- Every impossible mission starts with what?
- James Bond taking that giant step and getting out of bed.
- First of all, you're mixing your spy metaphors.
- Second, if you haven't noticed, I'm not exactly James Bond.
- I'm actually no longer a spy and I lost my wife.
- I'm back where I was before: alone in Burbank.
- You are not alone.
- You have us.
- And you are not the person you were five years ago.
- You are so much more. Yeah, there you go, big guy.
- One sit-up closer to getting the girl back.
- Guys, this is crazy, okay?
- I tried to get her to remember me and it didn't work.
- I can't get her to fall in love with me again.
- Chuck, it's clear that we can't force Sarah to remember-- but emotions, feelings, those are powerful things.
- And if you can find Sarah, maybe you can spark some of these memories.
- Really?
- She fell in love with you before, Chuck.
- You can do it again.
- She'll remember.
- Do you really think it could work?
- That she could just... snap out of it?
- Yeah, you know what?
- You're right.
- I-I... I-I can do this.
- I took down The Ring, FULCRUM, I'm a very impressive spy for hire.
- We fell in love once, we can do it again.
- She'll remember.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- That's the spirit.
- Wow, I just said that.
- I mean, she may be the best spy in the world, but I'm Chuck Bartowski.
- It's not like she's out of my league.
- I can do it.
- I can get Sarah Walker back.

Chuck Versus the Goodbye
Original Air Date on January 27, 2012
- Your target is Nicholas Quinn.
- I take it you don't want him alive.
- No, I want him very dead.
- Done.
- I'm ready to go.
- Are you?
- Carmichael Industries dropped the ball on this already.
- Five years in Burbank could turn a man into butter.
- But for this job, I need you ruthless.
- Anything less and you'll get k\*ll.
- I need Old Casey, my best agent.
- I need the Colonel.
- (quiet grunt)
- (phone buzzes)
- I can do it.
- Yeah, but look, it's not just about finding Sarah, it's about finding her and having a plan for what to do next.
- Chuck, this is your mission, okay?
- Find Sarah, be yourself.
- Be myself? Be myself?
- Okay, well... what version of myself?
- Lord of the Nerd Herd or charming Charles Carmichael?
- No, the guy that she fell for.
- Morgan: Yeah, I agree with that.
- Also, I have another notion.
- I think that you should kiss her.
- Did you...
- I'm sorry, what?
- Kiss her.
- Grab this woman and kiss her.
- Just kiss her.
- That's the whole plan?
- Yeah, pretty much. And, yes, I've been watching a ton of Disney princess movies with baby Clara, but...
- I firmly believe, with all my heart, that one magical kiss from you could unlock all of Sarah's memories. I do.
- Enough with the crazy.
- Captain: Exactly. We're wagging the dog here.
- Okay, we got to find Sarah first.
- But how do you find a woman who doesn't want to be found?
- (laughing maniacally)
- Can we find women?
- (laughing): Can we find women?
- Are you kidding me?
- We can find a woman off the discarded remnants of an Outback Bloomin' Onion.
- Unleash the perverts.
- Stalk, it's Gawk, I got your specs.
- Gawker, it's Stalker.
- We need a bead on a big, blonde bird, please.
- Gawker: Sounds like a job for the DirtDog.
- Up and hot, Gawk; I'll get a bead on your bird.
- Go Twinkie. Go Twinkie.
- My Twitter feed shows multiple reports...
- (all talking at once)
- Use the breadcrumbs, nab that Gretel.
- Sniff it out. Sniff it out. You got it.
- Lester: You heard him, use your sniffers.
- Tall blonde with amazing... falsely I.D. 'd as Uma Thurman... gorgeous profile...
- Follow that bird in flight.
- Thank you, Jeffery.
- Okay, Lester. Jeffery.
- Lester. Jeffery.
- What's happening here?
- She landed at LAX at 9:34 last night.
- She's en route to Burbank.
- In tight blue jeans and a cleavage-enhancing top.
- Meow.
- H-How do you know that?
- Man: Target spotted at an Internet cafe. Sh, sh, sh!
- Web history shows search for a Carmichael industries.
- Positive I.D. on one Sarah Walker in this Buy More, at the Nerd Herd Desk.
- I'm sorry... no nipslips nor pokey peaks.
- I'm sorry, wait, what?
- She's here now?
- Mm-hmm. No nipslips.
- (sighs)
- (exhales)
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi.
- I didn't know whether I should ring the bell.
- What are you, what are you, what are you doing here?
- I'm sorry, let me try that one again.
- It is really great to see you.
- It really, really, really is.
- You look fantastic.
- Of course, you always look fantastic.
- That's-that's-that's kind of your thing.
- So, with that, what are you doing here?
- Your spy base.
- Castle? Yeah?
- I need it.
- I lost track of Quinn, but I know what he wants.
- A device called The Key.
- An ex-FULCRUM agent had the first piece.
- And a former Ring operative, Renny Deutch, has the second.
- I, uh, read your profile, and you're good with computers?
- Yeah, I can... I can hack with the best of them.
- In fact, back in the day, they used to call me the...
- Doesn't-doesn't really matter, not important.
- You need me to find Renny? Done.
- Great. Thank you.
- Hey, there, stranger, aren't you...
- (groans, gasps)
- Hi, Sarah.
- (Morgan groans)
- Morgan. Hi.
- I'm-I'm sorry about that.
- No, no, it's-it's actually... it's... it's my fault.
- We've actually danced that dance before, and I should know...
- I should know better than to sneak up on you.
- (sighs)
- Can I help you?
- No, no, I just wanted to tell you that, um...
- There was a time I was Chuck's number one go-to best friend.
- And then you came along, and things changed.
- I just... if I was to hand the title off to anyone, I was always really happy it was you.
- I just wanted you to know that.
- Chuck: Found him.
- Renny Deutch.
- German arms dealer, sets up shop in Berlin.
- He's there now, so we find him, we find Quinn.
- All right, looks like I need a ticket to Berlin.
- Mm-hmm.
- (quietly): Go! You gotta be on this mission.
- Uh...
- Sarah-- hey-- quick, quick, uh, quick question before you go.
- Uh, what's your plan once you find Quinn?
- I k\*ll him.
- And then I...
- I disappear forever.
- Really? Really? Wow.
- Okay, well, then, my second question...
- I-I-I can't be here.
- I don't know how to be the woman that you remember me as.
- All I remember is being a spy-- a good one.
- It's all I know how to do.
- I understand that.
- I-I-I get that, but... I can help.
- If you go to Berlin alone, you're just going to get yourself k\*ll, but me and my team, we-we can...
- Yes, I'm small, but I'm worth three spies on a mission and I'm a very good listener.
- With us, you stand a chance.
- Look, you don't have the Intersect anymore, and you haven't been trained.
- am trained. I have been trained.
- You trained me. You were my handler.
- Okay.
- Do you know how to use this?
- Uh... (chuckles)
- Yeah, I can handle a Desert Eagle, 'cause I'm a stone-cold spy.
- That's me. I'm lethal.
- You'll need to be.
- Let's go.
- What if I have to use this thing?
- Morgan: Don't do that.
- Sarah fell in love with you-- in part-- for not sh\*\*ting people.
- Please remember that.
- Sarah: Okay, Renny just arrived.
- We need to follow him until he makes contact with Quinn, then we take them both out.
- Great. Cool. Sounds like a plan.
- Okay, let's go.
- Was that okay?
- Yeah. Do me a favor.
- Don't worry about anything. Be yourself, okay?
- Under no circumstances do you sh\*\*t anybody, no matter how dangerous it gets.
- (playing mariachi music)
- El Compadre. What?
- This place looks just like El Compadre.
- It's a... a Mexican restaurant in L.A.
- We went there when we first met.
- Buenas noches.
- (speaks German)
- Danke. Danke.
- MORGAN (over radio): Perfect, Chuck. This is fate.
- See? Maybe Sarah will remember something.
- Just use the old Chuck charm.
- So we're just going to follow these schmucks around?
- That's how we're going to find Quinn?
- Don't you sell Chuck and Sarah short.
- They're damn fine operatives.
- Yes, sir.
- (cell phone ringing)
- Sarah, this has got to be some kind of sign.
- I mean, think about it-- El Compadre was... sort of our first date.
- Not for you so much.
- You were still just, you know, being a spy back then, but for me, yeah, totally.
- I mean, I... somehow thought I stumbled on a date with the most beautiful woman in the world.
- I was so nervous.
- And you were so amazing.
- We talked and laughed and had such a great time.
- We went dancing afterwards, and you were doing these crazy, sexy dance moves.
- Chuck, stop.
- But it's our story.
- Don't you want to hear it?
- Chuck, we're on a mission, okay?
- The focus is Renny.
- Morgan: That's okay, buddy.
- If Sarah doesn't want to hear the story, then... then you just focus on tonight.
- You make this mish as romantic as you can.
- You make that girl fall in love with you all over again.
- You're right.
- No more stories.
- Let's focus on the op.
- Renny: The buyer's changing location.
- Cancel my enchiladas rancheros.
- We're leaving.
- The target's on the move.
- Chuck: Morgan, track where he's going.
- We may need a wardrobe change.
- ♪
- You look beautiful, by the way.
- Thank you.
- Your tie just needs a little fixing.
- You look great.
- Thanks.
- Morgan: Oh, Chuck, this is great.
- Russian Consulate mission, right?
- There'll be music and dancing and sexy outfits.
- Listen to me.
- You grab her, and you look in each other's eyes, and you kiss.
- And she'll remember the last five years, okay?
- I promise you. Now, you can do this!
- Sarah: Okay, I need to find somebody to dance with.
- I'm gonna get close to Renny...
- Sarah. Please.
- You taught me how to dance.
- ♪
- Get me close.
- To Renny.
- Close to Renny.
- Renny. Right.
- Our buyer's paranoid.
- He's changing the location again.
- We have to go.
- New location.
- Morgan, we're on the move again.
- (speaking German)
- Danke.
- (thudding)
- (sighs)
- This place is disgusting.
- (sighs)
- What? What is it?
- Nothing.
- Nothing at all.
- Attaboy, Chuck. Play it cool.
- Quinn must be running late.
- Looks like we have to do some waiting around.
- Sarah, what are you doing?
- They're in the wrong order.
- What?
- Well, that's not how it should be.
- You know this place?
- Uh...
- No. No, I don't.
- No, no, Sarah, it's-it's... it's okay.
- It's, actually, it's-it's important.
- You used to work here.
- I mean, not-not here in Berlin, but the Wienerlicious in Burbank.
- It was your first cover job.
- Come on, you can remember.
- Please. Please try.
- Quinn: Touching.
- (g\*n cocking)
- Quinn: Excuse me.
- Mr. Deutch, did you bring The Key?
- I did.
- It's going to cost you.
- Oh.
- The Ring spent a lot of money acquiring this.
- Danke schoen.
- Hey!
- I never liked The Ring.
- One more to go.
- Casey: I got more targets inside the Wienerlicious.
- Quinn's made his move.
- Let's get down there.
- This one was in a spy van across the street.
- Spy van?
- Really? It's that obvious?
- Drop your g\*n.
- (panting)
- It's Morgan.
- Oh, Sarah, you really don't remember, do you?
- Relax, boys; these two are mine.
- Your husband is one of the world's greatest...
- What's the word?
- Pussies.
- Aah!
- Chuck, stop him!
- (horns honking)
- (horns wailing, tires screech)
- Stop!
- Stop, Quinn!
- Stop!
- Don't! I will sh\*\*t you!
- Chuck!
- sh\*\*t him!
- I don't have a clean sh\*t.
- Sarah: Chuck, sh\*\*t him!
- Stop!
- (g\*n, panting)
- (helicopter whirring erratically)
- (alarm beeping)
- Hey, we're hit.
- Get us down!
- (car horn honking, tires squealing)
- Brace! Brace!
- (tires screeching)
- (panting)
- Hey.
- Is that my Desert Eagle?
- You sh\*t down my helicopter with my own damn g\*n!
- It was more of a warning sh\*t than anything else.
- Sorry, Casey.
- (emergency siren wailing)
- Dude, uncuff me!
- I want you to tell Alex something for me.
- Tell her I'm going away for a while.
- What the hell is going on here?
- Bartowski and Walker screwed up.
- So you arrest your own team?
- Old team.
- Sarah: You had him in your sights.
- All you had to do was pull the trigger.
- What do you want me to say?
- Your mistake cost us this mission.
- You let Quinn get one step closer to assembling The Key.
- Fine, I'll take the hit, but in my defense, k\*ll was never thing.
- You're a spy, aren't you?
- It was actually one of the things you liked about me-- the fact that I wouldn't pull the trigger.
- Tell me why you're not returning Alex's phone calls, okay?
- She is worried sick about you.
- All she knows is you're gone, running covert missions.
- They call 'em covert, numb nuts, because you don't tell anyone about them.
- She's your daughter!
- She's a liability.
- Wow.
- I don't mean that.
- Just, I have to be ruthless.
- Chuck: Well, at first, you thought I was weak or scared, and maybe I was.
- But you taught me how to be a spy, Sarah.
- And after we... you know...
- After we fell in love, you stood up for me.
- You didn't want me to be any other spy.
- You didn't want me to change.
- Morgan: What about Chuck and Sarah?
- Liability, too, right?
- Good. By all means, lock 'em up, throw away the key, lock away your feelings, too; forget everything that we've been through, and you be ruthless.
- You just don't understand, do you?
- I got soft.
- I lost my edge.
- Your team was your edge, you giant jackass!
- What is wrong with you, man?
- You want to find Quinn?
- You know who to call, but don't you dare try to blame this on us because you're afraid.
- That's right, you're afraid that, with us, that's when you're the best, and that's the truth, man.
- (low grunt)
- That's it?
- No response or anything?
- Screw it.
- Screw what, John?
- The court-martial.
- I'm in.
- What are you... ?
- I'm free?
- You, your wife, and my little roommate are going to help me track down Quinn.
- Walker.
- You're escaping without me?
- Look, I heard your pep talk.
- I think I'm better off hunting Quinn on my own.
- No, we're doing this together.
- I'm leaving.
- No, no, you're not.
- Why?
- Because of my mother.
- What?
- She's a spy.
- So?
- And she's standing right behind you with a g\*n.
- (g\*n cocks)
- Sarah.
- Relax.
- Chuck, I asked Mom to come...
- Mom, why is there a g\*n out?
- (sighs) Sorry, dear, old habits.
- It's good to see you again, Sarah.
- My name is Mary.
- Captain: Grandma, what did we say about Baby Clara seeing firearms?
- It's a no-no.
- I am sorry.
- Your Mimi loves you.
- Chuck, I have intel on The Key.
- Are you staying, Sarah?
- Your father originally developed the Intersect as a teaching tool.
- The Key was the matrix for programming the system.
- So it could do anything.
- Roark, Hartley, and Stephen split the pieces so that no one could alter the Intersect without their agreement.
- Your father gave his piece to someone in the government.
- If Quinn puts all three pieces together, he could fix the bug that blitzed Sarah and Morgan's memories and then upload it into himself.
- He could also add new k\*ll, new information.
- Chuck, we need to talk.
- What Mom is talking about down there is an Intersect that can create a new identity or restore an old one.
- Oh, my God, you're right.
- We could load Sarah's memories onto The Key.
- This could work.
- We create a file on Sarah, okay?
- Your wedding album, her dossier, everything.
- All you have to do is get the Intersect glasses back from Quinn.
- Okay? It's gonna take a few days, but I can reprogram them for Sarah.
- You just have to convince her it's the right thing to do.
- Sis, you're amazing. This is fantastic news.
- (phone rings)
- Ooh.
- Hey.
- Casey: Chuck.
- Quinn was spotted entering the Pacific Concert Hall.
- Beckman's there to meet with her Chinese counterpart.
- Your mother says Stephen gave The Key to someone in government.
- She's the target.
- Beckman has The Key.
- We found Quinn.
- He's at the Pacific Concert Hall.
- We gotta go.
- Pacific Concert Hall.
- They need us.
- Let's go.
- ♪
- Please sit still, General.
- The b\*mb is pressure sensitive.
- And if you don't mind, Diane... the badge of the person in charge of the Intersect Project.
- The designers gave it to you.
- What an honor.
- And all these years, you never knew it was the third part of The Key.
- (phone buzzes quietly)
- Hey, General, it's Chuck.
- We think you might be in danger.
- She's in more danger than you know, Chuck.
- It's over.
- I win.
- General, what have we got here?
- There is a b\*mb under my chair.
- I can't stand up.
- Morgan, get the Chinese delegation out of here.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Chuck: Mom, pull up the blueprints to the hall; we need to evacuate.
- Wait, guys, it looks like a sonic trigger, probably tied to the performance.
- When the music stops, it goes. Exactly.
- Get everybody out of here.
- Casey: No, no, no, no.
- We disrupt the performance, it'll blow up.
- That is an order.
- General, with all due respect, shut up.
- We're saving you.
- I've got something.
- Ooh.
- Well, if that's the b\*mb, these are the brains, and it's locked.
- Any ideas?
- No, not yet.
- Mary: Chuck, I just picked up Quinn on the internal security feed.
- He's heading to the roof.
- I'll get Quinn.
- Chuck, he has the Intersect glasses.
- Sarah.
- No, let her go.
- We don't have time.
- Well, get me more time, Casey, okay?
- I need Quinn to stop this b\*mb and I need those glasses for Sarah.
- Go, go.
- I'm ready for extraction.
- Pilot: We're on our way, sir. Three minutes.
- Morgan. Yeah.
- We gotta keep the music going.
- We can't let it stop.
- What are we going to do?
- Jeff: Casey, Morgan.
- Okay, we're here.
- Who do we sh\*\*t first?
- What are they doing here?
- Okay, hold on a second, hold on a second, Casey.
- I got a plan.
- You're not going to like it, but I got a plan.
- (g\*n cocks)
- Quinn!
- Chuck: Sarah!
- W-W-W-Wait, wait.
- Don't k\*ll him.
- We need him to disarm the b\*mb.
- The b\*mb?
- (laughs)
- It can't be stopped.
- And it's wired to explode when the music ends.
- Which is right about... now.

- I understand this is the end.
- Yes, it is, General.
- I think we... It's me.
- I, um...
- I need to go find myself.
- We all do.
- If you ever want to save the world again, you know where I am.
- So, here we are.

- (low grunt) Gotta go.
- What? Wait, really?
- Really?
- I can smell it coming.
- You're gonna get weepy and emotional.
- I'll just skip that part.
- I'll see you when I see you, Bartowski, huh?
- Good-bye, Casey.
- (grunts)
- There's one thing Russians do well-- it's give good hugs.
- Walker.
- Colonel.
- So, Irene Demova...
- I, um...
- (sighs) I'm not really sure what it meant.
- Or maybe it's a fresh start, a new beginning.
- I need some time to think.
- To be alone.
- I'm sorry.
- You know, Morgan had this idea.
- It's nutty, really.
- That if we...
- You have to go; I understand.
- So the moment the music stopped, the b\*mb would blow up.
- So, Chuck calls us.
- So we could save the day.
- So Jeffster! could rock again!
- So what you're saying is Chuck Bartowski is a spy who runs a spy company underneath the store.
- The exciting part of the story is that we saved the day.
- You didn't get that? We'll go again.
- I got it.
- But do I believe it?
- Not a word, boys.
- Not a word.
- Things, though, are a-changin'.
- (sighs)
- New owners moving in.
- Yep. Looking fresh.
- I'm gonna be eating fresh.
- We gotta get back to work.
- German Man: Excuse me.
- Are you Scheffester!?
- I saw your performance last night at the Pacific Concert Hall.
- I'm a very important record executive from Germany.
- You're gonna be stars there.
- Women and men will adore you.
- Women and men?
- Wait... wait a minute.
- You want us to leave this store?
- Yes. Right now.
- Come with me.

- Are you ready?
- Let's rock.
- Wunderbar. Come on.
- What's the big surprise?
- You two moving in together?
- Both: We're moving in together!
- It's not fun with you.
- It was supposed to be a surprise.
- How did you know?
- Hello? Spy.
- And you're...
- Happy that we're finally taking this nice, giant step and... ?
- Or you're going to sh\*\*t me?
- Heads up.
- The place all is yours.
- We're all going to live together?
- No, just the two of you.
- I have, uh... someplace I need to be.
- You're going after Gertrude.
- I was going to ask you.
- Dad, you don't have to ask.
- You deserve to be happy.
- Go.
- Run to her. Run to her.
- I'm a Casey; I don't run.
- I stalk my prey.
- Oh, my precious Clara.
- You are going to love Chicago.
- And Mimi is gonna come and see you all the time.
- (sighs)
- I don't know how I'm supposed to leave you like this.
- Ellie, you have to.
- You've taken care of me for far too long.
- You have Clara and Devon.
- I'm fine.
- I'm all grown up now.
- My little brother.
- Aces, Charles.
- You're aces.
- What about Sarah, Chuck?
- (sighs)
- I don't know.
- Morgan, she could be anywhere.
- Okay, you know where she is.
- You told me to listen to our hearts, because our brains only screw us up.
- I was in love then.
- You're still in love.
- I want you to imagine something for me, okay?
- Where is she right now?
- Don't think.
- Use your heart.
- Where is she?
- I was hoping you'd be here.
- This place is important, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah, very much.
- This is actually where you told me I was going to be okay.
- That I could trust you.
- And that's exactly what I'm doing now.
- I'm asking you to trust me.
- Sarah, I don't... I don't want anything from you.
- I-I just need you to know that wherever you go, I'll always be there to help you.
- Someone you can call.
- Whenever.
- Trust me, Sarah.
- I'm here for you always.
- Chuck?
- Tell me our story.
- Yeah, yeah, uh...
- Where to begin?
- Well, uh, it started with a guy who worked at Buy More.
- And then, one day, an old college friend of his sent him an e-mail that was filled with secrets.
- And then, the next day, his life really changed when he met a spy named Sarah, and he fell in love.
