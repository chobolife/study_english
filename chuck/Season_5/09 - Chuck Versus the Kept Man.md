# Chuck Versus the Kept Man

- Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know.
- Come on. Carmichael Industries. The independence and freedom to do what we want when we want.
- I had no idea I had such strong feelings for him.
- I have to disappear for a while.
- All members of Carmichael Industries have a position open to them at the CIA.
- If we go back, it's just gonna be missions and secrets.
- I don't want to go back.
- Okay.
- All we need is each other.
- So, Mr. Carmichael, tell me, how do you feel like dying today?
- Honestly? You're gonna make me decide?
- I find it says a lot about a man.
- I-I, you know, I don't know.
- Can't you just pick something?
- I've got a lot on my plate right now.
- Like what?
- Running your own company.
- It's just, you know, there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that.
- Not that I don't care about recovering spent nuclear fuel rods, 'cause I do, but you got to keep your eye the bottom line.
- And with missions, the bottom line is cash, man.
- You know, with all these private security firms out there, I-I think maybe I'm coming at this the wrong way.
- Maybe Carmichael Industries needs a new hook, you know?
- Sarah: Almost there, Chuck.
- You're very good at talking.
- Exactly.
- Any spy can sneak into a building and-and snap a few necks.
- But what are we doing right here, right now, the two of us?
- We're talking about our hopes and our dreams.
- So you're spies that care?
- You're a genius. That's inspired. I'm gonna use that. Can I use that?
- I'm glad I could help you, Mr. Carmichael, but I think I'll start by cutting out your tongue.
- That would be a horrible idea.
- I would not want to do that.
- Especially with such a blunt object.
- Stop it, baldy!
- Oh, my God.
- Chuck, are you okay?
- I think we just had a breakthrough, honey.
- Do you think it's okay to touch that without a radiation suit?
- Shouldn't be any worse than a couple dozen X-rays.
- We'll be fine, as long as no one's pregnant.
- (laughs)
- (chuckles) Okay, Casey, I'm gonna let you take that. Let's go.
- Don't tell me you're getting sentimental.
- "Welcome back, Gertrude. "
- "Good to see you, Gertrude. "
- "I missed you, Gertrude. "
- Just nod your head if you agree with any of this.
- Didn't hear you come in.
- That's because I took off my heels.
- Among other things.
- I guess you heard you're not wanted for m*rder anymore.
- Beckman put a lid on that whole Decker thing.
- Turns out, he was just a patsy, just...
- I didn't fly halfway across the world to be debriefed.
- Uh-uh.
- That's your job, John.
- Mm...
- I thought you said you were coming to bed.
- Have you been up all night long?
- That bad guy got me thinking.
- The one who tried to cut your tongue out?
- Our mission statement, our mission statement.
- We spend so much time focusing on spy missions, that we've lost sight of the-the, you know, uh, "what are we doing, why are we here" mission.
- Are you feeling okay?
- I think that pizza that Morgan left in the fridge is starting to turn.
- I have never thought more clearly in my life.
- Oh, "the things we feel but do not share. "
- What can we, Carmichael Industries, offer our clients that other security firms can't? Go.
- Discount electronics?
- We care, Sarah.
- We care.
- C-A-R-E.
- Clandestine Agents Relating Emotionally.
- Get it?
- (groans) You hate it.
- No, I think it's very interesting.
- I just, uh, I just feel very queasy suddenly.
- Huh.
- Maybe the pizza was bad.
- Who told you you could get dressed?
- It's a work day, remember?
- First of all, I have something for you.
- Hmm?
- Open it.
- It's a... sweater.
- Why's it so soft?
- It's cashmere.
- Doesn't feel flame-retardant.
- It's the perfect weight for a winter night in South Beach.
- What's in South Beach?
- The second part of your surprise.
- You and I are going to Miami for three nights at the Maya.
- In the middle of the week?
- I can't just take off and sun my buns in Miami.
- No, no, no.
- I have a job.
- Two, technically.
- Right, right.
- I get it.
- I'll, uh, call you later.
- Okay.
- Good.
- Hey.
- Don't forget your new sweater.
- Why are we looking at surveillance footage from this morning?
- I don't know... yet.
- Ever since I got my brain cleaned, I've had this suspicion that something's happening behind the scenes here.
- Wait a minute.
- Is that... ?
- Bingo.
- John Casey wearing a deep V-neck cashmere sweater.
- Who are you, John Casey?
- And what's he doing sneaking around the Buy More hours before his shift starts?
- Maybe he's here to meet somebody.
- Jeff: Those two.
- Of course they're in on it.
- In on what? They're probably just doing it in the home theater room like I do.
- Not likely.
- I'm gonna need some three-by-five cards, stat.
- Okay.
- Stat!
- Ooh!
- I got to say, I'm grooving on that deep V, Casey.
- What do you got here?
- "Clandestine Agents Relating Emotionally. "
- (snaps fingers) CARE?
- Mm-hmm.
- You really think this is what our clients want, private security firm that holds their hands, builds their self-esteem, tells them they're special?
- Isn't that what everyone wants, Casey?
- And it's no coincidence that we booked our first client in forever, hours after I put my CARE statement on our Web site.
- We have a Web site?
- Who's the client?
- Hey.
- I told you I was working.
- So am I.
- You're the cl-- She's the client?
- May I remind you that you have your own personal security firm.
- My personnel are stretched a bit thin.
- Besides, your company offers a level of service that other companies just don't offer.
- You care.
- (mouthing)
- And I intend to take full advantage of that.
- See? Mission statement working already.

- Rocky Falcone, cologne wearing scumbag He's m*rder his way into becoming one of the biggest arms dealers in Miami.
- We have some business that he insists on conducting face-to-face.
- You'll act as protection.
- Where's the meet?
- Miami.
- Mm, what a coincidence.
- Is it okay if I make the retainer fee payable to Carmichael Industries? Sure.
- Actually, I'm gonna pay the whole fee right up front.
- We haven't said yes to running...
- Yes. Yes.
- Meet you on the runway bright and early.
- That way, we can catch some pool time.
- Chuck: Sounds good.
- See you in the a. m.
- What is your problem?
- Yeah, seriously, what is your problem?
- That was not very caring, Casey.
- An above-board arms deal in Miami?
- Sounds like a vacation.
- Haven't you had enough kidnapping, torture and bloodshed?
- Chuck: Besides, we haven't made a cent in months, and your girlfriend has deep pockets.
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Whatever you want to call her, she's our new client.
- Pack your bags, lover boy.
- We're going to South Beach.
- Are you going out of town?
- Yeah, something came up.
- I have to leave for a couple days.
- Movie night.
- It's okay, we'll do it next week.
- And don't worry, I have already chosen what we'll watch.
- "Downton Abbey. worry, I have already chosen An upstairs/downstairs costume drama in early 1900s England. "
- Yeah, something tells me, not gonna be a lot of explosions in that one. Are you kidding?
- What about the b*mb they drop on Edwardian convention?
- (scoffs)
- Uh, listen, I-I-- yeah.
- It's okay, you don't have to explain.
- You're my hero.
- Please pardon the speculative nature of my research.
- This is just the first stab at what I think our coworkers are really up to.
- Okay.
- Obviously, some of my deductions are quite tenuous, but if you'll bear with me for just a moment...
- You think they're spies?
- Casey and Sarah?
- Yes. Probably NSA or CIA.
- Chuck is some kind of asset.
- The only thing left to figure out is this.
- There's a fourth member of their team.
- He's their secret w*apon.
- What are you guys doing?
- He's seen too much. Grab him!
- Morgan: Guys! Guys, guys, guys, guys.
- Jeff: You see how he slipped out like that?
- Maybe he's our mystery agent.
- (scoffs)
- Wait, wait, easy. Easy there, Jeffrey.
- I was with you on the whole conspiracy theory thing, but seriously, this loser, a spy?
- I mean, come on. Come on. Yeah, I mean, come on.
- Either way, he's gonna tell Chuck we're on to him.
- Fine. We'll k*ll him.
- What? No. Guys, I'm not gonna tell Chuck squat, all right?
- I've been conducting my own investigation, and you guys are absolutely right.
- You nailed it, all right?
- There is a mystery agent. I've tracked him down.
- And, uh, I got him.
- You... are you, uh... you're gonna... this is gonna blow your mind.
- You're gonna be, like, "What? There's no way he's, you know. "
- But boom, there he is, all right?
- If that's not James Bond, I don't know what is, right? Of course.
- ♪
- Hello, darling.
- Oh, garcon, another daiquiri for me. And you?
- Just another sparkling water, please.
- You heard the lady.
- And you can put that on Ms. Verbanski's room.
- Thank you very much.
- CASEY (over comm): Chuck, Sarah, stay focused on the mission.
- Gertrude, you have a bogey closing from your 9:00.
- Walker, you have a positive I.D. ?
- That's a negative on Falcone, but there could be another one of his heavies.
- Your call, Casey.
- I'll handle it.
- Package for Ms. Verbanski...
- Whoa!
- Thank you.
- A little jumpy, John?
- I thought he was one of Falcone's men. Didn't know what he had.
- It's a little something that I found for you in the lobby.
- What the hell is it?
- It's a swimsuit, John.
- Your job is to blend in around here, and I'd like you to put it on, please.
- Change room right there.
- Oh, God.
- You know, look, I mean, honestly, Falcone is not gonna be showing his face down here.
- You wanna go take a little dip in the hot tub with me?
- No. No, I don't think that's a good idea.
- No booze, no Jacuzz, what's gotten into my wife?
- Look, why don't you just stay put and take care of the client?
- I'm gonna go check on Casey, okay?
- Casey.
- (hushed): Just a minute!
- Oh, God, I'm coming in.
- I can't do it, Walker.
- Sometimes Gertrude, she doesn't even listen to what I'm trying to tell her.
- I can sympathize.
- Thank you.
- But you're putting on that bathing suit.
- Like hell.
- This is a dream mission, Casey, and I'm not gonna let you screw it up.
- Do you how many skimpy outfits I have had to put on for this team?
- Did you hear me complain when I had to put on a cat suit or seven-inch platform high heels or a belly dancing outfit?
- Belly dancing?
- Okay, that was private.
- Look, just put on the banana hammock and stop whining.
- You okay, Walker?
- You seem a little emotional these days.
- Shut up.
- Guys, I lost Verbanski.
- What? What do you mean, you lost Verbanski?
- Falcone musta scoped our Mickey Mouse security.
- Verbanski? Verbanski?
- She's not responding on comms.
- Her signal is still transmitting.
- I'm showing her at the far west corner of the hotel.
- Verbanski: Casey, I need your help!
- We're coming in.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Falcone must be holding her in the Presidential Suite.
- (door opens)
- Where's Falcone?
- We're meeting him for dinner, John.
- In the meantime, I suggest we work up an appetite.
- I'll show you what's under mine if you show me what's under yours.
- You've been a naughty, naughty colonel.
- What is it?
- Sarah, what's wrong?
- Everything.
- It's all wrong.
- (Casey sighs)
- Well, very smart, Ms. Verbanski: meeting in public, bringing your own security team.
- It's like you don't trust me. (chuckles)
- (chuckles)
- (g*n cocks) Easy, Casey.
- This is my price.
- And this is mine... provided the merchandise meets my specs.
- Some woman, your boss.
- I have a private w*apon range.
- Meet me there at midnight.
- And don't forget your checkbook.
- Are you seriously considering going to an unsecured location?
- John, I want those g*n.
- And when I want something...
- Any... (clears throat) Anyhoo, I'd like to, uh, on behalf of our team, propose a toast to you because honestly, kudos. I like how you do business.
- Know what I mean?
- This op is top-shelf.
- Well, you know, at Verbanski Corp we have a work hard, play hard philosophy.
- Here's to playing harder.
- Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.
- Don't worry. I got this. I got this.
- Put it on your tab, Mr. Verbanski?
- Mind if I give you a little advice?
- If you use the word "care, "
- I'm gonna take this glass, shove it down your throat and punch you in the stomach so it shatters, hmm?
- Okay. It's not spy advice.
- It's actually relationship advice.
- She doesn't want a relationship.
- She wants a lackey, a lapdog, a beefcake.
- What is Verbanski really trying to tell you, John, huh?
- Because even tough women like Gertrude and Sarah, they're constantly giving out these secret signals that you need to be sensitive to.
- I know we spend so much time sharpening our spy senses that we forget to use this, this guy, the heart.
- You know what I'm talking about.
- And you need to learn how to listen with your heart.
- Come on. I'll show you how it's done.
- Are you all ready to order?
- Oh, uh, I think I might need a couple extra minutes.
- Mmm, you just kind of... gonna have to listen to her, listen to her, okay?
- I know what she wants before she knows what she wants.
- Observe.
- Actually, I'd love to order for my lady.
- If you don't mind, hon.
- I think to wet her whistle, she'll start with a glass of your Barolo.
- I'm so wrong. We're on vacation.
- Vodka martini up.
- Thank you very much.
- Entree: bone-in rib eye extra rare, I'm talking blue or as blue as you can find. as in mooing on the plate. (moos)
- That's bad-- I don't do a good cow. (chuckles)
- She's like a book, and I'm an emotional speed-reader, my friend.
- What's going on, bro?
- Devon, you have been targeted.
- Targeted? What? Who?
- Jeff and Lester.
- They think that you're some sort of international super spy.
- (chuckles) Those idiots? Why?
- Because I told 'em.
- Maybe it's because Jeff is no longer an idiot, I don't know.
- But those two stumbled upon our actual spy operation.
- You see?
- Gotcha. You need me to throw 'em off the scent.
- Hey... now you're thinking like a spy.
- Here's the key question: Can you act like one?
- Can I go formal?
- I've secured the U-238.
- This device will make you more powerful than you ever dreamed.
- Location forthcoming.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Are you sure you don't want us to do a little recon before it's too late?
- It's not my first arms deal.
- I'm good for my half.
- And you?
- Ms. Verbanski, do you always dress your security this well?
- Looks soft.
- Just show us the g*n, huh?
- Yeah.
- I present to you... the Aegis.
- Please, have a try.
- Casey, don't we need ear protection or something?
- Huh, not bad.
- Not bad.
- Verbanski Corp will take full delivery.
- Three million dollars.
- No deal.
- Actually, I'll take your money.
- But you can leave me your g*n.
- (g*n cocking)
- Casey, why aren't they dead?
- Rocky: What your boss didn't tell you, is that the Aegis has a safety feature.
- Each g*n can be coded so that it can't be fired at someone carrying an Aegis with the same code.
- It's a way of preventing friendly fire.
- (laughing)
- Ingenious, no?
- Quite.
- Except my team's w*apon don't have that safety feature.
- And it would be a shame if someone got sh*t.
- The price just changed, Rock. How does free grab you?
- Okay, would someone like to please explain to me what the heck is going on?
- So this was your plan all along. We were the loser team you hired so Rocky'd think you were vulnerable.
- Nice. No. I still need you, John.
- Rocky is just the first piece of the puzzle.
- The real mission starts now.
- I'm out.
- Casey, wait.
- Whoa, hey... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Team meeting, team meeting.
- Casey, you can't just walk away.
- If you quit now, we'll be lucky to see the retainer.
- Besides, what did we talk about at the restaurant, huh?
- What did we talk about?
- Are you using this?
- I think you owe it to our client.
- Listen to her signals. What is she really telling you?
- You think I need to be more sensitive?
- More in tune with my girlfriend's emotions, hmm?
- You're one to talk.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you've got your head so far up your new CARE manifesto you don't even realize your own wife thinks she's pregnant and is hiding it from you.
- What are you crazy? There's no way...
- There's no way she could be pregnant.
- I'd have to be the most clueless, insensitive, uncaring...
- Uh, Chuck...
- Sarah, I'm sorry. I didn't exactly pick up on your signals.
- No, I'm sorry. I should have just told you.
- It just felt like if I said it out loud, it would suddenly become real.
- It's changing, it's changing, it's changing.
- What is that-- an equal sign, an arrow?
- A peace sign? Is that an option?
- Um...
- Uh, okay, that means no.
- I'm not pregnant.
- Okay, all right.
- And you feel... ?
- Strange.
- Maybe a little relieved.
- Same.
- Same.
- But this whole thing has gotten me thinking about our lives, our future. Chuck...
- I mean, honestly, Sarah, is the spy lifestyle really where we want to be raising our kids, you know, putting ourselves in danger every day?
- Chuck... Yeah?
- You're spiraling.
- Mm-hmm.
- I need you back in immediately.
- I was telling Casey the truth.
- I leveraged Rocky Falcone to give up his supplier.
- Pedro St. Germain is notorious.
- All g*n and narcotics that come up from the South flow through him. He has an enormous FBI bounty on his head if I'm not mistaken.
- And that's where the real mission comes in.
- The FBI hired me to find St. Germain.
- And Falcone kindly gave up his exact location in the Everglades.
- We're in. We'll be in Miami by nightfall.
- Actually, honey, I think we should discuss this.
- Discuss what?
- I don't think it's safe for prospective parents to be in a situation like this.
- I've been toying with cutting back on the grunt work.
- That's cute. I just figured you'd want to finish the mission you started and take some of the proceeds...
- Un momento.  I was just saying maybe we should talk about... And she hung up.
- Chuck, stop spiraling.
- I'm-I'm not spiraling. You're spiraling.
- Ooh, yeah, cashmere, nice.
- Do you mind? I have a tailor who can make me two sweaters out of this bad boy.
- Rough mission?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Okay, that's no problem. Tons to talk about.
- Lot of stuff going on at the Buy More.
- Verbanski wasn't bringing me a mission.
- It was an all-expenses-paid vacation.
- Sun, sand, sex.
- The nerve of that woman.
- I'm not a kept man. I'm a spy, damn it.
- Don't I know it.
- Trust me.
- In fact, I might have a little spy work for you.
- What kind of spy work do you have?
- Hmm.
- I'm making the drop now.
- I have my eyes on the drop spot.
- Ten-four. Let's go.
- Okay. It's oddly comfortable running in heels.
- Perfect. Come on.
- Just so you know, I'm keeping these shoes.
- Calm down, Jeff.
- We strike from the east entrance.
- Take St. Germain alive.
- Figured it was only a matter of time before that rat Falcone sold me out.
- You waving that g*n around for show or are you going to use it?
- (laughing)
- (cell phone ringtone)
- Yeah? I take it this is an apology.
- I got your girlfriend, so you might want to listen up.
- (sighs)
- You got her all tied up, do you?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, she is.
- Uh-huh. And she needs her big, strong boyfriend to come rescue her, right?
- Again, correct.
- And bring $10 million cash.
- That's a nice detail.
- Look, you tell Verbanski she fooled me once-- she's not going to fool me again, got it?
- She said you'd be playing hardball.
- Don't pay him anything, Casey!
- I can handle it myself!
- Didn't I tell you to shut up? !
- Gertrude? Gertrude?
- So $10 million by tonight or she dies.
- Okay.
- 10 mil to go.
- Think they'll check to see if it's counterfeit?
- Oh, I'm pretty sure they will. If all goes according to plan, they're not going to be in any condition to check anything.
- Undetectable if the case is searched.
- Walker, when I say the code word "CARE, " you start picking off the guards so I can get to my w*apon.
- And my job would be?
- You're getaway driver.
- Trust me, Chuck, you don't want to have anything to do with this.
- It's going to be a bloodbath in there.
- You just be ready for extraction when the time comes.
- Okay, let's do it. Oh, hey, Walker, listen.
- You sure you're not, uh... ?
- I'm not pregnant.
- Okay.
- Because this is going to be dangerous... I know.
- I get how dangerous it is. Let's go.
- Stop. I'm unarmed.
- I'm here for a trade with St. Germain.
- There's a guy here who says he wants to make a trade with St. Germain.
- Copy that.
- What if we had a baby at home?
- Excuse me?
- What if we had a baby relying on us to come home, and something happened?
- Something? Something, anything.
- I don't know, we didn't come home.
- Who would raise the kids?
- What-what would happen then?
- Honey, we don't have a baby, let alone babies plural.
- Not now, but we will.
- Maybe you're right-- spying and parenting just don't go together.
- Sarah, you're spiraling, okay?
- Take a deep breath.
- Everything's going to be fine, I promise.
- Okay.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- We need to split up.
- Your knight in shining armor has arrived.
- Let's see what you brought me.
- I'm almost to the compound, Casey.
- (twig crunches)
- (grunting)
- Ah!
- Chuck: Sarah! I'm coming!
- (grunts)
- Ah... Sarah, are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
- It was just a flash grenade. But I-I can't see.
- I could've handled this myself.
- I couldn't leave you out here in the swamp.
- Because I care.
- Okay, that's Casey. You've got to go.
- Are you crazy? I'm not going to leave you here alone. No. I'll be fine in a minute.
- Please, just take my g*n in case something goes wrong, okay?
- I'm not gonna need it, I have the AEGIS.
- I love you.
- Be safe, okay?
- I said, I care.
- Ah, maybe I care too much.
- (sighs)
- I've been working so hard on my spy senses, too.
- My eyes, my ears, my fists...
- What I should've been working on is this.
- John, stop. Stop.
- Please stop.
- No, I can't, Gertrude... because I love you.
- And I need you to know how much I care.
- I care a lot.
- I don't know who you're trying to signal, man, but it all stops right now.
- Sorry I'm late.
- I've got the Aegis. They can't hit us.
- We need to get to cover!
- I am the cover!
- Move, move, move! Ah, ah...
- Move!
- I heard your speech!
- It's great that you're opening up your heart like that!
- Yeah.
- Move, move!
- ST. GERMAIN: Good show!
- Very entertaining.
- But g*n don't have safeties.
- Don't worry. I wore my seatbelt.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, I'm just doing some thinking.
- Uh...
- I have a small confession to make: part of me was kind of hoping that I was pregnant.
- I've thought a lot about that, too.
- And... yeah, I think it'd be kind of exciting.
- I mean, it's not like I want a baby right this second, but it's not the worst idea in the world.
- No. No, it's not.
- Listen to us, talking about kids, and a house, and a real family.
- Did you think we'd ever be talking about stuff like this?
- Nope.
- Especially not with such a huge nerd.
- Ah ha ha...
- ♪
- Thought we were past this.
- Just open it.
- Stops anything this side of a . 30-06.
- I saw you eyeing that guard's vest in Miami.
- Look, I'm...
- I'm sorry for dragging you on a glorified vacation.
- I... I guess it was just my misguided way of saying that I... want to be close to you.
- Thanks.
- I feel the same.
- I know Miami wasn't really your scene.
- But my next mission is in a much better place.
- Dresden. Ah... Dresden.
- Harsh, cold.
- Come with me. Two months, real danger.
- Who knows? We could both get sh*t.
- You know I'd love to.
- But, um, two months is a long time to be away from here.
- Mm, well... when you're ready, I'll be there.
- Unless, of course, you have another woman behind the scenes.
- No.
- Not exactly.
- So, I have this friend.
- She's out of town right now, but I'd like... for you to meet her sometime.
- "Friend"?
- Like a girlfriend?
- Nah... not like a girlfriend.
- Okay.
- Yeah, actually, like a girlfriend.
- Well, I would, uh... love to meet her.
- Perfect.
- Oh, no. What?
- The housemaid is laying out coffee spoons with the dinner service.
- There is going to be hell to pay at Downton Abbey tonight.
- So...
- Devon Woodcomb-- who, last time I checked, was an extremely handsome medical doctor-- and you think he's building a nuclear b*mb?
- We know the location of the b*mb.
- We don't just think it; we know it!
- Voilà!
- That's a Outback coupon.
- So it is.
- Voilà!
- Come with us.
- Let's blow this thing wide open.
- Yeah, fine.
- I've only walked . 53 miles today.
- Another few steps wouldn't hurt me.
- You, sir, are an American hero.
- He's up to something.
- What on earth?
- After we open this door, there's no going back.
- Let's do this.
- I'm still at 1, 500 steps.
- Oh, careful, careful. Careful.
- (Lester clears throat)
- Ahem.
- What are you guys doing here? How'd you find this place?
- Uh, the better question is, what are you doing here?
- Really, what are you doing here? I'm-I'm confused.
- Ellie doesn't like my workout equipment around the house, so...
- I figured this would be perfect.
- Chuck told me about this abandoned basement.
- But... the U238.
- It was being delivered here.
- You mean this?
- About to make my biceps go nuclear.
- Then why all the secrecy?
- Well, some of these exercise techniques aren't exactly... legal... in the US.
- If you catch my drift.
- Are you two happy?
- Let the statuesque man work out in peace.
- Is that a pedometer?
- Got a whole box of them upstairs.
- (whistles) Sweet.
- Big Mike: I'll work you out a deal.
- Captain: Yeah, we got to work out sometime, Big Mike.
- I like your style.
- Big Mike: Do a lot of working out.
- It's too easy.
- (spluttering)
- Well...
- The whole search... worthless.
- There's no spies, no secret base.
- Nothing.
- Ah, Jeffrey, you know... maybe this wasn't a search for a secret spy base.
- Maybe this was a search for friendship.
- How do you mean?
- I don't know.
- I just wanted to say something to cheer you up.
- Would you just come here?
- Okay, buddy? Okay?
- All right, let's get out of here.
- Thank you. This place reeks.
- What the... ?
- It's still wet.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.
- Remember when I was at Pine Ridge?
- The, uh, mental institution? Yeah.
- It was so dreary, they'd actually put fake backdrops in the windows.
- That's pretty cruel.
- I always knew it was fake.
- Um, where are we going with this, buddy?
- I guess what I'm trying to say is... it's not always easy to trick a mental patient.
- Jeff: I knew it!
- We were right!
- Lester...
- Jeffrey!
- Oh... crap.
- I mean, we got a problem. Yeah, yeah, I'd call it that.
