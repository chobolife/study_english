# Chuck Versus Sarah

- Hi, I'm Chuck. And here's what's been going on in my life, lately.
- You wouldn't have downloaded the same version Morgan had, would you? Oh...
- Chuck: I know you lose memories when you flash.
- (beeping)
- No!
- Whoa, Sarah.
- Who are you?
- Your handler.
- Orders are in.
- k\*ll Chuck Bartowski.
- Okay, guys, Sarah's out there.
- She's still out there; we need to find her.
- Quinn said that he's after the last remaining intersect, which means if we find it, we will probably find Quinn, and with him... Sarah.
- Exactly.
- Which is why I hacked into the CIA's database.
- Just stay with me for a little bit, because I found something interesting.
- These are the blueprints to DARPA.
- DARPA? That's an acronym for something.
- Give me a minute, I can figure it out.
- Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
- Morgan, if the CIA had a Q working for them, he'd be working right there.
- And I've seen enough Intersect white rooms to know that they have one.
- Guys, I know this is a long sh\*t, But I have to do something to find her.
- I cannot continue to sit idly by and wait.
- Are you with me?
- Let's go. 100%.
- Sarah?
- I'm... I'm sorry it took me so long to come home.
- Baby... but you've been undercover for the past five years, monitoring a rogue spy.
- His name is Chuck Bartowski.
- Everything's in here.
- Strengths, weaknesses, profiles of the people closest to him.
- Memorize it.
- Any questions?
- Yeah. Yeah, just one, um...
- Why the hell should I believe you?
- (grunting)
- I'm on your side, Agent Walker.
- I don't want to have to hurt you.
- And then I threw him out the window.
- And that's how I escaped.
- What? I can't believe that.
- That's nuts, amazing.
- And Quinn?
- He's dead.
- And the Intersect is out of my head.
- So, it's all over. Well, thankfully, these cuts look pretty minor.
- We should let you get some rest.
- QUINN (over comms): Eleanor Bartowski.
- The sister.
- Goes by Ellie.
- Thank you, Ellie.
- And you remember her husband's name.
- And thank you, Devon.
- Thank you, all of you.
- I'm-I'm really glad to be home.
- Glad you're safe.
- Me, too.
- (grunting)
- I don't remember you any more than I remember this Bartowski guy.
- So you tell me, what happened to me?
- (choking): Walker, give me a chance.
- There's something you need to see.
- (beep)
- This is Agent Sarah Walker.
- Today is September 24, 2007, Day One.
- Today, I made contact with the Intersect, Charles Irving Bartowski, or rather, Chuck.
- My mission is simple: find out what he knows, gain his trust and monitor his actions until the agency can decide what to do with him.
- (beep) Well, the Agency has made a decision, Agent Walker.
- (hammer clicks)
- Chuck Bartowski has proven to be a major threat to... (clears throat) national security.
- Well, then put Director Graham on the phone.
- He gives me my orders.
- He's dead, Sarah.
- Well, what about my partner, Bryce?
- Where is he?
- I'm sorry, Sarah.
- He's dead, too.
- That's not possible.
- We believe that Bartowski and his team are responsible for both of their deaths.
- And I wish I could just let you forget everything horrible that this man has done, but Chuck Bartowski needs to be stopped.
- He's a traitor.
- And you want me to k\*ll him?
- Yes.
- But first, I need you to retrieve something that he's stolen from us.
- A pair of Intersect glasses.
- We believe that Chuck wants to use them to upload a pristine version of the Intersect.
- Sarah?
- If you want your life back-- the life he stole from you-- return to Burbank, retrieve the glasses, and put Chuck Bartowski to rest once and for all.
- I'm so glad you're okay.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

- (whimpers)
- (Butcher's kn\*fe pounds)
- Wow, you are...
- You are really going to town on that thing, huh?
- I'm just cutting the chicken up.
- You're just getting it...
- I'm gonna... I'm gonna make a quick phone call, okay?
- Love you. Be right back.
- (bones crunching)
- (door closes) I'm alone.
- Good.
- Find the glasses.
- (over comms): Look for a hidden safe or vault.
- Be careful, Walker.
- Do not underestimate him.
- He has proven time and again that he is more dangerous than he looks, and remember, the rest of his team is only a few feet away.
- MORGAN (over phone): Different how?
- I don't know, Morgan; that's what I'm trying to tell you.
- I can't put my finger on it.
- Sarah just seems different.
- Look, of course she's not acting like herself.
- Okay, she was kidnapped by some homicidal maniac on a Japanese b\*llet train, and then in order to escape, she had to k\*ll the dude and walk home from his secret base barefoot!
- Wow, she really is incredible, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, maybe you're right, maybe you're right.
- Maybe I just need to try and make her feel, you know, a little more relaxed.
- Yes, yes, untense the tense girl.
- Loosen up that leggy blonde.
- I can do that.
- Hey, uh... that leggy blonde.
- Hey, honey, uh, you want to meet me in the bedroom?
- I have a surprise for you. Okay.
- Okay.
- I think he's up to something.
- QUINN (over comms): Stay alert.
- It could be a trap.
- (door squeaks open)
- Welcome to the Bartowski Inn and Spa Resort where all of your worries melt away.
- You have to use a little imagination, but picture, if you will, outside those windows the gorgeous Ojai Valley.
- And what may look like a normal, five-year-old mattress is, in actuality, a luxurious massage table.
- Huh? Huh? ♪ Ha, ha, ha.
- A sheet has been provided for your discretion.
- Oh. (clears throat)
- Great.
- Quinn: Walker, what's going on?
- He claims he wants to give me a massage, but I think he's onto me.
- You almost ready?
- Just a second!
- Calm down.
- You should use this as an opportunity.
- Allow yourself to be vulnerable with him.
- It'll convince him that there's nothing wrong.
- Okay.
- Okay, I'm ready.
- (clears throat)
- All right.
- Here we go.
- (kissing sound) Starting with the application of the oil.
- (whistles)
- Ah, yes.
- Relax, relax.
- This would actually go a heck of a lot smoother if you just brought these down to your side, honey.
- So, just down to your side.
- Rela... There we go. There we go.
- See? Yes, better already. Breathe. Yeah...
- Baby, your muscles are so tight, they're hurting my hands.
- A lot of lactic acid buildup, huh?
- Why don't, why don't I crack your neck?
- No!
- What? What did I, what did I do?
- What did I say? You love it when I crack your neck.
- Quinn: Don't blow your cover, Walker. Talk to him!
- Uh, I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, Chuck.
- I really appreciate everything that you are trying to do.
- It's just that it's been a long couple days, and, um, you know, maybe it's just best if we go to bed.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
- Whatever you need.
- Wow! It's all ending, huh?
- What are you babbling about?
- I just get nostalgic, you know?
- Quinn's dead, Sarah's home safe, so we're done, man. No more missions.
- And no more g\*n.
- Think about it, Casey. Five years.
- I went from pipsqueaky sidekick to this.
- And you, you were the most cold-blooded sn\*per in the whole world, and now you're scrubbing our floors.
- Well, if you would use a plate when you're eating taquitos, I wouldn't have to scrub the floors, would I?
- Do you really think I've changed?
- I'm so glad that Sarah's back.
- Bill.
- Social event. Me, too. I don't know what Chuck would do without her.
- For you. For you.
- Babe... Babe, I just got a letter from...
- Carlos Shuman Medical Center?
- In Chicago offering me a research position.
- They want me to head up the cardiac division.
- They must know we're a couple.
- Babe, I think we're being wooed by Midwesterners.
- I know, I know. We could, we could buy a house.
- We could buy a big house.
- Okay.
- Are we... are we really considering this?
- We've lived our whole lives in California.
- We've always said a change would be nice.
- I just always assumed I would live close to Chuck.
- Yeah, yeah.
- But Sarah's back now.
- He's okay, right?
- Quinn, I found the glasses.
- Quinn: Good. Then, it is time to finish your mission.
- Take out Bartowski.
- Sarah?
- (sighs)
- (sighs contentedly)
- (whispers): Chuck just left.
- I'm following.
- Hey.
- Hi. Sorry. Did I wake you up?
- No. I couldn't sleep.
- How's Sarah?
- Um...
- You'd better come inside.
- Thanks.
- Chuck: I don't know. I guess,  it's, uh, the little things that are different.
- Like, her feet get cold at night, so I always put mine on top of hers to keep them warm.
- And I know it sounds stupid, but tonight she... pulled her feet away from mine, and she never pulled them away like that.
- Quinn: Walker, where are you?
- (whispers): Ellie's apartment.
- They're talking.
- Chuck, it's her first night back.
- I can't imagine what Sarah's been through.
- She's involved in this, too.
- What are they talking about?
- About me.
- I almost lost my best friend.
- And now, my wife, and always for the same reason, which is the Intersect, Ellie.
- Which is why I keep thinking that I need to destroy it for good this time.
- What do you mean?
- Quinn is dead, yes, but there will always be someone who wants it, and we will never be able to move on with our lives until it is gone.
- Quinn, are you hearing this?
- He doesn't want to download the Intersect onto the glasses.
- He wants to destroy it completely.
- I know where the latest version of the Intersect is being kept.
- All I need to do is sneak in and plant the virus.
- What do you want me to do?
- You have to go with Chuck and download it onto the glasses yourself to ensure its protection.
- It's up to you to keep it safe.
- Then you can k\*ll him.
- Just wanted to get a little... sisterly advice.
- (sighs)
- I think if you can be safe, then you should do it.
- It's what Dad always wanted.
- Thanks.
- Good luck.
- Get some sleep.
- Oh, no.
- Chuck?
- Yeah?
- I'm cold.
- Yeah?
- Hey, hey.
- (sighs)
- So that's how I figure we'll infiltrate DARPA headquarters.
- Once we're in the white room, I'll boot up their system.
- Sarah, you'll plant the virus using this, and we'll destroy the Intersect, once and for all.
- That seems a little drastic. .
- Yeah, well, it is drastic, Casey, but think of all the Intersect is responsible for.
- My father's death, Volkoff's very existence, Morgan's brain melting, Sarah...
- Let's just say, it's been more bad than good.
- When my dad found out I had it, he told me to destroy it, and I wish I had.
- We'd all be better off.
- I'm not gonna miss that opportunity again.
- If this is what you want, Chuck, I'm in.
- All right, I'm in.
- I'm on board, obviously.
- I also want to say that I'm really glad that we're having this third last mission, seeing as how I wasn't a part of the other two, uh...
- All right, we leave in 20.
- Hey, buddy, real quick-- you have any extra tranq darts?
- I used all mine up at tranq dart... practice.
- Yeah. Uh, actually, Sarah normally keeps an extra clip for me in her bag, so...
- No dice, buddy.
- She must have forgotten.
- Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it.
- Hey, Casey, Chuck says you got to let me use your tranq darts.
- What is she doing with these?
- (whirring and chirping)
- (g\*n)
- (beeping)
- (whirring)
- (beeping, whirring and chirping)
- (air hissing)
- (researcher sniffing)
- What the... ?
- (beeps)
- (drill whirring)
- (sighs)
- (whirring)
- Three, two, one.
- (sighs, inhales through nose)
- I think we're okay.
- Let's find the Intersect crew.
- We won't have long before they wake up.
- Look at this place.
- It's incredible! Wow!
- What's under here?
- It's like a big silver ghost.
- (laughs)
- It's creepy.
- (whooshing)
- A cloak of invisibility!
- Yes!
- You're a wizard, Harry.
- Grimes, Grimes, what, are you on a diet?
- What are, what are you talking about?
- Well, 'cause you started to disappear in front of my eyes.
- Get it? Get it? Oh.
- Hey, the Intersect room is down this hall. Let's go.
- What? What? Sorry, I couldn't hear you.
- I'm the headless Grimesman.
- (laughing): Headless Grimesman.
- You...
- It wasn't me. It wasn't me.
- It was the one-armed man. You find this man.
- Go. You never saw The Fugitive?
- Five guards.
- All right, Team, what's the plan?
- Let's use some sort of distraction. I think if, uh, you threw like a rock.
- Sarah?
- (grunts)
- (groans) (grunts)
- (grunts)
- (grunts) Hey! Oh!
- (men thudding to floor)
- Let's go.
- (whistles) Wow.
- Quite a woman you got in your hands, huh, buddy?
- Yeah.
- (electronic chirping)
- (keypad beeping)
- (clacking, whooshing)
- (door opens)
- Chuck: All right, just give me a few minutes to get the system up and running.
- All right, got it.
- Sarah, you're on.
- (chirps)
- Chuck: I'm not sure for how long, though, so upload the virus now.
- Uploading.
- It should have gone through by now.
- Is there something wrong?
- Just a second.
- (beeps)
- Casey: Walker!
- Drop the g\*n.
- Sarah? Sarah, what are you doing?
- Drop the g\*n.
- Now, I have the Intersect, and you can't destroy it, and you can't hurt anybody else with it.
- Baby, what are you talking about?
- Quinn told me the truth.
- Quinn's not dead?
- I know about you.
- I know what you've done, all of you.
- I know everything.
- I don't know what's happening right now, but whatever he told you is a lie.
- The Intersect is-is...
- It's damaged your memory or something, because the Sarah that I know would never do something like this.
- Baby, please.
- It's me.
- It's your Chuck.
- Quinn (over comms): Get the hell out of there, Walker!
- (groans)
- Don't!
- (whooshing)
- (door clanks shut)
- (g\*n, electrical crackling)
- (rhythmic beeping)
- This can't be happening.
- It doesn't make any sense.
- (beeping quickens)
- (rapid beeping)
- She attached an expl\*sive to the door.
- She could detonate it at any second.
- No. No, she wouldn't.
- We gotta take cover.
- She wouldn't.
- Quinn, maybe we don't have to do this.
- They're locked inside.
- They'll be arrested.
- That's not your call.
- (expl\*si\*n inside building)
- (coughs) We gotta get out of here before more guards come.
- What just happened?
- Sarah, sh-she just...
- Quinn must've turned her into thinking that she works for him.
- Now she has exactly what he's been looking for: the last version of the Intersect.
- No, she doesn't.
- I switched them out.
- What the hell? How'd you do that?
- I saw the glasses in her bag before we left.
- I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to believe it.
- But deep down, I knew it was true.
- My wife never came home.
- (tires screech)
- That was a government facility you just blew up.
- And that was a man who deserved to die.
- Did you get the glasses?
- These are empty.
- They're fake!
- That's not possible. I had them on me the whole time.
- No one got close to you?
- Chuck. Chuck did, I guess.
- As I was leaving, he tried to grab me... and, and convince me that our relationship was real.
- I guess he must've switched them out then.
- This is exactly what I warned you about, Agent Walker.
- That's why I pushed the detonator button.
- This man is a liar; he is a manipulator.
- (cell phone rings)
- He's still alive?
- I made a mistake.
- And I can promise you I will not make the same mistake again.
- I will get those glasses back no matter what it takes.
- She's not picking up.
- Of course she's not picking up, dude! She's evil!
- Okay, that's a little unfair.
- It's the faulty Intersect talking.
- It's kind of like what happened with me, only much, much worse.
- Seeing as how she tried to k\*ll us.
- Quinn turned her. We have to consider the fact that maybe she's gone.
- Hoe can you say that? She's your friend!
- And she's not gone. Not completely anyway.
- Oh, yeah? Did his memory come magically back after the Intersect? You know it didn't.
- All I have to do is remind her of who she really is.
- You know, look, look, I have, I have the glasses.
- Even if she doesn't remember me, I know that she wanted these.
- She tried to k\*ll us, Chuck.
- Can't pretend that everything is as it was.
- Otherwise, she's gonna succeed next time.
- And I'm not gonna lose you both.
- You honestly think that?
- She's a trained assassin. She knows where we live, she knows where our families live.
- He's right, Chuck. He's right, okay?
- What about Ellie and Awesome?
- She wouldn't.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- (ringing)
- Hey, bro, I'm sorry.
- I was just trying to get Clara down for a nap. What's up?
- Are you okay? Is everyone all right?
- Yeah, of course.
- (sighs) Thank God.
- Everyone's at the apartment?
- Well, no. Ellie just went to grab a cup of coffee with Sarah. Why?
- I'm glad we're doing this.
- You've been through so much lately.
- How are you holding up?
- Oh, I'm fine, thank you.
- We're all really worried about you.
- Chuck's was a wreck.
- I can imagine.
- (phone rings)
- Oh.
- Mm, speak of the devil.
- Do you mind? I actually have to talk to him.
- SARAH (over speaker): Hey, sweetie.
- So, I see you that you switched out the Intersect glasses.
- That was a nice move.
- Should've known I couldn't trust you.
- I have some moves of my own.
- We're at the Bergamot Café off Gower.
- Bring the glasses; come alone.
- You have 15 minutes.
- This is crazy, Sarah. Please.
- Oh, Bartowski, if you try anything...
- Sarah, what are you doing?
- I'm gonna put a b\*llet between your sister's eyes.
- Oh, my God.
- Beckman: I've heard enough. You were right to contact me.
- Go to that café.
- But convince Sarah that you've hidden the Intersect glasses somewhere else.
- I'm moving men into place at Regal Plaza.
- Get Sarah there.
- And then what? Have a sn\*per take her out?
- We will do whatever it takes to ensure the safety of your sister while bringing in Agent Walker peacefully.
- But, Chuck, you know that what happens in that plaza depends entirely on Sarah.
- Sarah, I think that the Intersect may have damaged...
- Stop talking. I know you're involved.
- Chuck: You okay?
- You got the glasses?
- I don't have them with me.
- Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!
- Just wait a second, okay?
- Whatever you think I've done, she didn't do anything. She's innocent.
- So I will lead you to the glasses, but just you and me, okay?
- Please, just let her go.
- I'll follow you in a separate car.
- She'll come with me.
- If I see anything suspicious, I...
- Well, you'd better hope I don't.
- Okay, okay. Follow me.
- You drive.
- Casey: All right, Bartowski, we have eyes on the plaza.
- Okay, she's following me, but, Casey, she brought Ellie with her.
- Don't worry, Chuck. I'll make sure Ellie comes out of this without a scratch.
- Sarah... you don't have to do this.
- Casey, what if she resists?
- Hey, this isn't the Sarah you know.
- You were in my wedding. You were at the hospital when my baby was born. We're family.
- No, we're not. This was always a mission for me, and today I'm gonna finish it.
- Chuck, you listen to me.
- She's not in there anymore.
- Sarah's gone.
- No, she's not.
- My wife is not gone.
- Bartowski? Chuck!
- Where are you going? !
- So once you get the glasses, what then, hmm?
- What happens to Chuck?
- Just stay close.
- Okay, he's right up there ahead.
- If you could remember, if you were still you, you would want me to do anything I could to save Chuck.
- You would want this.
- Want what?
- Sorry, Sarah.
- (engine revs)
- Sarah: Ellie, no!
- (horn blaring)
- Ellie.
- Oh, God, are you okay? I'm okay.
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking about protecting you.
- Chuck, Sarah's trying to k\*ll you.
- There's something seriously wrong with her, Chuck.
- That's why I'm taking her somewhere that'll help her remember.
- (grunts)
- Quinn: Agent Walker, what's happening?
- Walker, where are you?
- What if she doesn't remember?
- She's further gone than Morgan ever was, Chuck.
- You need to call the CIA.
- You need to turn her in.
- Listen, everyone keeps telling me that Sarah's gone, but she's not. She's right here.
- Chuck...
- What if it was Devon?
- Hey, where are you? Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine, but Chuck isn't.
- He just, he just took off with Sarah.
- Damn it, Bartowski.
- John, I know my little brother, and I know where he would take her.
- Hi.
- Look, I know you don't remember me.
- I thought maybe you'd remember this, our dream home... the one you always told me that you wanted.
- Our relationship was a cover, Bartowski.
- Always has been.
- You're just an assignment.
- No, I was an assignment, and then you fell in love with me.
- And I know that sounds crazy, and if I didn't know any better, I-I'd say it's crazy, too.
- But the fact remains, you fell for me, Sarah, you did.
- My job is too make you think that I feel something.
- That's what I do best; I lie.
- Actually, you're not as good a liar as you think you are.
- It's true, okay?
- Our first kiss, not our, not our first cover kiss, but our first, our first real kiss...
- was when we were trying to defuse a b\*mb and we we thought we were gonna die, and I closed my eyes and...
- I felt you grab me and kiss me.
- You kissed me.
- And then there was a lot of pretending that it didn't happen and awkward back-and-forth and even dating other people, but one day, one day when I was sure...  that you could never love a nerd like me, you came over... and I asked you if you loved me.
- Sarah, do you love me?
- And you, Sarah Walker... said yes.
- And when I asked you to marry me, you didn't even have to say yes because we both knew, we both knew that we'd spend the rest of our lives together.
- So, please remember this house and the red door and the white picket fence and the family that we were going to raise together and remember me.
- Because if you remember me... then you'd remember... that a nerdy guy like me who works at the Buy More... could make you happy.
- So I'm going to give you a choice right here, right now.
- It's up to you.
- You can either take a chance on me, and we can start over...
- (sniffling)
- ... or you can take these glasses that you came for and never see me again.
- (sighs)
- This is real.
- You really love me?
- With all of my heart.
- I'm sorry, I did my job too well.
- But I have a mission to finish, and I need those glasses.
- No, you can't!
- Ow!
- Give them to me!
- Ahh!
- (glass shattering)
- Why won't you fight back?
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- (both grunting)
- I'm never gonna hurt you.
- Sarah, you're my wife!
- (groans)
- (grunts)
- (Chuck panting)
- (straining)
- (panting)
- (g\*n cocking)
- (panting)
- You can k\*ll me.
- I will never hurt you.
- I wrote that.
- Yeah, you did.
- CHUCK (distorted, echoing): Honey, you know we don't...
- Sarah: I know... but we will... one day, this will all be ours.
- And when it is, I would like to always remember this moment.
- (voice echoing)
- Very good work, Agent Walker.
- The glasses?
- You've lied to her!
- You used her!
- You're right.
- He's right, I'm not CIA.
- And, uh, I suppose I could explain it all to you, but honestly, you're not worth the time.
- Quinn: Good-bye, Sarah.
- Chuck: No!
- (b\*ll\*ts ricocheting)
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- (sirens wailing in distance)
- I'm wearing a vest.
- They're coming for you, Sarah.
- (sirens grow louder)
- (gasping): Run.
- But... Run!
- (tires screeching, men running to door)
- (gasping groan)
- (wheezing)
- He's here.
- Chuck? Oh, my God. Chuck.
- Hi.
- Where's Sarah?
- She's gone.
- Sarah's gone.
- You're lucky the b\*llet only hit your vest, bro.
- Yes, it's the best news I've heard all day.
- (groaning)
- All right, all right, I'll get you something for the pain.
- Thank you.
- I lost her, Ellie.
- For a split second, it felt like she was starting to remember, but she's gone.
- Why don't you get some sleep.
- I'll be right here when you wake up.
- Come on.
- (soft grunt)
- Thanks.
- Don't ever leave me.
- Never.
- Figured I'd find you here.
- You can put the kn\*fe down; I'm not here to fight.
- What do you remember about me?
- Your reputation, mostly.
- Unfriendly, unforgiving and... unquestioning about your orders.
- That's funny.
- When we met, people said the same thing about you.
- Probably why we never got along, huh?
- Well, if we didn't get along, then why are you here?
- I guess Bartowski's made us both a little soft.
- Beckman's got a new job for me, but... these past five years, we changed, you know.
- We became friends.
- Take care of yourself, Walker.

- SARAH (on video): Day One.
- My mission is simple: find out what he knows, gain his trust, and monitor his actions until the agency can decide what to do with him.
- Day 21.
- Chuck came over to my hotel room today and brought me a pizza.
- Vegetarian, no olives.
- I think he's making it his mission to get to know me.
- It's sweet.
- Day 49.
- Chuck broke up with me today.
- Well, uh, Fake... Fake broke up with me, technically.
- Day 56.
- Chuck I were defusing a b\*mb today, and there was a moment where we were sure we were going to die.
- He closed his eyes, and...
- I kissed him.
- I... kissed him.
- Day 564.
- Things are calm for once.
- No missions, nothing... nothing really to report, except I still find myself sitting here, talking to myself, because... because I love him.
- I love Chuck Bartowski, and I don't know what to do about it.
- (sighs)
- You sure you don't want to spend the night?
- You're more than welcome.
- I'm gonna have to go home eventually.
- Tonight is as good a night as any, I suppose.
- Okay.
- Well, I'm coming over bright and early, and I'm making you pancakes.
- Night, sis.
- Love you.
- Love you, too.
- Sarah: Chuck?
- Sarah!
- I-I just wanted to tell you that I believe you.
- I believe everything that you told me about us.
- But... the truth is, Chuck, I...
- I don't feel it.
- Everything that you told me about us and our story--
- I just... I don't feel it.
- Right.
- (wry laugh)
- Right, of course, I...
- I don't know what I was expecting, you know?
- So, what are you doing here, then?
- Well, I wanted to say sorry for everything that happened today.
- But, uh, most of all, I wanted to say good-bye.
- Where are you going?
- Quinn took away my life, and I have to...
- Well, I have to go find him.
- Bye.
- Bye.
