# Chuck Versus the Santa Suit

- Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know.
- The Omen. A computer virus that can erase a hundred zetabytes of data per second.
- It could take down the Internet, crash airplanes, and erase every database in the world.
- In truth, Chuck, the virus is just a piece of the plan.
- What happens now?
- That's the real surprise, isn't it?
- There. The Omen is officially unleashed upon the world.
- ♪
- (people talking loudly)
- Christmas cheer? Try Christmas fear.
- A virus dubbed "The Omen" has infected computers worldwide.
- And it has Christmas shoppers in a panic.
- Are their hard drives in danger of being erased?
- Or, is the virus a gag that does nothing?
- Why panic? Ask yourself: what would baby Jesus do?
- And you are... ?
- I'm Michael Tucker, assistant manager of Burbank Buy More.
- I want customers to remember the true meaning of Christmas, and get back to what you're supposed to be doing: buying stuff.
- Like this iPad! A bargain for $599.
- Honestly, it's overpriced.
- You can get all this stuff on the Internet.
- See, everything is fine here at the Buy More.
- Totally fine!
- No computer virus problems here.
- Lester: Dear God! Jeffrey!
- I need your help, buddy. These people are animals.
- The virus is everywhere, and nobody knows how to stop it!
- Nobody knows how to stop it!
- What is going on here?
- Reporter: Authorities do not know who is responsible for the Omen virus, but assume it is an act of cyber-terrorism...
- Every prison cell in here is connected to the mainframe.
- What if the Omen virus hits us?
- You worry too much.
- Take another snort of almond-milk nog.
- Do you hear that?
- (grunts)
- We are so crazy behind, and I can't find it!
- Find what?
- The star for the top of the Christmas tree, the one that Dad gave me.
- Deep breaths, Namaste style.
- Devon, it's Christmas Eve, we are having a party in six hours, we don't have a tree, we don't have decorations...
- I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
- What are you doing?
- I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
- Saying your name aloud helps to calm you.
- Reminds you you're in control of your own actions.
- I am Eleanor Woodcomb. I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
- Yeah, that didn't work.
- Okay.
- What are you freaking out about?
- Because Christmas was my first memory, okay?
- The presents, the smell of fresh-baked cookies, and I know that Clara is a little young, but I thought that maybe it could be her first memory, too, and I just...
- I want everything to be perfect.
- All right.
- What's going to turn that frown upside down?
- A real tree, lights, fake snow, and a picture of Clara on Santa's lap?
- That's a tall order, babe.
- I know.
- But... that is why I recruited someone onto our team.
- (phone rings) Ellie.
- Ellie: Sarah, I need an update.
- It's okay. Project Santa is under control.
- Got the decorations from your list, you just need to get the tree and the snow.
- Ellie: Thanks.
- Okay, bye.
- Hey, Sarah. Your sister is in full-blown Christmas mode.
- Chuck: Well, it wouldn't be Christmas with the Bartowskis without a little bit of drama.
- Speaking of which...
- No progress on the virus?
- Whoever's behind this is a ghost. Untraceable.
- No. There is no such thing.
- They just haven't slipped up yet.
- And when they do? Carmichael Industries will be there to take them down. But for now, I promise nobody is going to ruin our Christmas.
- Just everyone else's.
- Chuck, it's going to be okay.
- Look, I'm going to lock up Castle and come home.
- Oh, by the way, will you tell Casey, uh... Mr. Pippers, the Preppy Polar Bear, has arrived.
- Mr. Pippers? Really?
- Oh, man, that's like our favorite childhood toy, right?
- Chuck: One of, yeah.
- Top five. Maybe. But still, our generation.
- Not really yours. I got it on eBay.
- Alex's mom said she used to run around with a little bear thing like that. It's still in its original package.
- I thought it was a good idea. Dumb, huh?
- No.
- It's actually quite touching.
- Like you're feeling real human emotion.
- Don't you ever say that again.
- And don't you breathe a word of this to Alex.
- No. No. My lips are... my lips are sealed.
- Christmas presents are sacred in the Grimes family.
- Beckman: Gentlemen.
- General.
- We have an emergency.
- We know who's behind this.
- Merry Christmas, Sarah.
- Miss me?
- Not for a second.
- Ah!
- That's no way to treat an old boyfriend.
- (grunts)
- Just give up, Walker.
- You're no match for the Intersect.

- (whimpers)
- (groans, gasps)
- Comfy?
- No?
- Good.
- 69% complete.
- Only a couple more hours before the virus activates.
- What are you doing, Shaw?
- You're the one behind the Omen?
- The plan?
- (grunts)
- Surprise.
- Why?
- (snorts)
- Why stay in jail when I can break out, release the virus... and take over the CIA?
- Oops. Gave away my plan.
- (cell phone rings)
- Sarah, thank God!
- Shaw broke out of prison, where are you?
- Sarah?
- Hello, nerd.
- Shaw: Do me a favor?
- Turn on the monitor.
- Merry Christmas!
- Hey, can I tell you a story?
- You untie Sarah right now.
- There's this tradition in Germany where Santa Claus-- or Krampus, as they call him-- visits all the naughty children on Christmas Eve.
- But instead of giving them coal, he wakes them up, and the naughtiest of children never see Christmas Day.
- Let her go.
- Or what?
- No Sarah, no Intersect...
- You're worthless, Chuck.
- I've put Castle on lockdown.
- Do everything I say.
- Or she dies.
- Get my drift?
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you put me in jail?
- Because of our last fight, because you tried to k*ll me?
- So much history, Chuck.
- It could be anything.
- Fine. What do you want?
- Shaw: The CIA base downtown.
- Break into Clyde Decker's office, retrieve the Macau device, and bring it to me.
- What is it? What does it look like?
- Figure it out.
- You have three hours.
- Don't you hurt her.
- Impressed?
- I implicated Chuck in a massive conspiracy, and captured his girl.
- All from an 8x8 cell.
- You... working with Clyde Decker? How?
- Decker was a slug.
- He tried to interrogate me, and in one flash I knew all his filthy secrets.
- A little blackmail, and his entire team was working for me.
- You know what the best part is?
- There's nothing that Chuck can do to stop me.
- Morgan: What now, Chuck?
- Chuck?
- Oh, boy.
- This is bad.
- This is really bad. He is shutting down.
- Casey: Then we take care of Shaw ourselves.
- Yeah, but he has the Intersect.
- I mean, we're going to need a plan, a really good plan.
- I've got the plan.
- Daniel Shaw m*rder my father, and now he has my wife.
- He's gonna wish he never left that prison cell.
- That plan's kind of vague. Morgan, I need you to reverse-engineer that virus. Use the nerds.
- If they're focused, they're better than any computer expert in the CIA.
- We need to figure out exactly what happens when that virus activates.
- I'm on it. Casey.
- Find alternate routes into Castle.
- I need options in case I can't get the device that Shaw wants.
- Whoa, whoa, hold on.
- You're going to break into the CIA?
- Decker's office is on level five. Omega level.
- You go in alone, it's su1c1de.
- Who said anything about going in there alone?
- The Macau device was stolen two months ago from a Chinese technology company.
- It compresses huge quantities of data to fit onto a single computer hard drive.
- Why would Shaw want it?
- I have no idea.
- What's the best way for me to get into the CIA?
- There's only one way in.
- With me.
- General, I can't tell you how happy I am to hear you say that, but you realize you're putting yourself on the line here.
- This is my team.
- And nobody, especially Shaw, is going to take us down.
- Morgan: I just got off the phone with Buy More Corporate.
- They want to know everything there is to know about this Omen virus-- what happens when it activates.
- In order to stop it, we need to know its next move.
- (mouse clicks)
- Fold.
- I-- no, no.
- You guys are the only ones that understand C++ and a bunch of other computer languages, okay?
- I need you to crack this thing, I need you to do it now. (yawns)
- Yeah. N. I.
- What?
- Not interested.
- Thank you.
- It's an immature response, I know, but I, too, am underincentivized.
- Until this virus is cracked, nobody's buying any crap at the Buy More.
- Which means no double overtime and no Christmas bonus.
- True.
- But it seems a little above and beyond our usual duties.
- Name your price.
- I got this.
- (clears throat)
- I would like a... six-inch Classic Italian BMT from Subway. Boom.
- I was going to say a trip to the Bahamas.
- Subway. Done. I'll make it a footlong.
- Nice! Make mine flatbread, boys!
- I'm going into Castle, in through the ducts.
- All right. Hey, be careful.
- (clamoring)
- It's a w*r zone.
- Some scrooge stole Christmas right out of the Buy More.
- Mike, I'm really sorry to bother you.
- Maybe we should just forget it.
- You kidding?
- Getting this angel her picture with Santa might be the only cheer I get to spread around here this year.
- Let Santa just grab his suit.
- Damn hell!
- What kind of monster steals a Santa suit on Christmas Eve, but leaves the eyebrows?
- I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
- Babe, don't worry, I'm calling in the big g*n.
- Chuck, there's been a robbery at the Buy More.
- Brace yourself: the Santa suit is gone.
- Chuck: Well, that's terrible.
- Sounds like someone could use a dose of the Christmas spirit.
- Just promise me that you and Sarah will make it in time for Christmas dinner.
- Ellie really needs her family around right now.
- Yeah, yeah, of course, buddy.
- We wouldn't miss it for the world.
- My wife has been kidnapped, and I'm officially ruining Christmas for the children of Burbank.
- We have a CIA Christmas party to crash.
- Now let's go save our girl.
- Why's it getting so cold in here?
- Tapped into the internal generator, lowered the temperature.
- To stop the mainframe from overheating.
- Once the virus activates, the resulting data influx could fry it in seconds.
- You with me?
- No, you're not.
- If you were, you would've brought a coat, silly.
- You're going into hypothermic shock.
- Pretty soon, you'll be in and out of consciousness until finally your heart stops b*at.
- Why don't you just k*ll me?
- k*ll you?
- This is about you.
- Why do you think I wanted you in Castle and I sent Chuck to the CIA?
- We both know that you're the superior spy.
- I've missed you.
- You're insane.
- What we had was special.
- I know you felt it.
- I'm sure you've laid in bed at night thinking about me beside you.
- I'd rather be dead.
- (computer beeps)
- Got what I needed.
- SARAH'S VOICE: This is Sarah Walker, and Daniel Shaw is in complete control of me.
- I don't know what your plan is, but... it's not going to work.
- Shaw's so handsome and smart.
- I bet he reads lots of books.
- You think you can b*at Chuck?
- You're not half the man that he is.
- You're not half the man that he is.
- This isn't about Chuck, Sarah.
- This really is about you.
- See, I'm finally going to crush your soul... the way that you crushed mine.
- Mmm.
- 12 inches of bubbly cheese, spicy pepperoni and ham.
- You really should try the Fresh Fit option.
- No-No offense.
- Thank you.
- What have we got so far?
- All right, so if this virus hits at the expected rate and magnitude, everything electronic will shut down-- traffic lights, computers.
- God, can you imagine a world without the Internet?
- What if it's up to us?
- Two Buy More employees left to stop the Omen virus and save the world.
- Come on.
- The government has their best people working on this.
- Right?
- ♪
- Beckman: God, I hate corporate Christmas parties.
- Everyone turns into sloppy, embarrassing messes.
- Well, hello, Diane.
- Oh, Stan, not again.
- How about joining me at the punch bowl?
- Enough.
- You're embarrassing yourself, Stan.
- Well, if that's gonna be your attitude.
- That is so weird.
- Los Angeles spies.
- Now focus.
- The woman by the giant Subway sandwich is your target.
- Mm-hmm.
- Colonel Caroline Hayne.
- She's in charge of internal security with electronic access to every room in this building, including Decker's office.
- So what's our next move?
- Seduce her, Bartowski.
- Steal her key card.
- She's a notorious tight ass, except for one night of the year.
- Tonight.
- Six hot toddies and men are running for cover.
- And you're sure I'm her type?
- You're drawing breath and you're in a Santa suit.
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
- Oh! Merry Christmas.
- Or Happy Hanukkah.
- Whichever is applicable.
- You look like you want some alone time with old Saint Nick.
- I want to sit on your lap.
- (grunts)
- (panting nervously)
- Whoo!
- I don't think Mrs. Claus would approve of any "shenanigans, " you know.
- Well, it's a good thing Mrs. Claus is a no-show.
- (chuckles nervously)
- Oh, that seems inappropriate!
- (chuckling nervously)
- Oh.
- Ooh, yeah!
- Naughty Santa.
- Uh...
- That's just how I like it.
- (Beckman clears throat)
- Caroline.
- Diane.
- Mr. Claus, I will personally escort you off the premises.
- Oh, what a shame!
- Merry Christmas!
- Happy Kwanzaa!
- Pull yourself together.
- Play a little cat and mouse?
- (door beeps) Fine.
- But I'll find you.
- I know you're unarmed.
- The armory's been on lockdown.
- You can't hide.
- I know every secret, every mission, every mistake.
- Scar on your left hand--
- Calgary, 2004.
- You never tried catching throwing stars after that, did you?
- I know everything, Sarah.
- I know everything.
- You're upset with me.
- That's obvious.
- But do you really think I want to spend the holidays with you?
- That I wouldn't rather be with my family?
- It's a trick question, Sarah.
- Because you sh*t my wife in cold bl*od.
- You brought this all upon yourself.
- (dull clanking)
- (grunting)
- (groans)
- (g*n clicks)
- (grunting)
- Very disappointing, Casey.
- (beep)
- We have less than a minute before a team figures we've broken in.
- Never took Decker for much of an art collector.
- (whirring)
- I think I found it.
- (computer beeping)
- Colonel Hayne just accessed Decker's office, but I'm looking at her.
- She's in the bullpen.
- We got a code five.
- This way, Colonel Hayne.
- Our minute came and went.
- What are we gonna do?
- There's no place to hide.
- Pucker up, Bartowski.
- You're about to become a man.
- What, like a Bar Mitzvah?
- Or something that's a little...
- What exactly are you...
- (g*n click)
- Santa!
- Retreat immediately or I will see you court-martialed!
- (huffs)
- You know, I typically brush my teeth before I...
- We never speak of this again.
- Never... ever...
- (keypad beeping)
- Shaw, I've got the device.
- Sarah: Chuck, it's me.
- Sarah, oh, my God. You okay?
- Yeah.
- I escaped Shaw and I'm hiding in Castle, (Sarah's voice): ... but Shaw's still down here-- hurry!
- I'm on my way.
- Morgan: I know, I know, I know.
- It's a madhouse. It's a madhouse.
- Good thing is that Jeff and Lester made some progress.
- How'd your day go? I got the Macau Device, and Sarah's hiding out in Castle.
- (phone rings)
- Sarah. Hey. Is everything okay?
- SARAH'S VOICE: Casey disarmed Shaw.
- He's locked up.
- Thank God. I'll be there soon.
- Hurry up, dear.
- How'd that go? Everything all right?
- Sarah says that Casey took down Shaw.
- Yes! Nice! Way to go.
- She called me "dear. "
- She never calls me dear.
- Shaw's using her somehow.
- Oh, crap.
- Last time he was in control, he bought the Buy More.
- (shoppers clamoring)
- Morgan, we've got to get all these people out of here.
- I tried, Morgan.
- But we haven't made a single sale all night.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. Don't be, buddy.
- It's okay.
- Attention, Buy More shoppers.
- Um...
- I know everyone's a little scared about this Omen virus... but, uh, you should not be waiting in line on Christmas Eve.
- All right? It's not about the gifts, it's about spending time with your friends and your family.
- And-and-and-and eggnog and cheer-- spreading lots of cheer.
- So, uh, as of now, uh, the Buy More is officially closed for the holiday.
- (shoppers protesting) Sorry!
- Thank you, come again and, uh, and shop at Buy More.
- Sorry! Sorry!
- You're gonna have to... gonna have to, kinda...
- Chuck: Thanks, buddy.
- Well, come on, son, I'll drive you home.
- Your mama's cooking us a big, fat, honey-glazed ham.
- Aw... You know what?
- I'm gonna stay here and close up shop.
- Can you make sure everyone gets out safe?
- All right. Okay.
- Hey. What's happening?
- Ellie, what are you... ? What are you... ?
- We're-We're-We're closing down for the night.
- The picture with Santa was a bust.
- I sent Devon and Clara home. Mom's flight's cancelled.
- Sarah was supposed to help with the decorations, and now she's not answering her phone.
- Have you heard from her?
- Yeah, uh, sort of.
- She's kind of busy.
- Chuck, what's going on?
- (sighs)
- It's Shaw.
- He kidnapped Sarah.
- Daniel Shaw, who k*ll Dad?
- Um... what can I do?
- I... I hate to say this-- just-just go home.
- No, I want to help!
- Ellie, please, go home, okay?
- I have to know that you're safe.
- (sighs)
- Okay, but call me.
- Call me as soon as you know something, okay?
- Yes. Yes. Okay.
- Chuck, you be careful.
- I love you.
- (groaning)
- (coughing)
- (Sarah grunting)
- You sick son of a bitch!
- Just wanted to see if any of the old fire was still there.
- No. Ice-cold.
- This was Mary Bartowski's, wasn't it?
- I think I'll keep it.
- Token of our last night together.
- I had no idea she was your wife, Shaw.
- I had no idea who you were.
- I was just...
- I was just on an assignment.
- Mm. Is that supposed to make me feel better?
- I was just a young agent.
- I was just doing my job, okay?
- You, of all people, need to understand that.
- (shudders)
- Really?
- Well, what about the pit you dug out of my chest?
- Is that supposed to fill it in?
- Is this going to?
- You're a good man, Shaw.
- You can be that man again.
- Just stop what you're doing, please.
- Okay?
- You can let this... you can let this all go.
- I know you're in pain, and you want this to stop, but not yet.
- Not until you feel a pain more excruciating than you ever imagined.
- Chuck is coming up with a way to stop you as we speak.
- We have reason to believe this whole entire Omen virus, end of the world, apocalyptic thingy-- it's a hoax-- it's literally a hoax.
- Jeff: The virus is hypothetically designed to suck information out of a whole set of computers and move that information to a single location.
- But it's not doing that. It's absolutely not doing that.
- Jeff: Or it's not doing that with our computers.
- It looks like this virus is targeting government computers.
- I think it's a real-life conspiracy.
- Problem is, no one computer can hold all that information.
- Lester: Right? Right?
- Yeah. Of course not. Of course not...
- Morgan, it's not going into a computer.
- Shaw is using the Macau Device to relocate the CIA database into his brain.
- He's trying to create the Intersect 3. 0.
- Oh, crap. With the CIA's databases wiped clean, they'll have to rely on Shaw for their intel.
- They have to make him a spy again.
- Gentlemen! Gentlemen, uh... the Buy More is closed. You can go home.
- Happy holidays. Maybe drink some water.
- Water can only dilute this feeling.
- Plus, fish have sex in it.
- Jeffrey, let's go for a run.
- Great idea. Great idea.
- Great idea.
- Morgan: All right, Chuck, tell me you got some kind of an idea here, 'cause I'm a little scared.
- Don't freak out.
- I've got an idea.
- Morgan: Okay. I just hope it works.
- Me, too.
- Seeing as how our lives kind of depend on it.
- You knew that, right?
- Yeah.
- (elevator clanking, whirring)
- (phone ringing)
- Chuck: You've got the device.
- Now let Sarah go and take me instead.
- And why would I trust you?
- Look at the monitor.
- Buy More is empty.
- You can come up here and k*ll me.
- As long as Sarah's safe.
- Pitiful.
- (whirring, blipping, powering up)
- Good, you're awake.
- You know what the ultimate revenge is?
- Spending Christmas Eve with you.
- I'm gonna let you live.
- I want you to watch while I k*ll your husband.
- (shuddering)
- Chuck has a plan.
- So do I.
- And I've spent the last two years in prison, perfecting it.
- You k*ll my wife.
- Now you're gonna suffer, just like I did.
- You're gonna spend the rest of your life without Chuck.
- (gasping)
- Hi, I'm Mr. Pippers, the Preppy Polar Bear.
- You can leave a message by pressing hard on my paw.
- Have fun.

- Alex...
- Dad...
- I just want you to know that I'm proud of you... and I'm sorry I haven't been there for you all these years.
- (groans)
- ... and I'm really sorry that I'm having to tell you this recorded on an electronic bear.
- Electronic bear.
- I'm unarmed.
- You can sh**t me now, if that's your plan.
- But for some reason, I don't think it is.
- No, you're absolutely right.
- It's very important that I enjoy this.
- Really?
- Well, that's a nice idea, Shaw.
- However, if I remember correctly, the last time we were face to face, I kicked your ass.
- (scoffs)
- I made sure that'll never happen again.
- No Intersect to help you this time, Chuck.
- ♪
- I wouldn't be too sure about that.
- I've been training for a while now.
- Oh, really?
- Well, can you compete with the Intersect 3. 0?
- I can practically catch a b*llet in my teeth.
- But you did some push-ups?
- You hit the heavy bag?
- Oh, just so you know, while you're begging for mercy, your wife is watching.
- ♪
- I've spent every waking second in jail thinking about this moment.
- This time, I'm going to k*ll you.
- (sighs)
- You seriously underestimate the power of the Nerd Herd.
- The Omen virus-- you put it...
- Inside your head.
- Instead of downloading the Intersect 3. 0, you removed it.
- And it turns out that's the last flash you're ever going to have.
- (grunting and groaning)
- I'm a much bigger nerd than you thought I was.
- Oh, geez.
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- Wake up. Wake...

- Hang in there. I got this. I got this.
- Uh, I'm going to pick you up with the chair.
- All right, so just bear with me.
- Okay.
- (groans)
- Oh, my God. Oh, man.
- (electrical crackling)
- One, two...
- I'm still going to k*ll you.
- (straining): I'd like to see you try.
- I've been working on that one.
- That one's for Sarah.
- Is that all you got?
- I got a little bit more.
- All right, listen to me. Listen to me.
- You're going to have to wake up. You have to wake up because you're bolted in here and I don't have a key for the lock.
- (g*n fires)
- (groaning)
- What are you... ? Y-you're sh*t. You're-you're bleeding.
- Shut up, numbnuts. We got to get her out of here.
- Get her.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- (grunting)
- Whoa.
- "Dear"?
- "Hurry up, dear"?
- Sloppy, Shaw.
- Won't happen again.
- (grunting and groaning)
- That was for my dad.
- You're good, Chuck.
- But you're not lucky.
- That was for me.
- Nice sh*t, sis.
- But I told you to stay at home.
- I'm Eleanor Woodcomb.
- Since when do I do what I'm told?
- That man took our father away from us, Chuck.
- I wasn't going to let him take anybody else.
- Merry Christmas, Ellie.
- Merry Christmas, Chuck.
- Authorities have confirmed, that the Omen virus was planted by a t*rror1st named Daniel Shaw.
- A private security team stopped him before the virus was activated.
- And although they've chosen to remain anonymous, we here at KCKH want to say thank you and also wish our viewers a happy holiday.
- And now, onto other news, where a dog barks like a duck.
- All members of Carmichael Industries have a position open to them at the CIA.
- The agency would be lucky to have you back.
- Well, we couldn't have done it without you.
- So thanks, colleague.
- With that, I'll bid you farewell and Merry Christmas.
- Do you have a place to spend the holidays?
- You could come to our place.
- Ellie: Yeah, but, Sarah, I think my Christmas party's a bust.
- No, no, no, no.
- Your Christmas party is not a bust, sis.
- Don't you know that when you roll with General Diane Beckman, you roll in style?
- General... don't you think the CIA could help us throw just a little eensy-weensy Bartowski family Christmas party?
- You're talking about American tax dollars at work.
- Oh, hell, let's do it.
- That's the spirit.
- ♪
- (laughs) Aw.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- I know that without Mom and Dad around, it could never be a perfect Christmas, but I hope you know that you'll always have me.
- I do.
- Felt pretty good taking down Shaw.
- Mmm.
- I think Dad would be proud.
- I know he would be.
- I miss him.
- Me, too.
- I love you. I love you, too.
- Merry Christmas.
- (sighs)
- I, uh... made a recording when things got a little grim.
- It's just that... it's probably better I tell you in person.
- I love you.
- I love you, too, Dad.
- I know it's a... just a little bear.
- It's not going to make up for all the lost holidays, but...
- No, it's... it's perfect.
- You know, that... that Grimes kid, he's not that bad.
- You should... maybe give him another chance.
- ♪
- It was fun, man.
- Like old times, before you got all smart.
- It's actually the only Christmas Eve I remember.
- I'm usually drunk on Manischewitz by now.
- I miss that.
- Thank you.
- For defeating Daniel Shaw?
- For stopping the Omen virus?
- Or was it me getting us invited to rejoin the CIA?
- For saving me.
- Technically, Morgan saved you.
- Because of all the saving that was going on, I wasn't able to get you your gift in time for Christmas; however... however...
- An oldie, but a goodie.
- I hope that this will suffice for now.
- Thank you.
- Captain: Smile!
- Oh, now she'll always be able to remember her first Christmas.
- Ellie: Yeah.
- (chuckles)
- Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
- Chuck, you should know that, um, while I was tied up in Castle, Shaw kissed me.
- Well, as long as we're airing things out, you should know... that Beckman kissed me.
- Beckman: Walker.
- A word.
- Uh...
- General, I know about the, um... with you and Chuck.
- We all have to make sacrifices for the job.
- Shaw requested a meet with you.
- I suggest you don't go.
- What?
- I'm glad you came.
- I'll be locked in solitary the rest of my life.
- But one thing's going to keep me warm at night.
- Little something I put into motion that you'll never be able to stop.
- Do you remember Hungary?
- Does Chuck know about the baby?
