# Chuck Versus the b*llet Train

- Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that that you might need to know. I've had a suspicion that something's happening behind the scenes here.
- I knew it! We were right.
- Casey: X-13 gas-- short-term memory eraser.
- They'll forget the last 24 hours.
- Lester, something really weird is up.
- Last thing I remember is that there's something going on underneath the Buy More.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Nicholas Quinn.
- And I'm about to become the Intersect.  have your husband. Bring the Intersect to the San Pedro docks, pier 23
- It was a trap!
- We got to get out of here!
- Walker, no! Don't do it!
- So, we're taking the b\*llet train, huh?
- You nailed it, genius.
- WOMAN (over P. A. ): The Tokaido Shinkansen will be departing in ten minutes.
- So, Nagoya, Osaka or Kyoto, Quinn?
- What's the lucky city... ?
- The location's a secret.
- Naturally.
- I still don't know what you expect from me.
- I told you... You didn't know how to fix the Intersect.
- Yes, you mentioned that.
- Maybe you failed in the past because you didn't have my servers or my technicians, or maybe you weren't properly incentivized.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You didn't have a g\*n to your head.
- But you will this time.
- But without the Intersect in front of me, I have nothing to fix.
- I got word that your friends, Walker and Casey, just delivered the Intersect glasses to my men.
- They're en route to my base.
- You've had your time, Bartowski.
- Now it's my time.
- And don't think that you're going to get rescued.
- Your friends are dead.
- (door beeps, opens)
- (coffins beep)
- Train rolls out in seven minutes.
- We are right on time.
- Everything goes pretty smooth when you put on the Intersect, huh?
- To a point.
- Come on, we took out Quinn's henchman in a snap, and in five minutes, I had flashed on the computer and sent out those phony communiques.
- It is useful.
- You're awfully good at it.
- You thought how Chuck's gonna take the news?
- I will find the right time to tell him.
- And besides, when we get off this train, the Intersect in my head is going to be suppressed, so he'll be fine.
- Uh-huh. One last thing, just for grins.
- Name, rank and serial number.
- Oh, come on, I've had this in my head for three days.
- It took Morgan a month to start losing his memory.
- I think I have some time.
- Now, let's move, Frank.
- Relax, Casey.
- I'm kidding.
- Also took Morgan a month to be a jerk.
- Guys, I don't mean to be a jerk, but I should be in Tokyo with Sarah and Casey, not stuck here like some lab rat.
- Well, tough.
- Sarah has the same version of the Intersect that made you lose memory and deteriorate socially.
- As in, breaking up with me via text message.
- Which made us stronger.
- Ellie: So, we're trying to be proactive, determine the cause.
- We got to poke around in your prefrontal and temporal lobes, dude.
- Mm, I should be out there in the action.
- I got to go out on this mission, man! Just...
- By helping me, you are helping the mission, okay?
- If we can figure this out, then we can help save Sarah from the deleterious side effects.
- That's a good point.
- Okay, you're right.
- What does "deleterious" mean?
- Could be worse than we thought.
- Don't worry, honey, Morgan's vocabulary never really expanded beyond cereal boxes and comic books.
- I'll have you know there are puzzles on them that can be quite challenging.
- It's okay, Morgan. You're gonna get through this.
- I know, it's just, you know, I'm a trained spy now.
- I should be out there, you know, with my team, making the moves.
- Hold still, Morgan. I'm a w\*apon, I got to-- Hey, now!
- Oh, that hurts!
- That's hurty.
- My hero.
- (electronic bell chimes)
- Woman: The train will be departing in two minutes.
- Hmm.
- (chuckles)
- (window beeps, opens)
- Hey!
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.
- It was stuffy in here, you know, so I thought I'd open the window, and then thought maybe I'd escape.
- Your tricky little ring-- say good-bye to it.
- Sarah: You don't want to do that.
- Sarah, thank God.
- I knew you weren't dead. How'd you get here?
- Have to tell you about it as soon as we're safe.
- ♪
- Hey-o!
- (grunts)
- That was some major ass whupping, honey.
- What, have you been taking Strip Kick?
- I did upgrade my fighting technique.
- We'll talk about that later.
- Woman: The train is now departing.
- First stop: Yamashiro Station.
- We got to get out of here.
- Okay, let's go.
- Casey, how you doing with the cargo door?
- It's sealed.
- I'm working on an override.
- We may have missed our window though.
- Don't worry, when I get there, I'll just have to f-- uh, figure something out.
- Yeah, we'll figure it out. We always do.
- We're out of luck on the door.
- It won't let me override.
- We're going too fast.
- Chuck: Let me take a stab at it.
- Well, it looks like somebody sent me false messages.
- I don't know how you did it, but, uh, I'll applaud later.
- Meanwhile, nobody moves.
- You don't want to do that! I know more than you think!
- (coffin beeps)
- Well, you got out of that coffin; can he?
- No, we put digital locks in there.
- He'll never figure out the combo.
- There's a coupling under the train that connects to an exhaust intake.
- I remember that from a schematic that I flashed on.
- If we can get down there, maybe we can jump off.
- Casey: Easy for you to say, Walker.
- (chuckles) I think Bartowski and I are stuck on this bucket till Yamashiro Station.
- I'm sorry, did you just say "flashed"?
- As in... ?
- Shh.
- Oh, Chuck, honey, I, um, I have the Intersect.
- Surprise.
- (whooshing)

Chuck Versus the b\*llet Train
Original Air Date on January 20, 2012
- Okay.
- So Sarah, explain to me please, uh, when, how and why you downloaded the you-know-what?
- Okay, we'll talk about it in a minute, I promise.
- Train lands at Yamashiro in about an hour and a half.
- Until then, we're stuck.
- Well, I'll have Beckman meet us with CIA and Japanese Intelligence to take control of Quinn.
- I'll ask her to bring the suppression device.
- Chuck, does Quinn have any other men with him on this train?
- Wait, you-you wouldn't have downloaded the same version of the (mumbles) that Morgan had, would you?
- Okay, I did, yes, but we will talk about it in two seconds, okay?
- We'll need to lay low, keep guard on him.
- I'll take first watch, you two pretend to be gaijin tourists or something.
- Let's go.
- All right, well, now that we have that covered, there's a few more b\*llet points I'd like to go over regarding what the hell is going on, Sarah.
- That computer erased Morgan's memory.
- (sighs)
- Morgan, you're helping the mission.
- Just keep telling yourself that.
- Yeah, I know.
- I just, I don't know, man.
- I-I just feel like, no matter how much they poke around in my skull and look around in there, they're just, they're not going to find anything.
- You know? (chuckles)
- Okay, ha-ha.
- Come on. Yeah, I know.
- Well, looks pretty normal.
- There's no evident long-term effects from having the Intersect. I still don't know what caused the memory loss and why it triggered after a month?
- All right, in the month between him getting the Intersect and his amnesia, what happened?
- Castle was renovated, retooled.
- Carmichael Industries was formed.
- And then they started going on missions.
- Anything different happen on missions?
- Uh, I started wearing tight slacks.
- Any-any head trauma, concussions?
- What? No, no.
- Nobody would even close to me, okay?
- I would just flash and then bam, I dropped those baddies like they were hot.
- You would flash.
- Were you flashing before missions?
- Didn't have to. But out in the field, I was busting out the Intersect all the time.
- That's when you became a douche.
- Would you say "douche"? It seems like...
- Maybe there's a correlation between the number of flashes...
- And brain deterioration.
- Guys, that's brilliant.
- Can I go to Japan now?
- No, no. This is just a hypothesis.
- We have more work to do.
- Of course you do.
- Morgan, what's gonna make you feel better?
- Pizza?
- Eh, I don't know.
- Combos?
- You know me so well.
- Pizza Combos!
- That... was my favorite growing up.
- Pizza Combos.
- Sarah: We were surrounded.
- And so there really was no choice.
- No, no, of course.
- I-I get it.
- It's just, with what Morgan went through...
- Ellie's working with him to head off any possible complications.
- And this will be gone in an hour and a half.
- I promise.
- Okay, so I guess we just chill, then.
- It's the coolest thing in the world, isn't it?
- The coolest ever.
- Did you do any parkour? Off a bridge, onto a moving truck, and then onto a car going the opposite direction.
- Ohh, awesome!
- You know, I've been a spy for so long, and I've never felt this powerful in my entire life.
- It's incredible.
- Are you ready to say good-bye to all of it?
- The g\*n, the b\*ll\*ts, the parkour?
- I don't want to live my life in danger anymore.
- I'm ready to retire and start a family.
- Our future is exciting enough.
- Hm.
- You know, uh, we still have a good bit of time before we get to Yamashiro.
- And starting a family's not something you can just, you know, jump right into.
- Yeah, no, uh... we need some practice.
- Lots and lots of... practice...
- Allow me to set the mood, my lady.
- Yeah, we... (sighs)
- Ooh.
- I have no idea what any of this means.
- Is that a chicken button?
- Does a chicken come out when you hit the button?
- (gasps and sighs)
- (hydraulics hissing)
- Hey... well done.
- (unzips)
- Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.
- Bring it in here.
- Let's go make us some sexy...
- ♪
- Who the hell are you?
- Hey, great. We're with the Flu Bus.
- Did you get your flu sh\*t?
- I do not believe in shots or inoculations.
- Who authorized this? Morgan Grimes.
- Nobody tells nobody nothing.
- Oh, hell no.
- This place will not fall to seed on my watch.
- We have a lot of expensive new inventory here; you will not destroy it!
- It's for selling microwaves.
- Not for exploding eggs, avocados, Christmas tree ornaments, fluorescent light tubes, bars of oatmeal soap, or a football.
- Fine. Be lame. Son, have you considered that maybe it's time for you to grow up?
- Like your friend Jeffrey?
- Thank you. You're the best.
- Is it really your destiny to be a complete moron?
- (gasps): Oh, Lord.
- I overheard what Big Mike said, and I hope it sank in.
- It did not. Leave me be.
- Jeffrey, stop it. I know what you're thinking, and I do not want to discuss this topic again.
- What are you so afraid of, Lester?
- Maybe this is our destiny.
- Look, they're just dreams, man.
- How can they be dreams if we're both having the same dream?
- The fallen snow, a different Buy More?
- It's like someone tried to wipe our memories clean.
- I know, it's true. It's just...
- It scares me. We can't be scared.
- We have to figure out who would want to scour our minds, and why.
- I think better when I'm blowing up avocados.
- There are mysterious happenings around here, and we can't ignore them anymore.
- Lester: Hey.
- Had your flu sh\*t? Uh, yeah. Thanks.
- How about you get another, or I will k\*ll you right here?
- Don't make a sound.
- Did you see that?
- In my previous state of impairment, I wouldn't have cared or noticed that Grimes's woman-- forgive me, not PC--
- Grimes's significant other was just taken at g\*n.
- The newly unimpaired you is a master... of the obvious.
- This is the call.
- We'll find the truth, even if we have to face mortal danger.
- Okay.
- (horn blowing)
- (sighs)
- Cherry blossoms.
- Quinn: Colonel, would you mind opening the lid for a moment?
- I'd like to discuss something with you.
- Not interested.
- Oh, you can keep your g\*n on me.
- I won't try to escape. In fact, there won't be any need to.
- Your daughter's name is Alex McHugh, correct?
- If you want her to live, do exactly as I say.
- Dad?
- I'm okay, but they have g\*n.
- And now the picket fence.
- See?
- I haven't forgotten anything.
- Mm-hmm.
- And perhaps... this little man.
- Or wo-man... (giggles)
- ... someday.
- Someday.
- (phone buzzing)
- It's a text from Casey.
- He needs a break.
- This is gonna be so good.
- Oh, oh, ooh.
- Hey, Casey, what is going on? Where's Quinn?
- His men have Alex.
- Casey: I'm gonna need you to follow me.
- Sorry. I have no choice.
- I'm gonna need you two to follow me now. Come on.
- Do what I say, and no one gets hurt.
- Casey: Do what I say, and nobody gets hurt.
- If you fight, Quinn (over comm): or try to run, my sweet little daughter gets her head blown off.
- And really sell that one, Colonel.
- (sighs)
- If you fight, or try to run, Alex gets her head blown off.
- Now, move to the control panel and shut down the dining car.
- I want some privacy.
- Go to the control panel, Chuck. Open it.
- Move. Okay...
- Shut down the dining car.
- Upper left.
- Hit it. (chimes)
- WOMAN (over PA): The dining car is closed until further notice.
- Innquay say onway ommscay.
- Enough of the kabuki!
- Quinn: Move it out.
- Let's go.
- (barely audible): Chuck.
- Text Morgan.
- Tell him to get Alex to safety.
- Do it.
- "Alex in danger.
- Get her to Castle ASAP. "
- What is... ? No.
- She's all good, guys. She's with us.
- No, she's not.
- She went up to the Buy More for Pizza Combos.
- She should be back by now.
- Wait a minute. Hold on a second. What do you... ?
- (typing)
- Well, she's not in the Buy More.
- Someone's taken her.
- Okay, we got a situation here.
- (starter grinds, engine stalls)
- (starter grinding)
- I don't know what you want from me.
- I want you to shut up.
- Ron, what the hell's the holdup?
- I don't know, it just won't start.
- Well, we can't exactly call for a tow.
- So we'll wait for instructions.
- If the order comes to k\*ll her, we do it here.
- I'm not walking across this parking lot with a g\*n in her ribs.
- Exactly what did you do?
- Sugared their gas t\*nk.
- It's an oldie, but a goodie.
- Man, I haven't shugged a t\*nk in... ds.
- Anyway, now that they are incapacitated, in a mobile sense, we need a plan.
- It should be keen and clever, Mm-hmm. utilizing our unique talents.
- Do we have any of those?
- I think you are uniquely wasteful and destructive.
- Let's build on that.
- (whooshing)
- Think Casey has a plan?
- I don't know; he's not letting on.
- We don't really know what's around that corner.
- But we can handle it, right?
- Of course. It's just...
- The end is so near, you can taste it?
- I want that house and dog and baby, Sarah.
- Me, too.
- Okay, let's wrap this up, take out Quinn and save Alex.
- Save the day.
- Quinn said, stop whispering like fourth-graders.
- Ah.
- Uh... tea?
- No?
- I'll get to the point.
- I want my Intersect technology, and someone has stolen it.
- Release Casey's daughter, and we'll give you the glasses.
- You mean these?
- I had the Colonel fetch them.
- Worthless.
- But then again, you know that, because one of you... has the Intersect.
- Sarah: Then you know you're outmanned.
- Casey's not gonna fire at us.
- He may.
- If I don't call my men on the half-hour, his little girl gets sprayed with b\*ll\*ts.
- That half-hour's up in two minutes, Quinn.
- I brought them here.
- Make the call.
- Uh-uh-uh.
- I have something I want to say, first.
- You're gonna help me.
- A pristine version of the Intersect is available.
- It's in a government facility.
- You're going to find it and download it onto these glasses.
- Time's up, Quinn.
- Call your men off my daughter.
- Do it.
- Hey, it's Quinn.
- Uh, yeah, the little lady gets another half-hour.
- You happy? That's all I need.
- Half hour's an eternity.
- I'll come up with some way to save her.
- Ooh...
- Walker, pull up!
- Sarah, we might need to trade him for Alex!
- No!
- Maybe he hit that station, the one you were talking about. Maybe...
- I don't know what happened. I just couldn't stop.
- (yells) God!
- (screaming)
- Sarah!
- I don't know what happened.
- I wanted it to stop, and I couldn't; I just kept flashing.
- God, I screwed up so bad.
- No, no. No-no-no-no-no.
- Hey, this is not your fault, okay?
- Look, Casey is working on a plan with Morgan as we speak, and Ellie's working on the Intersect.
- I'm sure she'll think of something.
- I didn't want to flash a second time, Chuck.
- I don't have control of it anymore.
- (cell phone buzzes)
- Sis, talk to me.
- The amount that Sarah's been flashing is directly compromising her motor control, causing the migraine, which could be cranial pressure, so we don't want it exacerbated at all.
- Is that what caused Morgan's memory loss?
- I'm pretty certain.
- He barely flashed for a month, and then when he started going on missions, the numbers jumped.
- How many times before he started feeling the effects?
- Well, he didn't have a specific amount, but it was a few times a day. What about Sarah?
- Baby, how many times have you flashed?
- 40 times.
- In two days?
- That intensity level in such a short period has to be the cause.
- Okay, okay, the fix for now until she can stop flashing: She has to get to me or General Beckman so we can suppress the Intersect, get her an MRI.
- Listen, Ellie, Sarah said that she can't control when she flashes.
- Okay, that's a problem.
- We have to, we have to think.
- Think, Morgan!
- Can you sneak up on the Flu Bus without being seen?
- Casey, listen to me. We're coming at this blind.
- We don't exactly know what they got in there w\*apon. You sure you don't want to just call in the CIA? There's no time!
- I have an idea.
- Devon's gonna be the magnet.
- You, Morgan, you're gonna pick a fight.
- A firefight.
- A f... a firefight?
- First thing that you have to do is, you have to blindfold Sarah.
- She can't react to what she can't see.
- Then, Chuck, I think that there might be a way for you to build a suppression device.
- It's a real long sh\*t.
- I'm in the mood for a long sh\*t.
- General Beckman delivered me the program for the suppressor.
- Maybe I can download it, e-mail it to you.
- If I did, could you build something and deliver it to Sarah?
- Not exactly.
- What if, one last time, we just flashed... ?
- No way! Absolutely not!
- Baby, what if that's the one that does the real damage or k\*ll you?
- Look, all I need is a laptop, a PSP and some virtual reality glasses.
- If I was in a Buy More, I'd have it all in ten seconds...
- Wait. We have got something better than the Buy More.
- We have a train full of Japanese people.
- Quinn's thugs are expecting a call in 19 minutes.
- When it doesn't come, they're gonna k\*ll Alex.
- And you are not gonna let that happen. Clear? !
- Crystal. I will not let my last words to Alex be a demand for Pizza Combos.
- Go to my Crown Vic.
- Devon! Dev...
- (women laughing)
- Captain: Wow. Casey rolls strong.
- Like, raring-for-the- Apocalypse strong.
- Casey: The case in front of you, open it.
- Put in the comm device, sync it to my phone. Do it.
- Okay, we're hot, boss.
- I'm gonna talk you through this.
- Grab a r\*fle, the Sig and a survival kn\*fe.
- Leave the heavy stuff.
- You'll just blow yourself up.
- Yah!
- Just a few more minutes more, and everything's gonna be good.
- Hang in there.
- Ellie: All right, Chuck, I'm gonna start sending you the file.
- And as soon as it's complete, put the glasses on Sarah.
- It should run right away.
- Chuck: It's coming in strong, El.
- You're gonna be all right, Sarah.
- Chuck, I didn't want to say anything before, but... but this whole time you've been talking about Alex and how she's in danger?
- Yeah? Why?
- I don't, um...
- I don't remember anybody named Alex.
- Do you remember this?
- Yeah. I wouldn't forget that.
- Everything's gonna be fine, okay?
- Casey: Of course it is.
- It's gonna be fine, Sarah.
- You're gonna be fine.
- (cell phone buzzes)
- Casey, we are ready to roll.
- Okay, Morgan, listen up.
- You find an some cover 20 meters from the target. Got it?
- Okay, I see a Civic that might serve our purpose.
- Which is what, exactly?
- Devon's gonna call them out.
- And you, Morgan, you're gonna do some sn\*per work.
- Some wet work. Got it?
- Just so you know, I've never sniped in my life, wet or dry.
- Just remember, you're sniping for Alex.
- For Alex. I'll snipe for Alex.
- Yeah, you got it.
- You ready? Hell, yeah! All right.
- There's some wind kicking up here.
- I'll probably have to overcompensate.
- Probably about 30 degrees.
- Don't nudge a guy when he's sniping!
- Oh, man!
- I can't believe we're this terrible. Yeah, you are.
- Ron: Hand over the r\*fle, little man. Morgan?
- Let's go! (grunts)
- Easy! I'm not your little sister!
- Morgan!
- Casey: Morgan, what the hell's happening?
- Casey: Morgan!
- Hello?
- Who the hell is this?
- I might ask you the same question, little earling.
- Lester? Lester Patel? !
- Maybe...
- Hey, Morgan was taken.
- Jeff and Lester are my only option.
- Look, I know this sounds crazy, but I've worked with those guys for years.
- They may seem like botulism v\*ctim, but they're loyal.
- They can do it.
- (grunts)
- Lester, now I'm gonna tell you something I never dreamed I'd tell you, never dreamed I'd have to tell you, but the situation is extreme.
- This is Colonel John Casey of the National Security Agency.
- That is so funny. There's a John Casey who works at the Buy More.
- That's me, you idiot!
- I'm NSA.
- Sarah Walker, Chuck Bartowski, they're CIA.
- They are so not.
- They are so so, you colossal dope!
- Now...
- I need you, my daughter needs you, and your country needs you.
- Canada?
- Patel, listen up.
- You do what I tell you, I'll make you a hero.
- It's the call.
- Go to my Crown Vic.
- Casey: Each of you grab a p\*stol.
- Leave the big stuff.
- (passengers clamoring)
- (women screaming)
- (grunting)
- The call never came from Quinn.
- We'll k\*ll them all and leave the bus.
- Her first.
- Don't you touch her!
- Or what?
- JEFF (over P. A. ): Attention, Flu Bus.
- We have tapped into your internal public address.
- We are armed and dangerous and suggest you surrender immediately. Over!
- Who the hell is that?
- I have no idea.
- But somebody's getting ready to lose a limb.
- We appreciate that you, too, are armed.
- But we have heat vision, infrared scopes, laser guidance system and armor- piercing b\*ll\*ts. Over!
- I think this is where we should get down.
- Nobody has all that. It's a bluff.
- You're g\*n, outmanned, out... side.
- And it's a lovely day.
- So throw down your g\*n and nobody gets hurt.
- You're the one who should be worried about getting hurt.
- Uh!
- Behold the flame of destiny! Ha-ha!
- (laughing)
- What he said.
- Boys, we cannot thank you enough.
- How do we begin to even repay you?
- There is a way.
- Honesty.
- We know that there is something going on.
- Something spy... ish.
- We need the truth at this point.
- Come on.
- Yeah, you do.
- Gentlemen, follow me.
- Dad, don't worry.
- I'm fine. I promise.
- Morgan and Devon were great, but...
- This is so cool! My m\*ssile Command.
- ... those guys that you talk about, the ones that give you nightmares--
- Jeff and Lester-- (groaning) yeah, they were the real heroes.
- It's a miracle.
- Morgan: Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, yeah, no, no, no.
- I got the whole thing on. Dangerous!
- When are you coming back?
- We're on our way.
- (electronic trilling)
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Problemo.
- Alex, I'm going to call you back.
- So glad you're safe.
- Internet went down. Well, maybe it's nothing, but if there's one thing I know, it's how to fix an Internet connection.
- The control panel is between the last passenger car and the dining car.
- I remember that from my prep flash.
- Easy peasy.
- Keep your guard up.
- (beeping)
- It's been tampered with.
- This is not good.
- (speaking Japanese)
- No. Hey, uh... hey.
- I'm... I'm Burbank Buy More, so I...
- (grunting)
- (riders screaming, murmuring)
- A little warning.
- The only thing I can't b\*at down is the Intersect itself, but I've studied the program obsessively.
- You know, I've done a little training myself, Quinn, so let's rumble.
- I can hear you pacing.
- Bartowski's really taking his time.
- What are you thinking?
- Nothing. He's probably just goofing off.
- You check on him, or I will.
- I'm going.
- (grunting and groaning)
- Casey: Freeze! Now!
- Put it down, Quinn.
- Down.
- Two on one-- that's not fair.
- How do I even things out?
- You move, he dies.
- Just let him go, Quinn, okay?
- It's over. You're on a train.
- Where are you going to run to?
- I'll figure something out.
- It was never meant to be like this, Bartowski.
- You weren't meant to get involved.
- And until that Intersect is mine, this is never going to end... ever!
- (g\*n fires)
- Sarah: Chuck, what's happening? Chuck, come on.
- Chuck: We're searching the train for Quinn.
- Chuck, he's heading towards the baggage car.
- Sarah, stay put.
- Step away from the console, Quinn.
- (grunting)
- Chuck: Sarah!
- Focus on your... on your fighting abilities, okay?
- Keep your emotions even.
- Do not flash! I'll try, Chuck.
- You won't survive this one, Quinn.
- This is over.
- For good. (g\*n fires)
- (thud)
- Sarah!
- Is it?
- (groaning)
- Chuck: No!
- No! (grunts)
- Maybe not over... quite yet.
- (rapid beeping)
- Chuck: Open the door, baby!
- See if you can open the door.
- Chuck: No!
- Sarah!
- Sarah!
- (alarm whooping)
- (clunking)
- Chuck: No!
- No! Sarah! No!
- No! Sarah!
- Sarah!
- You're up.
- Good.
- Let's get started.
- Quinn, this isn't just going to end here.
- Shh. Don't.
- This is going my way from now on.
- No more screwups, no more left turns.
- The Intersect in your head is rotten.
- We're going to remove it with a suppression device.
- And then I'm sending you on a new mission to retrieve a pristine version of the program.
- I'm not working for you.
- You are.
- Until I get what I want, you're my soldier.
- Now...
- I know you lose memories when you flash.
- These, for want of a better term, are flash cards.
- They may look like random images to someone who doesn't have the Intersect, but to you, they're... stimulants.
- What are you saying?
- (screams)
- Until I get what I want... you're mine.
- (screaming, groaning)
- (Sarah screaming)
- ♪
- (screaming)
- (electronic trilling)
- Hey, bro.
- Please... please try to eat something, okay?
- I'll eat when I know Sarah's all right.
- Quinn said he needed Sarah to steal Intersect technology from a government facility.
- I need to figure out which one.
- I get it. I know.
- Hey, it's going to happen, Chuck.
- All of it. I promise.
- So close I can taste it.
- Casey: Hey.
- She set off her emergency beacon.
- She's close.
- Morgan: What did I tell you? See?
- ♪
- We'll get Sarah, Chuck.
- I know.
- Morgan: Okay, guys.
- We got a lock on Sarah.
- The signal is strong.
- (paper crumpling)
- We'll find her.
- We'll find her.
- (knock at door)
- QUINN (chuckling): Whoa, Sarah.
- Sarah, Sarah, easy, girl.
- Who are you?
- Nicholas Quinn, your handler.
- We've only known each other for the past five years.
- I guess you're not all back yet, huh?
- What do you mean?
- Well, you took a nasty blow to the head.
- A week in the hospital.
- Any of that ring a bell?
- Japan?
- The b\*llet train?
- No?
- Well, doesn't matter.
- I'll fill you in on the details.
- If you're fit for duty.
- I am.
- Good.
- Orders are in.
- Recognize this face?
- Never seen him before.
- He's the reason your last mission went south.
- What are my orders?
- Your orders are to k\*ll Chuck Bartowski.
