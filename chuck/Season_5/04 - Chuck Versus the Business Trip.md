# Chuck Versus the Business Trip

- Hi I'm Chuck.
- Here are a few things that you might need to know.
- Ever here of carbon monoxide? Stop sleeping in your van, Jeff.
- I'm seeing things clearly for the first time in a long time.
- Are you high?
- Morgan, the Intersect that you uploaded, there's something wrong with it.
- There was some kind of Trojan horse hidden in the software.
- That's why you're not acting like yourself!
- You've text-messaged a breakup with my little girl?
- I can do better.
- Morgan told anyone who wanted to hear he had the Intersect.
- Decker wants Morgan dead.
- (beeping)
- (beeping)
- Stop!
- (Chuck gasping)
- Chuck...
- Chuck, what the hell, man? !
- Morgan, you stay away from douche-cycle, okay?
- We've gotta get you back to Castle now.
- The CIA knows you're the Intersect.
- You have a hit out on you!
- Yeah. Oh, my God. Yeah-yeah-yeah. Let's go Let's go. Don't freak out, though, okay?
- I am still the Intersect.
- Not to mention I happen to stand by my Montracer's coolness factor. Please, okay?
- I'm just gonna grab some...
- No, no!
- Yes, I agree that it is okay to freak out.
- Thank you.
- Morgan, the only reason there's a hit on you is because you got the Intersect in your head.
- Chuck: So we just need to get it out of your head, let the CIA know it's over, and you'll be safe.
- And a moron again.
- Is Ellie working on something?
- Sarah: No, we, uh... called in the big g*n.
- (video games trilling)
- So shocked you people are running out of money.
- m*ssile Command is a part of our process.
- All right, let's clean up this mess.
- Are you ready, Mr. Grimes?
- Yes, ma'am. Let's do it.
- Let's get this mind-melting, assassination-producing thing out of my head.
- Don't worry, buddy, just so sit back, relax, breathe.
- (exhales) So that's it?
- It's, it's really over? Superhero no more?
- Okay, all right, if you're absolutely sure this is the only way.
- Morgan, look, trust me, I know how you feel, I do, okay?
- The Intersect is a lot of fun.
- But this is all for the best.
- I know. I know. I do.
- Can I just do one last thing first?
- You ready, buddy?
- Ready.
- ♪ ♪

- (sighs) Wow.
- Man, I miss the Intersect.
- Okay, let's do this.
- Bye, Captain Morgan.
- (beeps, whooshing)
- Okay, okay, wow, yeah, yeah.
- You all right?
- Fine. Yeah, great.
- (groans)
- (gasps)
- That was for dumping Alex.
- I get it! I get it!
- And the first thing I'm gonna do is apologize to her, okay?
- But do I need to remind you that my mind was melted?
- How's your memory, buddy?
- You remember Die Hard, Star Wars,
- Chewie, Yoda, "Yippie Ki-Yay"?
- Sorry, dude, no, it all kinda sounds like gibberish.
- It is.
- Well, I feel fine otherwise, you know?
- I guess my brain just got rid of the unimportant stuff.
- Which there seemed to be plenty of.
- General, how long will it take to call the hit off?
- I'll contact you when he's clear.
- Until then, Grimes, stay down here.
- And the rest of you, don't make a mistake like this again.
- Thank you, General.
- Stop playing with government toys.
- You have plenty of your own.
- Captain: And we lower the babies to our chests as we breathe in... and blow it out as we raise 'em back up.
- In... out...
- In... out...
- Oh, hey, guys!
- Grab a mat, join baby yoga.
- We can share Clara.
- We'd love to, but we're kind of in a rush.
- Hey! Hey, baby Clara!
- How's my favorite niece in the world?
- Clara is a rad yogi.
- You know, I probably shouldn't say this, but she's a way more grounded breather than these other jokers.
- Wow. Well, looks like you're really enjoying paternity leave.
- I have adjusted 100%.
- I could do this forever.
- Let's go ahead and put our babies into a teeny downward puppy. Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hey, there's Superdad's missus.
- Uh, yes, Devon is really taking to the stay-at-home daddy thing.
- He's gotten into mommy groups that wouldn't even call me back.
- Hmm.
- Well, you're lucky he's willing to stay at home.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm a happy lady.
- Well, happy lady, have a great day at work.
- Thanks. Have a good one.
- Bye, Clara.
- Captain: Say, "Bye, Mommy. "
- Bye...
- Man, how great are Ellie and Awesome, huh?
- They're just a nice, happy, normal couple.
- Yeah, they are.
- We aren't all that normal, are we?
- No, no, not really, but we're happy and we're nice.
- It's just, you know, my best friend is being hunted; his brain almost turned to mush.
- I haven't slept in nearly a week because our family business is is on the brink of bankruptcy.
- And we're spies who aren't allowed in the CIA.
- I just, I just think you know, maybe we're at a fork in the road.
- Well, you want, you want to not be spying?
- I just wonder what it'd be like to be a normal married couple.
- Regular 9:00 to 5:00's, more taco nights, less evil cabals?
- Look, I know things have been a little crazy right now, but Morgan's gonna be fine, and we're gonna figure out this whole free-agent spy thing.
- Even now that we don't have the Intersect?
- Yes, even now.
- ♪ ♪
- Mmm... mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm! Here we go.
- Here we go.
- (phone rings)
- Oh, no.
- Most of the assassins have been called off.
- "Most" of the assassins? Okay, good.
- That's like getting "most" of the brain tumor.
- I don't understand what the problem is, General.
- The problem's name is "Decker. "
- Beckman: That's right.
- The order originally came from his desk.
- He's already ousted us from the Agency.
- What's his problem? He's not done with us.
- Perhaps we should...
- Good afternoon. I hear we're having the most unfortunate little k*ll order mix-up.
- Don't you ever interrupt my feed again, Decker.
- I am still your superior.
- Decker, what's going on?
- Morgan is Intersect-free. Call off this hit.
- Oh, I really do want to.
- But unfortunately, and probably not accidentally, I also sent the order out to one outside contractor.
- One who can't be recalled.
- It's sort of his "thing. "
- It's, uh, codename "Viper. "
- The Viper? !
- He goes completely dark once he's cashed the check.
- Decker: Which, sadly, he's done.
- What does he know?
- Just the name Morgan Grimes. That should do it.
- That's all he needs.
- The Viper's never had an uncompleted mission.
- Decker: Why don't I leave you all with a little look-see at some of his famous k*ll?
- So many dead people.
- I'm gonna be down here for the rest of my life.
- And I have all these broken relationships I need to fix upstairs.
- Don't worry, buddy.
- Your name's not gonna be on that list.
- No way. We're on it.
- Yeah, leave it to the three friends you recently stabbed in the back.

- Marked for dead. Kinda sexy.
- It's not terrifying. Why?
- 'Cause my big bad spy friends are gonna take care of it.
- That's right, buddy, nothing to worry about.
- All we have to do is lure out this Viper creature and neutralize him.
- Look, there's no reason why we can't reason with him.
- You know, the man's just doing a job.
- There's no vendetta involved.
- Maybe we can talk to him, contractor to contractor.
- Like normal people.
- (laughing)
- (laughs) Oh, man!
- Jeffrey, you're not noticing I'm doing something interesting here, buddy?
- Oh, sorry. What's up?
- Okay, so, listen, as you know, the big Salesman of the Year convention is taking place this weekend in Riverside.
- But you never sell anything.
- You just eat Pirate's Booty and watch large- lady pornography.
- I'm aware of that, but I rigged it so that every employee's sales this quarter have been logged under my name.
- My friend, I'm going to be up to my eyebrows in popcorn shrimp and some sweet Inland Empire lady parts.
- But what about the rest of us?
- Like, what if I wanted to go?
- No, no, you don't.
- You like being number two.
- I made you number two, man.
- I don't think I do.
- You do. Stop spewing nonsense.
- Sometimes I think you are a bad person.
- Now, undo what you've done.
- I know you'll feel better if you earn this on your own.
- Son, are you reading a book?
- Yes, I am.
- I'm gonna get my camera.
- Chuck: Let the reeducation of Morgan Grimes begin.
- Oh, yes, I am so excited.
- What do I start with?
- Easy. Star Wars.
- (sighs) I'm so jealous.
- Enjoy, while we sort this out.
- And don't worry, the Force is strong in this one.
- Ah, no idea what that means, (cell phone rings) but I'm pumped.
- Well, have fun.
- Okay, all right. Hello?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Casey, Casey.
- Want to watch Star Wars with me?
- Uh... no. No, but hey, don't start with A New Hope.
- Old ones, nobody likes that.
- Phantom Menace. Everybody loves Phantom Menace.
- Hey, you're all right.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, sure.
- The Phantom Menace.
- Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.
- I'm sorry, who is this again?
- Jeffrey. Jeffrey Barnes.
- You know, from the Buy More. Oh!
- Hey... Jeff!
- Wow. You sound... normal.
- We really need a decision on who will be chosen to go to the Buy More Salesman of the Year weekend in Riverside, and our manager cannot be located.
- Huh.
- You know, let me, uh, let me call corporate, and I'll let you know.
- Great. Thanks, Chuck.
- Bye.
- I know how to find the Viper.
- Chuck: So, I've talked to corporate, and it turns out that the Salesperson of the Year and winner of the coveted weekend in Riverside, California, is...
- (sighs)
- Morgan Grimes! (clapping)
- Are you pulling my considerable chain? !
- Grimes has barely shown his face in weeks!
- I love the boy, but it's true.
- No, no, no. Guys, guys, guys!
- Do you not see what's happening?
- This is a fix!
- Lester: It's obviously fixed.
- Now, you know what?
- I revolt.
- I revolt! Who's with me? !
- Other Employees: Yeah!
- (employees cheering)
- Li-Listen, I'm disappointed, too.
- But aren't we all still lucky to be here?
- Working in a great place, in a down economy?
- Surrounded by our great-looking Buy More co-workers?
- Selling fine goods to the few people who haven't discovered Amazon.
- So what if we just use this as a wake-up call and vow to work even harder for the next year?
- Employees: Yeah!
- (employees murmuring approval)
- Chuck: This is...
- (chuckling): I don't know what this is, but I-I like the new work ethic, Jeff.
- You keep that up.
- I gotta go.
- (employees cheering)
- Chuck: So, here's the plan:
- We send Morgan to Riverside.
- We make it as public as possible, so that the Viper hunts him down.
- But before he can strike, we do.
- And after all this is over, Morgan can be just a regular guy again.
- Morgan: Okay, yeah, put myself out there, allow myself to be hunted.
- Mm.
- Yeah.
- Now, not to sound like a baby, but without the Intersect, it does seem a bit more... terrifying.
- It won't be as hard as you think. (pats back)
- (indistinct chatter)
- Hi.
- I'm Morgan Grimes.
- (computer beeps twice)
- Oh, look at all these nice people.
- Wonder which one is trying to k*ll me.
- (microphone feedback squeals)
- Hello, Buy Most-ers!
- (crowd cheering)
- And welcome to all the salespeople of the year.
- Now, I say "salespeople, " because some of you are even ladies.
- So, good for you.
- Another crack in that ceiling.
- We're going to have to get that thing fixed.
- I'm just joshing, just joshing.
- Grab a yard of margaritas and get your mingle on!
- (crowd whooping)
- Well, Morgan, you ready to get your mingle on?
- So ready to get my mingle on. Thank you.
- Casey, you good?
- We're up and running.
- Remember, I need pulse bio-feedback.
- The finger-pads don't give us lie detection unless you're actually touching the subject.
- Got it. Touch the subject, see if they're lying.
- If they are, perhaps they want to k*ll Chuck.
- And if they aren't, perhaps I grab another crab-puff.
- Okay, stay alert.
- All we know is that the Viper k*ll at close range.
- That's why he's so accurate, but that only means no sniping.
- He could use poison, so just watch your food and drink intake, okay?
- Okay, he has strangled, kn*fe, drowned, and there is a pool here.
- So, you know?
- Got it. Lots of ways to die today.
- Okay. Once we identify the target, I'll move in and neutralize him.
- Yeah, not normal husband-wife conversation.
- (men chuckling) Hey, how you guys doing?
- Morgan Grimes, Burbank Buy More.
- And where are you from?
- Champaign-Urbana!
- Prettiest place on God's sweet earth.
- (chuckling) That's where I was born, and, uh, where, God willing, I will die.
- (monitor chirps)
- Yep. He checks out.
- As you know, we're all just visitors in this sweet corn festival that, uh, is life.
- CASEY (over comms): Poor sucker thinks that's true.
- Well, it's nice to meet someone who loves where they're from.
- And what about you friend?
- You're looking a little flushed there.
- You running a fever?
- No. Always get red after my ninth or tenth.
- Irish bl*od, you know?
- Just a race to see if our noses or our hearts will explode first!

- (laughter)
- Two of our Buy Morons actually contracted scurvy.

- Honey, you're right.
- Of course. Of course she does. Duh.
- It's just my stupid suspicious spy brain, you know?
- (sighs) Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
- I mean, I'm not really sure what type of friendship is founded on lies.
- But we should focus anyway.

- Suck it.
- Can I go home now?
- Yeah, buddy.
- You're good. We're not letting this guy go till he acknowledges the hit's been called off.
- Which he's being very stubborn about doing, I might add.
- Go ahead, nod your head. Do it.
- Yep, hit's off.
- No more k*ll.
- This is not how it's done. Hmm?
- Sarah: First, we have to get Decker to rescind the k*ll order, but we'll handle that, Morgan, so, you know, I think you're free to go.
- Hmm. And if you go anywhere near Alex, you're going to be on another hit list. Hmm?
- (muttering)
- (groans)
- I'm sorry, buddy. You doing okay?
- Morgan: Yeah.
- You know, I just... wish he'd give me the number so I can explain to her.
- Chuck: Don't give up, you know?
- You got to keep trying.
- He's a tough one to crack.
- You know, uh... it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.
- Mm-hmm.
- Truer words will never be spoken.
- A stitch in time saves nine.
- Hmm? Lead a horse to water.
- Just...
- (whistles)
- Sarah: Hey, I... I got to make a call.
- Jane asked me for a drink, and this is going to take a while, so I have to...
- No, no, no, no. Go.
- Casey and I can take care of the Viper handoff.
- Really? You mean, like, I can go and have an actual normal friend?
- Yeah. Babe, come on.
- We saved a man's life not having to use the Intersect; just awesome husband/wife spy work.
- Maybe we can have some normal friends, too.
- Okay. Well, I'm going to go have a drink with a friend like a real live person.
- Have a great time. Thanks.
- Jeff, you have shown incredible improvement in motor k*ll, language ability, reflexes, memory.
- It's like you're an actual person now.
- Thank you.
- I have started to see a lot of things more clearly.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mommy.
- Hi, muffin.
- Mommy missed you. Yes, she did.
- Babe, I have never seen such a perfect case study for an article on the effects of multiyear carbon monoxide poisoning.
- We could get published.
- Ellie: That's so interesting.
- Jeff, why don't you come by the hospital?
- We'll take a look.
- Let me see your belly.
- Let me see your belly. I could eat you.
- Let's go out here and see some fun stuff.
- Your woman is not happy.
- What are you talking about?
- Fresh air has made me intuitive.
- That woman... wants to be home with her child.
- She'll never say it, but it's true.
- Hey. Alex.
- I am not here to talk to you.
- I'm here to see my dad.
- Look, I just wanted to apologize, that's all.
- There's nothing you can say to make it okay.
- You are just not the man I thought I loved.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey. Hey.
- You want the truth?
- You ready?
- I had a supercomputer in my head, okay?
- And it was melting my brain.
- Keep walking.
- Normal thoughts.
- So, how do you like working private sector?
- It's hard, right?
- Figuring everything out, choosing the right small business accounting program.
- You're probably not feeling too chatty.
- Probably feeling bad we took down the best so easily.
- Probably too easily.
- We were supposed to catch you.
- Sarah, wait. Don't move.
- Oh, my God. What?
- Look, I know we're trying to be normal people and all, but if we were in spy mode, we'd probably think it was kind of interesting timing that you made a new friend...
- I'm Jane. who wanted to hang out with you immediately post-mission.
- A new friend who was as good as I was at passing a lie detector.
- Chuck: And we might wonder if the Viper didn't use a decoy, like we did,  to make Morgan feel safe and come out of hiding.
- And we might think that getting rid of his guards by, say, planting a car b*mb, might be a really great way to go.
- (beeping)
- Okay, here's a spy thought: Don't move your foot.
- Okay.
- I'm looking for Morgan Grimes.
- You have to understand this all happened a couple years ago, okay?
- Now, I can't give you names and details, 'cause it's confidential-- that sort of thing-- but there were e-mails, and there were supercomputers, okay?
- A supercomputer wound up in my brain.
- And I zoomed. (imitates whooshing)
- That's my word, not theirs, okay?
- But the supercomputer that I got was flawed, which is why all this sort of behavior was happening.
- I'm really sorry. You have to believe me.
- My brain was melting.
- You know?
- You look a little overwhelmed.
- I'll let you process that for a second there.
- Jane: I'm sure the manager's around here somewhere.
- I'll find him.
- Got to go now.
- No, Morgan. What are you doing?
- Come with me. Just come with me.
- Seriously. You always do this.
- (muffled shouting)
- You little barbarian son of a bitch.
- (engine idling)
- (gas hissing)
- Oh. Help, help!
- Help!
- Skip, pull the fire alarm!
- (alarm ringing, people murmuring)
- Someone plug the hose!
- Everyone run to safety! I'm saving you!
- I make no apologies for any of this, Jeffrey.
- I-I just needed you back, man.
- Big Mike: Pineapple!
- (clamoring, alarm continues ringing)
- (alarm beeping)
- (beeping) Yep. Yep.
- That's-That's a b*mb.
- (beeping)
- And it's a nice one.
- Okay.
- Listen to me.
- This is what's happening, okay?
- There is an elusive assassin, and she is hunting me, okay?
- You are legitimately insane.
- What? No.
- No, no, no, no.
- Please, please, look, look, look, look.
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- It's all right, stay calm. She's there.
- I know, I know.
- (cell phone ringing)
- I'm gonna rip your face off.
- Morgan: No, shh. Casey, listen to me.
- We have the wrong person, okay?
- The real Viper is a lady.
- And she's here, hunting us.
- Northeast corner of the store.
- Get Alex to the broom closet.
- You want to live, you're gonna take care of my daughter.
- Of course.
- Listen to me.
- We're gonna move when I say move, okay?
- Okay.
- Move.
- (beeping)
- (cell phone chimes) Chuck, I'm getting some text.
- Jane is in the Buy More, and Casey's locked in the castle.
- Ooh, man.
- Okay, well, tell them we'll be there in less than 90 seconds.
- Okay. Uh, you remember how to do this, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Maybe, kinda, yeah.
- I think so. It's normally the red wire.
- Or the green wire.
- It's normally the red or the green wire; I'm not really sure.
- I want you to wait in here, all right?
- Okay.
- Don't you move till I get back.
- She's after me.
- I'm not gonna put you in danger.
- Okay.
- I love you.
- You don't have to say it back at me.
- Would've been romantic, but, uh, it's fine.
- It's fine. Good.
- (sighs)
- God, I can't believe I trusted Jane to be who she said she was.
- I must have been really desperate for a normal friend.
- Oh, hey, hey.
- Don't-Don't b*at yourself up.
- And don't move your foot, really, because this is a very nasty b*mb.
- Up with the leg. Up with the leg.
- Okay.
- Up with the leg. Keep that leg!
- Up with that leg. There we go.
- There we are.
- (cell phone ringing)
- Hello.
- Jane? Jane, it's Sarah.
- Um, I'm so sorry I'm running late.
- I'm having a really bad day, and I... I just need somebody to talk to.
- Well, just come to the restaurant.
- We'll workshop it.
- No, I...
- I'm so upset, I don't think I can drive.
- Well, just get in the car, turn it on and get here.
- I can't. My hands are shaking.
- Well, honey, look, I'm really sorry, okay?
- I'm not gonna be able to help you right now.
- I got to go.
- No, no, wait. Jane, Jane, I want to tell you something.
- I-I feel, I feel really badly.
- You've been so open and honest and sweet with me, and I'm so excited to have a new friend.
- Yeah?
- (g*n cocks)
- But I've been lying to you.
- About a couple of things.
- (g*n cocks) I'm a spy.
- Boy, it feels good to say that to a real friend.
- By the way, you're amazing at what you do.
- I really trusted you.
- And I don't do that very often.
- Well, you shouldn't.
- Wait, wait, stop!
- I have your b*mb.
- Which means it's disarmed.
- Bye.
- Thanks, honey.
- I kind of thought maybe stepping into the middle of this might have been a bad idea after all, so...
- I miss knowing kung fu.
- Remarkable work.
- The Viper's perfect record has been broken.
- Uh, boom.
- Suck it.
- Sorry about that, sir.
- I'm obviously relieved the mix-up was righted.
- I would never have wanted you to complete your mission after the CIA called it off.
- I am one of the good guys.
- Right. So, in front of all of these witnesses, on a recorded feed, the hit is off?
- Yes.
- It's official, the hit is off.
- All right, our business here is done.
- Good luck running a spy business with no Intersect, huh?
- See ya never.
- He's a quippy bastard.
- So can someone get us out of this hole?
- My pleasure.
- Follow me.
- Decker took that well.
- Yeah, he did.
- I'll take care of it.
- So, we need to talk.
- Whatever.
- We're no longer friends, I get it.
- Like I care.
- I do care.
- I wish you were a better person.
- But unfortunately, you need to learn there are repercussions for your actions.
- Mm.
- So, you're under arrest.
- What?
- For what?
- Attempted homicide.
- Jeff.
- Jeff!
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- Alex: Morgan,  we're not gonna get back together.
- You told me that you were done with the spy life, and clearly you lied to me in a million different ways.
- You're my hero, but you are not my boyfriend.
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay. I get it.
- But, um, we can still be friends.
- And I'm really glad we're both here tonight.
- Me, too.
- Oh, hey. We're putting out some hors d'oeuvres, if you guys want to come in.
- Is my dad here yet?
- Uh, he's coming a little late.
- DECKER (over earpiece): You haven't said anything yet that's made me think you're still the man for the job.
- I have a reputation to repair.
- This will get done.
- You need to understand, however, that I have to protect my cover.
- Obviously. Which means...
- Neutralizing everyone who knows who I am.
- Walker, Grimes, Casey, Bartowski, Casey's daughter.
- (g*n cocks)
- You have approval on everyone but Bartowski and Walker.
- Now get it done.
- (silenced g*n)
- John Casey.
- Your life is over if you...
- (silenced g*n)
- So, tell me about your day.
- Fun parts only, please.
- Mm. Fun parts only.
- Well, this week, I had to pose as Morgan Grimes.
- (laughter)
- You would need some serious hormone injections to get a beard like that.
- Okay, okay.
- Well, fortunately for me, my wife likes me baby smooth.
- I do. My husband was the best human target a wife could ever ask for.
- Aw, this is fun.
- Talking openly about our days.
- It's the best.
- (door closes) Hey, everybody.
- Sorry I'm late.
- No, perfect timing, man-- we were about to sit down and eat.
- Here, I'll trade you. Excellent. Thanks.
- Hey, Dad. Where were you?
- Oh, just had an errand to run.
- Oh. Yeah.
- May I? Sure.
- Cheers.
- ♪ ♪
- Uh, I'd like to make a toast.
- Chuck and I have been a little sad this week that we aren't normal people.
- I've been having a hard time with the fact that I have no real friends.
- But I look around here at all of you today, and I realize that, because of Chuck, I do.
- Nobody in the world is closer than we all are.
- So, thank you and cheers.
- All: Cheers.
- I, too, have an announcement.
- I'm going back to work.
- Well, what? Wait, seriously?
- I thought you were happy at home.
- No, I was just putting on a front, you know?
- I was going nuts.
- Ellie is stepping up and taking care of baby Clara for awhile.
- Wow. Yes, well, it was too soon for me to go back, anyway.
- I missed her too much.
- Yeah. She's totally saving me.
- One more "Mommy and Me" class, I would've lost my mind.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I just wanted to tell you that you could probably, uh, ixnay on the whole k*ll me thing, because I'm not gonna bother Alex anymore.
- Mm.
- You should move back in.
- Really?
- Got you a gift.
- Come on, really?
- Indiana Jones.
- I like these?
- You did.
- Are you holding out on me? Is this the only three?
- You're not, like, keeping the good ones for yourself or...
- Yeah. There's just the three.
- Thanks, man.
- (knocking)
- Hey. I got it.
- Decker, what is this?
- We're looking for John Casey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Decker: John Casey! You're under arrest. For m*rder.
