# Chuck Versus the Bearded Bandit

- Hi I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know.
- Let's dance.
- (grunting)
- Hello, Chuck.
- Decker froze Bale's accounts.
- Castle and the Buy More are the only things that aren't frozen.
- All of our money? We have nothing?
- Payback's a bitch.
- The Buy More.
- We take Buy More's profits, put them into Carmichael Industries until both companies can make money.
- My name is Charles Carmichael, and I have one final question for you.
- Have you ever needed to subdue a Basque t\*rror1st on a Swiss train?
- Or fight your way through the jungles of Southeast Asia?
- Or take out an arms dealer with a penchant for m\*rder and ice cream?
- Well, we have.
- So, while considering your security needs, when lives are on the line, I implore you to consider us...
- It's not that one.
- It's not that...
- Carmichael Industries.
- Thank you.
- (scattered applause)
- You did great. That was great.
- Mm-hmm.
- That was good.
- All right, we have one more team presenting.
- They should be here, uh, in any minute.
- (helicopter approaching)
- What's happening?
- (people gasping, screaming)
- Wait, this is not a real attack, is it?
- No, this is our competition.
- 300 agents from all over the world-- CIA, KGB, Mossad and Interpol.
- My name is Gertrude Verbanski, and we are Verbanski Corp.
- And if we can get to you, we can get to anyone.
- (applause)
- Verbanski.
- Yeah, Verbanski.
- Sorry, kind of got carried away there.
- I thought-- this is not a bit that we're... ?
- Right.
- Uh, go ahead.
- Who is she?
- One of the KGB's most ruthless spies till the fall of the Soviet Union.
- (spits)
- Then she went into the private security game.
- And how do you know her?
- Minsk, 1995.
- I was being a patriot, she was being whatever she was paid to be.
- Wow, 1995.
- (chuckles): I was still in middle school.
- Anyway, we had an altercation.
- I ended up with a Rosewell blade in my shoulder.
- Made a nasty scar right over one of my favorite scars.
- Well, Verbanski is good.
- She took all of our potential clients today.
- Awesome ditched rock climbing to help me with the presentation.
- He is gonna be so disappointed.
- What do you mean it didn't go well?
- Did you give equal eye contact to all four quadrants of the audience?
- It was, it was great, all of your advice was great.
- Of course it was.
- Same tactics I used to woo your hot sister.
- Okay.
- Um, look, we were just a little outmatched is all.
- Well, at least you still have the Buy More, bro.
- Still cash flow coming in there.
- Right?
- (crickets chirping)
- (bird screeches in distance)
- What?
- Is that an actual tumbleweed?
- Yeah. Yeah, we put in a new home and garden section to drum up business. Just actually glad somebody put out the tumbleweed.
- (sighs): Oh, boy.
- Anyway, how was the presentation?
- Not good.
- Not-Not good.
- Verbanski Corp took all of our clients.
- Told you, you put me out there, you don't have to worry about what other companies are doing.
- Look, I know I seem like just an ordinary guy, but I am, in fact, the Intersect.
- Multibillion dollar CIA asset turned w\*apon!
- Buddy, no one can know that we have the walking CIA database on our team, okay?
- The Intersect is a secret w\*apon for a reason.
- That sucks, man.
- I have all these powers and abilities, and how am I supposed to help people if I can't tell anybody about it?
- Because, Morgan, if you do, it could get you k\*ll!
- Oh, I just zoomed.
- What?
- I just zoomed.
- There's a bad guy in the Buy More.
- Chuck: Are you sure?
- Know what we got to do?
- We got to take him down.
- (stutters)
- Just, let's take a breath here, okay?
- We got to be subtle about this.
- He's going for a w\*apon. He's coming at us.
- I'm in! I'm in! Ah...
- Not good.
- You just found out that the zoom is mightier than the sword, my friend.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. You okay?
- Oh, man, I feel incredible.
- (cell phone vibrates) Did you see that? Did you like that whole "the zoom is mightier than the sword? "
- (mutters) Hey, Casey, thank God.
- We have a little bit of a situation here.
- Casey: Listen, Bartowski.
- I just got a call and someone actually wants to hire Carmichael Industries.
- He's coming to the Buy More to meet with us now.
- We actually just met.

- (whimpers)
- Mr. Sneijder?
- We are so sorry.
- Please, take a muffin.
- What's happening?
- Welcome to Carmichael Industries.
- Uh, I must apologize for your unnecessarily rough welcome, Mr. Sneijder.
- Or, uh, shall I call you Karl?
- You want a muffin or not?
- He made them fresh this morning.
- Um, I-I just have one, uh, little question for you.
- Is there a reason why our, uh, partner thought that you were, I don't know, a criminal?
- I do work in the diamond industry in South Africa.
- We're not known for keeping our hands clean.
- Hmm.
- I don't eat bran.
- Nobody does.
- I told you.
- Listen, I've come to ask for your help on something entirely legitimate.
- We're listening.
- My little brother Wesley was kidnapped by a buyer I may have wronged in the past.
- I don't know where he's being held, but I do know he's being tortured.
- My little brother-- he never wanted to have anything to do with my affairs.
- He's a good man.
- And they will k\*ll him unless...
- We save him.
- Exactly.
- Why should we believe these people actually took your brother?
- They sent me this.
- We gonna draw straws to see who opens that thing?
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my-- that's not even on ice.
- I don't-- that's probably not gonna be able to be reattached.
- Listen, I-I know it's not a lot of money, but I'm willing to offer you $200, 000 upfront, (coughs) and another 200, 000 when you deliver my brother to me.
- And I know you don't want to help me, but please consider helping my brother.
- No one else will.
- If you don't mind, Mr. Sneijder, we'll take some time to consider your offer and check your facts.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Oh, uh... is your friend with the beard going to be a problem?
- No.
- No.
- All: No.
- You know, what Morgan did today in the Buy More could've really blown our cover.
- Look, the first couple of months with the Intersect are a big adjustment.
- Scary and exciting, your hormones are totally out of whack.
- You're really rediscovering your body.
- It's a lot to take in, that's all I'm saying.
- That's exactly why he needs a handler.
- What?
- Who, me?
- You had Casey and me, Chuck, okay?
- Morgan needs you.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Chuck. Good.
- Listen, I wanted to, uh... say sorry about what happened with Sneijder.
- No, hey, buddy, you know, look, I-I totally get it.
- It-It took me a while to be out there with the Intersect, too, so...
- It's like, uh, Peter Parker.
- The Amazing Spider-Man.
- The thing is, it took him a while, like, over a week to kind of really harness in his powers, to really get ahold of his Spidey sense.
- Right.
- So...
- Yeah.
- Uh, which, interestingly enough, kind of brings me to something I wanted to talk to you about.
- Um, I was wondering what you thought about me maybe being your handler?
- I could show you the ropes just like Sarah and Casey did for me.
- Yeah.
- Great. Yeah.
- And on missions, you know, you can still show off your... zooms.
- But for now, you know, we really got to keep the Intersect under wraps and focus on the store.
- Aloha, Chuck!
- Hello, stepchild!
- Hey.
- Like my new threads?
- I just got back from four weeks of sexual experimentation and snorkeling with my new wife in Hawaii.
- So, what you boys been up to?
- The Buy More seems... empty.
- Are we observing International Pancake Day?
- No, no, no.
- Um, business has just, you know, been a little slow.
- That's not gonna work for me.
- I need this job.
- Bolonia Grimes Tucker is not a cheap tigress, boys.
- I think we're on the same page, Big Mike.
- Not-Not having to do with your mother being a tigress.
- I wouldn't know anything about that.
- But we need something new, we need something big to save the Buy More.
- Hmm.
- I may actually have just the thing.
- Say, Miss Lady, you need any help?
- Yeah, Pops, I do.
- Do you have Betamax?
- Sho' nuff.
- We even sell VCRs, depending of course on what you're into.
- Woman: Ooh.
- And it's on sale-- only two grand. (woman gasps)
- That's a far out deal, Mister.
- But come on now, you only buying that?
- Why don't you...
- Buy More?
- ♪ ♪
- Damn, I was skinny.
- So I figure we just re-air this spot.
- Brought in a lot of business at the time, if you know what I mean.
- No offense, Big Mike, but it, it, it feels a little... dated.
- I was thinking, you know, maybe we should come up with something that showcases some of our more current merchandise.
- Morgan: Maybe what we're looking for is a, is a fresh face, uh, to kind of tell people that the Buy More, um, has something new to offer.
- Hmm, yeah.
- Right?
- I hear you.
- Everybody wants something new.
- (chuckles)
- The finger is a positive match, Casey.
- It definitely belongs to Wesley Sneijder.
- Yeah, got it.
- You were right on the location, too.
- Got eyeballs on Wesley.
- He's being held in a guarded compound.
- Well, let's just see how well protected you are.
- (duck call)
- (clears throat)
- Whoa. What the hell do you think you're doing?
- Hey, I'm just hunting waterfowl, that's all.
- What are you doing?
- You're on private property, man.
- Oh, well, my bad, then.
- (chuckling): Sorry, I didn't realize.
- No harm, no "foul. "
- Get it?
- Okay, have a nice day.
- I count at least 12 guards with their w\*apon pointed straight at the entrance. We are definitely not going in the front door.
- Well, there has to be another way in.
- If there is, I'll find it.
- Oh, I get it, he meant, he meant waterfowl.
- (chuckles)
- (phone vibrating)
- Hello?
- (grunting)
- (woman speaking foreign languages)
- Oh, please forgive me.
- It's our busy season.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Oh, yes, not many people have disarmed Colonel Casey, but I like to remember all of my victories, even the little ones.
- Have a seat.
- Uh, you mind telling me what I'm here for?
- You said you had some information.
- Verbanski Corp has a job opening.
- And?
- And put simply, I want you.
- Private security isn't a game you just try your hand at.
- I have agents in 38 different countries under 15 separate Pentagon contracts worth over $2 billion annually.
- Well, that's very impressive.
- And what does Carmichael Industries have, other than a former colonel and a CEO with skinny arms?
- What am I really doing here?
- We both know that I'm not going to leave my husband's company.
- Are you trying to recruit John Casey?
- Is that his name on that second folder?
- Let me be frank.
- I'm talking to you because you're good, one of the best, but your company isn't going to last, Miss Walker.
- You should switch while you can.
- Well, first of all, it's Mrs. , and second of all, I'm disappointed.
- I really thought this was going to be the beginning of a friendly cooperation between business associates, but if it's competition that you want, then I suggest you watch your back.
- Oh, by the way, when this whole thing ends, don't expect me to mount anything of yours in my office.
- It's just tacky.
- Chuck: All right, Casey said he wanted something light.
- He said that, but he doesn't mean it.
- Is this really the best use of our time?
- We could be doing so much more.
- A little zim-zam-zoom, some chop-socky. Morgan.
- I, I know.
- I'm talking a lot about the Intersect, but you know... I finally get it, though.
- For the first time in my life, I sort of feel as cool as you.
- I can't figure out why I can't use what I have to make this, this dusty little rock that we all have to share, well, just a bit better for all of us.
- It's a pretty good speech...
- (man shouting indistinctly) (Morgan muttering)
- Morgan, look.
- My God.
- I know.
- This is it, this is what I've been waiting for.
- What, what, what do you mean what you've been waiting for?
- (gruffly): A chance for the Bearded Bandit to come out and play.
- What are you talking about?
- This isn't a game.
- I know, but I can do this, Chuck, I can save the day.
- Do you even know what "bandit" means?
- It's like "robber" or, or "crook. "
- No, I Googled it; it's a-a fighter aircraft...
- What? I don't under... What did you say?
- (in normal voice): I-- I Googled it.
- It's slang also for "fighter aircraft, " so there's that.
- This is not a good idea, Morgan.
- Man: Open the register now... !
- (gruffly): Wish me luck.
- Morgan, M-Morgan, Morgan.
- Oh, my God.
- Are, are you a cop?
- Not even close, sweetheart.
- I'm the Bearded Bandit.
- Oh, no, uh... take whatever you want.
- Just don't hurt me. No, no, no... no, it's a slang term for fighter-- for...
- Morgan.
- Nice save, Chuck.
- That's what I'm talking about, man, we could do this.
- We could be superheroes.
- Oh, my God, I'm the worst handler in the world.
- Holy crap, Chuck, move, move, the fuzz, fuzz, fuzz.
- Ooh.
- (panting)
- Explain.
- I know, I-I know, it's just...
- Chuck, we are a legitimate company, not a bunch of vigilantes running around, fighting crime at the Circle K.
- I know that, I know, but his heart is in the right place-- I mean, that, that, that, that should matter for something, right?
- Morgan is your responsibility.
- He could have gotten himself k\*ll and the store clerk yesterday.
- That is what matters.
- (sighs)
- Look, we found the compound where Wesley is being kept.
- We've already alerted Karl.
- There's just one thing left we need to handle.
- (sighs)
- Morgan.
- You're sticking me in the van?
- Chuck, come on, dude, I am the Intersect, man.
- Okay, all right, okay, look, y-you don't want to pitch me to a few potential clients, that's up to you, okay, but, but you got to use me on the missions.
- Morgan, it's not that simple.
- But it that simple, dude.
- How is it not?
- You're my friend.
- (grunts, sighs)
- Buddy, we got lucky at the Circle K, very, very lucky.
- What you did was dangerous and letting you do that was my fault because I'm your handler now, not just your friend.
- I need to protect you.
- Man: Buy More commercial, take 28.
- It's one line.
- Can't you even deliver one line?
- Why not...
- Ugh.
- ... Buy More?
- Remind me of one of them troll dolls.
- Man: Action.
- ♪ Why not Buy More? ♪
- Wow!
- Man, I am so over this whole Jeffster! thing.
- Me, too.
- Cut!
- Just stop.
- My commercial was a hit because I was a hot piece of meat, a thing women and men wanted, which at the time was a lot less common.
- People, the store's on the line here.
- None of you have a face that'll bring in customers.
- Sookie sookie.
- ♪ ♪
- Mike, you guys got any baby pads around here?
- Yeah, uh, aisle three.
- (chuckling): Okay.
- Hello, friends.
- (murmuring)
- (whistles) That's a pretty man.
- Sarah: Casey did some recon, and the house is impregnable from the front access road.
- Yeah, and this cliff is impossible to free-climb.
- See, I told you-- sounds like a job for the old Int... A job for real spies.
- There, why don't you wait in the van?
- Don't worry, buddy, you'll be with us on the next one.
- Right.
- Unbelievable.
- Ready?
- Absolutely.
- "Wait in the van, Morgan. "
- "Yeah, wait in the van, Morgan. "
- (à la Casey): "Oh, oh, in the van, moron, hmm, grunt, grunt, grunt. "
- Casey, we're on a private line.
- I didn't want to worry Chuck, but I had a meeting with Verbanski yesterday.
- What'd she want?
- Apparently she wanted to recruit me, but I think she was really after you.
- What do you mean?
- Well, she has your g\*n on display in her office-- the g\*n from Minsk?
- She kept my g\*n?
- Oh, God, oh, God.
- Casey?
- Casey, I'm slipping.
- Casey!
- (grunts)
- Looking good, babe. You're doing good up there.
- You're doing good up there. There you go.
- Geez. What's up with you and Verbanski anyway?
- Don't worry, Walker.
- I got your back.
- Still climbing.
- Oh!
- (sighs)
- All clear.
- (in high-pitched voice): All clear.
- Yeah. About time.
- Okay, Chuck, this is all you.
- (beeping)
- (g\*n clicks)
- Oh, my God. Who are you people?
- We're here to save you.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Oh, relax, Wesley. Your brother hired us.
- He did what? !
- Whoa, , whoa, whoa, wh, whoa. What are you doing?
- We're here to protect you.
- From who?
- The only thing keeping my brother from k\*ll me are the men I hired to guard this compound.
- (alarm blaring) What? !
- But your finger?
- Yeah, who do you think cut it off?
- I'm trying to make a deal with the Feds to testify against him!
- Okay, this is a giant misunderstanding.
- We're not here to hurt you.
- Yeah, well, my men will be here any second.
- Morgan, get the van ready.
- Morgan, do you copy?
- Morgan?
- Get back!
- Morgan: Have a drilling in the face!
- (grunting)
- Nice one! That's what I'm talking about!
- Zoom!
- (shouting)
- (groaning)
- What's up, team?
- You guys need some help?
- Yes and no?
- Okay...
- Mm. Okay, just zoomed.
- Wesley's brother's not trying to save him. He's trying to...
- CASEY, SARAH & CHUCK: We know.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Maybe if the Intersect wasn't stifled in the van, we would have all known that ahead of time, and I wouldn't have had to take out all of Wesley's guards.
- Really sorry about that, dude.
- It's...
- (phone vibrating)
- Hey, Karl.
- Karl: My sat images show that you took care of the guards at the compound.
- Nice work.
- I have a team coming up the access road now to pick up my brother.
- Do you? Do you? That's great.
- That's great news.
- We'll be right here waiting for 'em.
- (laughs) Bye now.
- Karl's men are gonna be here any minute.
- Yes. (knuckles cracking)
- Well, then I'm a dead man.
- No. We came here to save you, and that's exactly what we're gonna do. Come on.
- Morgan: What? ! No, no, no, no.
- The Intersect runs from no man!
- For now, he does.
- Let's go, Morgan.
- We had a deal.
- Exactly.
- You hired us to save your brother.
- No, I paid you to extract him and bring him to me.
- Except that we didn't know you were planning on k\*ll him.
- Nor did we know you were responsible for the finger cutting f\*g. That's crazy.
- Listen, you have exactly four hours to deliver Wesley to me. Otherwise, I'm coming after you, and trust me, that is something you will not enjoy.
- And by the way, that comment card you sent with the contract?
- Well, you can consider that...
- (whoosh)
- (sighs)
- What are we going to do?
- Well, we got a fingerless guy sitting in the game room, and his psychopath brother is threatening to come after us.
- So we go to the source. Okay, we take out Karl before he gets to us.
- With what army?
- We don't work for the government anymore.
- Sarah: Well, if we can get to Beckman, maybe she can help us put Wesley into protective custody.
- No, there's no time for that. Guys, we have to act now!
- We're not going into a firefight unprepared.
- End of story. (grunting)
- (grunting)
- Kind of feel like a burrito.
- Why don't you go on a food run for us, huh?
- A food run?
- Yeah.
- Again, I am the Intersect.
- Then act like it.
- Okay, okay. Why don't I just go with you, buddy?
- And we can get a little breather while we wait to hear back from Beckman, okay?
- Don't forget the utensils.
- Thank you. Must have had one too many piña coladas on the plane, and my bl\*od pressure is just generally outrageous.
- I'm just glad I was here for your dizzy spell.
- So, listen, Devon, have you ever given any thought to doing something that involves less doctoring and more making a commercial for the Buy More?
- What?
- The Buy More needs a fresh face.
- I appreciate you thinking about me, but I'm about to go on paternity leave to spend more time with my family.
- Sure, I did some modeling for Abercrombie & Fitch back in college, but I hung up those cargo pants a long time ago.
- Hold on, son.
- I'm not talking about doing some teenage porno here.
- Look around! This is your brother-in-law's place of business, and it's empty.
- But your creamy skin and unusually high cheekbones could change all that.
- And if you are taking time off to help your family, isn't Chuck your family, too?
- (sighs)
- Morgan: I can't believe Casey sent us out for burritos.
- Burritos, Chuck? !
- I'm so tired of running errands for that man's stomach.
- Look, Casey means well.
- Yeah, but it's not just Casey, dude, okay?
- It's Sarah, too.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It just means that isn't she the one who told you to be my handler in the first place?
- Yeah, but...
- Well, did it ever occur to you that she made you my little baby-sitter to distract you from the fact that you're being sidelined, too?
- I don't know if you noticed, Chief.
- You're on a food run with me.
- Look, I'm not... (sighs)
- Look, I love Sarah, I do, okay?
- It's just, I want to make sure that she's not the one handling you.
- She's not.
- You just passed the exit for Dos Locos.
- Yeah, we're not going to Dos Locos.
- We're going to Karl Sneijder's corporate headquarters.
- Oh, yeah. Zoomed on a file in Castle.
- Oh, did you?
- And why didn't you tell anyone?
- Why would I, okay? We're going to take him down.
- No. No, no, Bearded Bandit.
- No, we are not. It is far too dangerous.
- I'm gonna call Casey and Sarah. They can help.
- They can... They can what? They can stick us both in the van?
- No. Come on, Chuck. We don't need them.
- We're here.
- Hey, they don't understand that you and I are like Batman and Robin, okay?
- Unless you don't want to be Robin, because let's face it, who wants to be Robin?
- We'll just be Batman and Batman.
- Either way, we should be out there saving the day, not running errands, or sitting around waiting for Beckman to get back to us.
- Hey, hey, hey, Morgan, look, I-I get it. I know what it feels like to have the Intersect surging through you. It makes you feel like you can do... Anything.
- Yes, yes, anything.
- Save the day, be a hero, anything, but there's a way. What are you doing?
- Here's the thing, though, Chuck.
- You don't need the Intersect to feel that way, okay?
- With or without it, you are a hero, so don't call them.
- All right, we can handle this together.
- Just come with me.
- I need you.
- (panting)
- Morgan, no, no, no!
- God. Aah! Oh!
- Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.
- (sighs)
- (click)
- Sarah: Chuck?
- Sarah.
- Sarah, hey, we're-we're at Sneijder's headquarters.
- What? Don't go in there.
- I know, I know, but Morgan just ran inside, and he's in trouble.
- Actually, you know what? We're both in trouble, because I'm going after him. Chuck, no, you can't.
- Please just wait for us, okay? Look, I'm Morgan's handler.
- It's my job to take care of him, which is why I called you, which is why I have to go help him now.
- You'd do the same for me.
- Oh, God.
- Chuck's doing a great job, handling Grimes.
- The blind leading the blind out there.
- Well, as long as we get to Sneijder's headquarters before something happens.
- Casey, what is this?
- Your team...
- They're at my brother's building, right?
- That place may look like an ordinary office, but as soon as Karl realizes something's up, he's gonna lock it down like a fortress.
- No one's gonna be able to get in or out of there alive.
- (sighs)
- Oh! Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Oh, you came. Let's go.
- No, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop.
- Right through that door-- that's Sneijder's office.
- Okay, all we have to do is find proof that he's smuggling conflict diamonds, dude, and then we grab him!
- What are you talking about? We have to go right now!
- I'm not going anywhere...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes. Listen, you are the best spy that I know, and I would rather have nobody else watching my back, yeah?
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm gonna take it slow, okay?
- Please don't.
- (sighs)
- Kamikaze!
- (grunting)
- See? Nothing to it.
- It's great. Very good. Now what?
- Casey: In the old days, we'd just call in the commandos for backup and be done with it.
- Look, if you want to work for Verbanski Corp and have a fancy DOD contract, then why don't you just go ahead?
- I don't want to work for her.
- Look, I saw her Web site on your computer, okay?
- How much is she offering you?
- Nothing.
- (engine revving)
- The only thing Verbanski's interested in is me.
- Physically.

- (horn honking) Whoa, Walker!
- (tires squealing)
- (grunting) Sweep the leg.
- Nice.
- (engine revving)
- It was a long time ago.
- It only happened once.
- Seeing her again makes it... (groans) complicated.
- Complicated how?
- (exhales) Well... you ever, uh, have sex with someone who just tried to k\*ll you?
- It was incredible. Okay, I think we should focus on the mission now.

- Wow. Good job, Indy.
- Yeah.
- Who?
- (laughs)
- Indiana Jones?
- (shouts, imitates g\*n)
- You know. Cool.
- Let's go get Sneijder. Wait, no, no, no.
- Morgan, we have to get out of here right now.
- Good rule about bad guys: if there's five to start with, then there's a hell of a lot more where that came from.
- Chuck... Da-da-da-da.
- Intersect. Handler.
- But look what we did here, man.
- Just like I said, right? Batman and Batman!
- Look! Just because you have the Intersect in you doesn't mean you don't have something to learn still.
- You have a lot to learn, and I'm not gonna let you k\*ll yourself today.
- I called Casey and Sarah...
- What? You called them?
- Karl: Mr. Carmichael?
- (g\*n cocks)
- I do wish you would have called before dropping by.
- Place is a mess.
- So... did you bring me my brother?
- About that...
- Casey: Hmm...
- Wesley was right.
- The building's already in lockdown.
- We have to get in there.
- Chuck's not answering his phone; something is wrong...
- Can't. su1c1de.
- But we have to do something.
- We're not gonna get in there now.
- Place is a fortress.
- The boys are on their own.
- Well, that is not good enough.
- I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get us in there.
- Who are you gonna call?
- I cannot believe that you called them.
- By the way, I had Sneijder right where I wanted him.
- Chuck: Morgan, we're not superheroes, we're not vigilantes, we're a team.
- I thought this one... I thought this one was you and me.
- Why are you so against Casey and Sarah all of a sudden?
- 'Cause they-they don't believe in me, they don't trust me. And it's very clear to me now, neither do you.
- Morgan... Shut up!
- I can't listen to you schoolgirls babble on anymore.
- Come to think of it, I only need one hostage to get my brother back.
- (helicopter blades whirring) (gasps): What's happening?
- (explosions)
- Chuck: Oh! Oh, I know what's happening.
- Put your w\*apon down.
- (g\*n) (yells)
- I'm sorry, one more time for clarity, and then I sh\*\*t something that counts.
- Put your w\*apon down.
- I got a couple of buddies in Moscow who would love to get you in a tiny, windowless room for a couple of hours.
- You came.
- Well, it wasn't cheap.
- (laughs softly)
- You know, some might say it's tacky hiring your competition to help you, but...
- I... I think it takes balls.
- Oh, and I'll have someone from our Burbank office drop off your bill.
- We don't have a payment plan.
- Always a pleasure, John.
- (low grunt)
- You guys all right?
- Yeah. Thank you so much for coming.
- We really needed you today.
- Yeah, of course.
- We're a team.
- Hm.
- What's with all these people.
- Oh, God, do you think something's wrong?
- Just tell me Jeff's not trying to bathe in the washing machine again.
- So this is more than just a store.
- This is my second home.
- It's the 1080-P television that I watch the big game on.
- The waterproof radio that I listen to in the shower.
- It's the industrial blender that I use to make my protein shakes that help me look like this all day long.
- It's like his eyes follow everyone in the store.
- So yeah, I guess for someone like myself, who's a heart surgeon and a natural athlete, why not buy from the best?
- Why not Buy More?
- Well... I guess we're in a better financial situation than we thought.
- Plus, Sneijder gave us 200 grand up front.
- Yeah, well, we still owe Verbanski Corp $150, 000 of that.
- Casey: Plus the 30 grand for the repairs on Wesley's safe house.
- And the climbing gear.
- The V-21 bolt g\*n.
- Gas for the Lotus.
- What? Okay, fine, I'll cover that.
- Hey, it's a start, and it's what we needed.
- (sighs): Well, it's something.
- Hey. (clears throat)
- Chuck.
- (sighs)
- I feel like I should just say that, uh...
- I'm sorry, you know, for what happened.
- Buddy, me, too.
- I'm-I'm sorry.
- I called Casey and Sarah to protect you, not hurt you.
- I'm trying to be the best handler I can be.
- I'm just new at this, you know?
- Sure. I get it.
- So, I'm not gonna be a... a spy for a while, right?
- That's kind of what I'm picking up, though. Yeah?
- Look, you have all the potential in the world.
- It just takes time, that-that's all.
- And I promise you, I will be with you every step of the way, until the day that... that you are ready.
- Yeah, I bet. I bet.
- Someday, though.
- Okay.
- I got to get to Alex's place.
- I got to see her.
- Uh, you're still in for movie trilogy night tomorrow, right?
- Sure, I'm in.
- So, Star Wars or Die Hard?
- I don't know. Dude, uh... you pick, man.
- That's more your thing.

- Intersect's going to his head, isn't it?
- Yeah, uh...
- Maybe. I don't...
- He certainly doesn't seem like himself lately.
- Today on the mission, it's like he had never even heard of Indiana Jones.
- And just now with trilogy night...
- (sighs) I don't know, maybe he's just distracted.
- (sighs)
- Grimes better get his head on straight.
- And soon.
- (panting)
- (groaning in pain)
- Hey, no, don't stop. Keep going.
- It'll just get harder if you stop.
- Sarah?
- I thought you'd still be in bed-- it's so early.
- No. No.
- Come on, I'm used to this-- us spies without the Intersect have to find time to exercise.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. So, so, uh...
- (chuckles): Quick question, since you're here.
- Did you ask me to be Morgan's handler because... you were trying to handle me?
- Because if you don't think I-I should be in the field, I just need to know that, you know? No, no, I asked you to be Morgan's handler because the job entails bringing out the best in somebody, and what better example for Morgan than you?
- So, no, I'm not handling you.
- A) Because you don't need a handler anymore; and B) because handlers can't do this.
- Okay?
- Come on.
- That's not fair!
- That's not fair; you can't just take off.
- Oh, yes, I can.
