# Talking About Sports

> What sports do you like?

Of course this is a normal way to ask, but there's actually a more natural way to ask this. In idiomatic English we use the phrase _to follow a sport_ to mean _to like or be interested in a sport_. So you can ask:
> Do you follow sports?
> What sports do you follow?

You can abswer either of these questions by saying:
> Yeah, I follow soccer.
> Yeah, I like soccer.
> Yeah, I'm a fan of soccer.

But what if you don't like sports? Just say:
> No, I don't really follow any sports.
> I don't really follow sports, but I like playing soccer.

A good place to expand the conversation is if you answer _"Yeah, I follow soccer."_ and the other person answers _"me too"_ or something similar, to then ask about what teams they support. All you say is:
> What team do you support?
