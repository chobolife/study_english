# Getting Contact Details

A simple variation on _"What's your phone number?"_ that sounds a little less direct is:
> Could I get your number?

Asking someone for his or her email address is also a little less direct than asking for their phone number.
> Could I get your email address?

If someone asks you either of these questions, you can reply by saying:
> Sure, my phone number is ...\
> Sure, my email address is ...\
> Sure, it's ...

Recently, many people use social networks like Facebook or Linkedin, or an online chatting service like Skype, to communicate. If someone wants to connect with you through one of these services, they may simply ask:
> Are you on Facebook?\
> Are you on Linkedin?\
> Are you on Skype?

To answer, you can simply say:
> Yes, I am.\
> No, I'm not.

If you respond with _"Yes, I am"_, the other person may ask how they can connect with you on one of these services.

Of course, if you're not on one of these services, they won't be able to contact you. If you still would like to stay in touch with the person, though, you can say,
> No, but my email address is ...\
> No, but my phone number is ...
