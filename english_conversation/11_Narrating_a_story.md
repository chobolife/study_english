# Narrating a story

## Conversation: A traffic accident

- Jack: Hey, buddy, what happened to you? Don't tell me you broke your leg!
- Sam: No, it's not that drastic. I just twisted my ankle. Still, it hurts a lot, and walking with these crutches is _a_ pain in the neck.
- Jack: So when did it happen?
- Sam: It was the night of the basketball championship. And the worst thing is that we lost the game and all hopes _of_ winning our title back.
- Jack: What a bummer! Sit down here for a minute and tell me all about it.
- Sam: Well, it all happened last Thursday. It was pouring down rain and also freezing. I was in a hurry to get to the gym early to chill out a bit before the game. I was all stressed out about the game when I left home, but I got in the car and started at the drive toward the gym. All of a sudden my phone rang. It was my girlfriend. She was all excited about the game and wanted to wish me good luck. I started to get pumped up and ready for the game. My girlfriend and I kept on talking when I suddenly realized that the cars in front me were stopped and I was going a little fast. I slammed on the breaks, but it was too late. The street was wet, and I hit the car that was stopped in front of me. That hard braking caused me to twist my ankle. I could hardly get out of the car _to_ talk to the other driver because my ankle hurt so much. To tell you the truth, I was so freaked out I didn't know what to do. I was thinking about the game, my girlfriend, my teammates, it never occurred to me that I wouldn't be able to play that night. Finally a cop came and made me sign some papers; then an ambulance took me to the hospital. They took some X-rays to see if my ankle was broken or not. Thank goodness it wasn't broken, but the upshot was that I wasn't going to play basketball that night. And now I'm stuck with these crutches.
