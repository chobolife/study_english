# Striking up a converstaion

## Conversation: Running into a friend

- Nicole: Hi Jen, What's up? I haven't seen you for ages.
- Jen: Nicole! Fancy running into you here. Do you have time for a cup of coffee?
- Nicole: Sure. We really need to catch up. Do you work around here?
- Jen: At the dress shop across the street. I'm a sales assitant for the time being, but I'm hoping they'll promote me to buyer after I have some experience on the floor.
- Nicole: Oh, I love that shop. Their clothes are so trendy and different from the _run of the mill_. You look fantastic. I'll bet their _sales have gone up_ since you _started_ working there.
- Jen: Well, I try! The thing is, I enjoy the work, because I love the clothes, and I like helping people find what works for them. It's actually quite _fulfilling_.
- Nicole: Good for you. And I think the idea of becoming a buyer is great. Before you know it, _you'll be working_ on your own designs. I remember how you used to dream of being a fashion designer.
- Jen: Yeah, and I think this is a step in the right direction. Now, what are you up to? The last I heard, you were about to move across country. I hope you're back to stay!
- Nicole: As a matter of fact, I _just got_ back a couple of months ago. I'm glad _I went_, because now I know I really want to be here. I'm working as a waitress right now but am hoping to get a teaching job. I've applied to most of _the_ local school districts so I have my fingers crossed I'll get something this fall.
- Jen: What do you want to teach? I've heard there are openings for high school teachers in Howard County.
- Nicole: No way! I haven't even applied there. I'll do it as soon as I get home. Man, that'll be awesome _if_ they need a biology teacher. Thanks for the tip! Which reminds me, waiting table isn't all bad. On weekends I get pretty good tips. And banking on the info you just gave me, I think I'll follow you back to work and _splurge on a_ new dress.
- Jen: Great. I already have in mind some things for you to try on.

(later)

- Nicole: Wow. I love this one. I guess I'm getting ahead of myself, but I have a feeling this is just what I need for the interview with the principal.
- Jen: And for the first day of school!
- Nicole: Thanks so much for your help. Now I'm really pumped! I'm so happy I ran into you today.
- Jen: Me, too. Let's make sure we get together more often.
- Nicole: Yeah, I promise I'll keep in touch.
- Jen: Take care. and let me know what happens. Bye for now.
- Nicole: Bye and thanks again.
