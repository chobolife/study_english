## Conversation: Helping a classmate

- Jim: Hey, buddy, can I ask you a favor?
- Ali: Sure, what can I do for you?
- Jim: I wonder if _you'd_ be willing to lend me your biology notes. I missed a couple of classes when I was sick, and now I'm totally lost.
- Ali: OK. Why don't we go to the library and copy my notebook and then go to your place and go over the lessons? I'm acing biology this semester, so I'm sure I can get your back on track.

- Jim: Oh, man, that would be a load off my shoulders. I can't thank you enough.
- Ali: Glad to help. As a matter of fact, I have a favor to ask of you.
- Jim: Oh yeah? Don't tell me you need more advice about your girlfriend!
- Ali: Well, not exactly. It's that her sister is coming up for the weekend, and I need to find her a date. Any chance you'd go out with her on Saturday night? We'd all four go to the theater, and then out to eat.
- Jim: Look. I already agreed to go to the movies with Ben. But how about if I invite her to the movies with us instead? Of course, afterward _we'd_ grab a bite to eat, but it won't be anything fancy.
- Ali: That sounds great to me. Let me see what Jessica thinks about it. And I'll get back to you ASAP.
- Jim: Good. And by the way, thanks again for the help for the biology. I think I'm on top of it now.
- Ali: No problem. Don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions.
- Jim: Thanks buddy. See you later.
