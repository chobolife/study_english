## Conversation: Selecting a company officer

- Boss: I've called you here to talk about the selection of a new director for the Customer Service Department. As you know, so far there are only two candidates, Martha Francis and Juliette Welch. First, I'd like to hear your comments, both pro and con, about Martha's qualifications for this position.
- Ivana: Well, I think Martha is the perfect person for this position. She's been with _the_ company for twenty years. So she knows the business inside out. She's conservative and serious. Plus, She gets along with everybody.
- April: Yikes! In my opinion, if she becomes director, nothing will change. I mean, we wouldn't see anything new, just the opposite, we'd keep on implementing the same programs as always.
- Katie: She isn't known for thinking outside the box. What's more, we'd start to see a current customer base fall off, simply because our competitors have enthusiastic new people and innovative programs. I'm just saying...
- Tim: I have to agree with April and Katie on this one. In the first place, Martha is too conservative. Plus, she'd hardly inspire any enthusiasm among the employees.
- Boss: Anybody else want to put their two _cents in_? OK. then let's talk about Juliette. What _do_ you guys think?
- Ivana: Look, if Juliette get this job, it will be a total disaster for the company. In the first place, her fancy degree isn't _worth squat_ because she has zero experience. Besides, we don't even know her very well. Good grief, she's only been here since March. And _to top it_ all off, we all know that she was fired for her last job.
- Tim: Really. I've heard that her coworkers think that she is a bit _uppity_, like she thinks she's the queen of the office. She's not exactly popular with the other employees. I don't think they'd be happy with her as the boss.
- Stan: Well, since I put her name up, I have to say that I see her as a very bright and _competent_ person. Still, I recognize that she lacks experience. And now that you tell me that her personality could cause friction among the employees, then I'll go along with your decision in this case.
- Boss: Obviously, we haven't found the ideal person to handle this job. We may have to look outside the company, which I don't particularly want to do. We'll meet here tomorrow at the same time. I'll expect your suggestions, and they'd better be more promising.
