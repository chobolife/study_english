## Conversation: Living with a vegan daughter

- Miguel: Say, John, I heard that your daughter has decided to follow a strictly vegan diet. How do you feel about this?
- John: Well, I was upset about it at first, but she's fourteen now, _and feels_ strongly about not wanting to cause harm to animals. She's a real animal lover. She's even thinking about studying to be a _veterinarian_ one day. She believes that animals love life and fear death.
- Miguel: But isn't it true that vegans don't eat dairy or other animal products either? I don't see how using their products hurts the animals.
- John: She maintains that the egg and dairy industries cause immense sufferings and death as well.
- Miguel: But aren't you _worried_ that she's not getting enough protein and calcium?
- John: To be sure, it's a challenge. She spends a lot of time reading labels and looking for a plant-based solutions for all the nutrients she needs. It does seem unnatural to a lot of people in our society. But she's serious about this, and I support her.
- Miguel: How does this affect to rest of the family? It seems unfortunate to me if the other kids feel guilty about having pizza or birthday cake.
- John: If that happens, we will do everything we can to put _a_ stop to it. Since _this is_ her personal decision, she is the only one who should suffer or benefit from the consequences.
- Miguel: How would you feel she stop going to parties or even if her friends _stopped_ inviting her to join them because she can't eat what's being served?
- John: If that _happened_, of course I would be upset; I would find out how she feels about it, and also point out the social consequences to her. Then we _could_ hopefully come up with _a_ solution. I wouldn't mind inviting all her friends over and serving them traditional food! But we could also include _'tastes' of_ vegan food to show them that it's not really scary.
- Miguel: I can't believe that you are allowing your own daughter to follow this drastic diet! It I were you, I would encourage her to wait until she's at least eighteen.
- John: Well, we do believe that eating vegetables is good for your health, and we're passionate about protecting the environment, too. Keep in mind that veganism is becoming more and more popular everywhere and there is scientific evidence that it can improve your health. Plus, there are more and more vegan products on the market every day.
