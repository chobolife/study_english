# Making dates and appointments

## Conversation A: Making an appointment with a doctor

- Receptionist: Drs. Manning and Sharp, How can I help you?
- Lisa: Hello. My name is Lisa Peterson. I'd like to make an appointment to see Doctor Sharp, hopefully sometime next week.
- Receptionist: And what is _it_ you wanna see him about?
- Lisa: I need a complete physical for a new job I'm about to take.
- Receptionist: Do you have a form that has to be filled out?
- Lisa: Yes, I do. And it looks like I'll need a pretty thorough exam.
- Receptionist: Can you fax it to me? _That way I'll_ know how much time to allot for your appointment.
- Lisa: Sure. Can you give me your fax number?
- Receptionist: It's 202-739-5906.
- Lisa: Good. I'll fax it to you right away. Will you call me back when you get it?
- Receptionist: Right.

(later)

- Receptionist: Hello, Lisa. This is Dr. Sharp's office. I see you're going to need an hour-long appointment, and Dr. Sharp won't be able to do that for at least another month. I could give you an appointment with Dr. Manning next Thursday, though, at 1 p.m. Would you like to take that?
- Lisa: Um... yes, that sounds fine. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the exam?
- Receptionist: Yes. I know this will be difficult, but you mustn't eat or drink anything after midnight the night before. I wish I could give you an appointment earlier in the day, but we don't have any other openings.
- Lisa: Okay. But if there is a cancellation earlier in the day, please let me know. I'd much rather come in early in the morning.
- Receptionist: Of course.
- Lisa: Thanks very much. Goodbye.

## Conversation B: Changing a lunch date

- Lisa: Hi Maria, It's Lisa. Listen, I'm not going to be able to have lunch with you next Thursday. I have to have a physical for my new job, and it's on Thursday at 1 o'clock, and it's in Alexandria. I'm really sorry. Can we make it another day?
- Maria: No problem. How about Friday at 12:30?
- Lisa: Oh dear, I can't do that either. Could you do Wednesday?
- Maria: Look, we're going to have to make it the following week. We've both got too much on our plates right now. Let's say Thursday the 24th, at 1 o'clock. Okay?
- Lisa: Perfect. We'll have a lot to talk about by then!
