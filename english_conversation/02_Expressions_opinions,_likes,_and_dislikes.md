# Expressions opinions, likes, and dislikes

## Conversation: Getting acquainted

- Lauren: Hi, you must be Sarah, I can tell from your picture. I'm Lauren, Finally we meet! So we're going to be roomies this semester!
- Sarah: Yes, I recognize you from your photo, too! I'm so glad to meet you in person. And I see from your T-shirt that you like baseball. I'm a big fan, too!
- Lauren: Well, the T-shirt was _going-away_ present from my brother, who's a baseball player. Look on the back. It has a photo of all the players on his team. They actually won the city championship this summer.
- Sarah: That's awesome. I tell you, I'm not very athletic, but I love to watch baseball even if it's a Little League game. You could say I'm a professional spectator. What about you, do you play a sport?
- Lauren: Yes, I play tennis. As a matter of fact, I have a scholarship, and I'm going to play for the university. Now tell me, what else do you like to do?
- Sarah: Well, what I like to do best is dance. I'm studying classical ballet, but I also like to dance to popular music.
- Lauren: Cool! We have a lot in common. I like to dance too. _Think you'll be_ up for checking out the local clubs this weekend?
- Sarah: Oh, yeah. And the restaurants too. Speaking of which, are you hungry? I'd love to grab a bite before _it_ gets to late. I'm starving!
- Lauren: Are you kidding me? I'm always _up_ for going out. How about trying the place _up_ the street? I'm kind of hungry of a good hamburger.

(later)

- Sarah: Lauren, what do think of our room?
- Lauren: To be honest with you, I really can't stand that dark color on the walls. It's, like, really depressing. I prefer light colors. Plus, I'd like to change the rug and the bedspreads. Do you like them?
- Sarah: No, I agree with you. They're horrible. with a couple of coats of paint and a few small changes, we'll make this room comfortable and cozy. Everybody will wanna hang out here.
- Lauren: Man, I'm so relieved! I think we're really going to _get along_. I'm going to call my mom right now, and tell her how cool my roomie is.
