# Introducing yourself and others

## Conversation: Meeting at a party

- Todd: Hi, you must be John's cousin Matt, right? From San Diego?
- Matt: Correct! I just got in last night.
- Todd: I'm Todd, John's roommate from Tech. Glad to meet you. I can assure you that I'm not anything like what John has told you.
- Matt: I'm happy to meet you too. And yes, I have heard about you! Football player, and party animal _extraordinaire_?
- Todd: Football, yes. And as a matter of fact, I do like parties. But tell me more about yourself and what you do in San Diego.
- Matt: Well... I'm more of a surfer than a football player. You know, San Diego has a fantastic coast. And we can surf all day and then party on the beach at night.
- Todd: That sounds awesome. How long _are you staying_?
- Matt: Well... I'll be here for two week. John has promised me a nonstop schedule. Kind of mix of sightseeing, meeting his friends, checking out the local scene, and hopefully, camping on the mountains for a couple of days.
- Todd: John's a good guy. And you can be sure he knows the local scene. He knows everybody in town. I'm sure he'll show you a good time. And his friends _are_ here to help.
- Matt: Thanks so much. I really appreciate that. I'm still a bit _jet-lagged_ at the moment, but I should be in good shape by tomorrow. I'm looking forward to hearing what John has _in store for_ me.
- Todd: Don't worry. We'll all take good care of you. And don't be surprised if we show up on your doorstep in San Diego one day. Ready for surfing!
