# Describing people, places, and things

## Conversation: Talking about roommates

- Eric: So, Michael, what's your new roommate like?
- Michael: Well, if you have all day, I'll describe him to you. He is quite the character.
- Eric: I don't have all day, dude. But basically do you get along with him?
- Michael: Actually, yeah. But that's only because we hardly ever see each other. The guy sleeps all day. Sometimes he gets up just to go to his classes. and then he comes back to the room and goes to back to bed. Then he'll get up at midnight and study all night.
- Eric: Really? You don't eat together, then?
- Michael: The truth is, I don't even know when he eats, or where.
- Eric: Then at least he doesn't leave a mess in the kitchen.
- Michael: No! The guy is incredibly neat. He actually leaves the bathroom clean every day. And he doesn't seem to have dirty clothes. He's _like a ghost_.
- Eric: Man. I think you have the perfect roommate!
- Michael: What about yours? What's he like?
- Eric: Well, he is the exact opposite of yours. We're a lot alike. and we're together a lot. I mean, we have two classes together and we're in the same _fraternity_, So we're really good friends.
- Michael: Sounds to me like you have the ideal roommate!
- Eric: Well, yes and no. Mine is a disaster in the house. In the first place, he always leaves a mess in the kitchen. He doesn't wash the dishes or take out the trash. Plus, he throws his clothes all over the place. Not to mention how he leaves the bathroom...
- Michael: Come on, Eric. He sounds a lot like you. No wonder _you're_ get along so well!
