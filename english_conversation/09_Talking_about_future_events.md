# Talking about future events

## Conversation A: Scheduled events

- Raj: What time does the movie start?
- Ines: It starts at 7:30, and ends at 9:45.
- Raj: Good. We can go on the bus, and get back home before it's too dark. Is there a bus stop near your house?
- Ines: Yes, it stops on the corner every fifteen minutes.
- Raj: Perfect. I'm looking forward to seeing this movie.

## Conversation B: Plans for the very near future

- Jenny: What are you doing tomorrow?
- Paula: I'm going to the beach with my family for a week. We're leaving early at 6 a.m.
- Jenny: Oh, nice! So I guess you're planning go to bed early tonight.
- Paula: Yeah, I'm gonna pack my bag and try to hit the sack by nine o'clock.
- Jenny: Good luck with that! What are you taking?
- Paula: I always pack light for the beach. A bathing suit, a couple of pairs of shorts, some T-shirts, a hat, and lots of sunscreen. How about you? What are you doing next week?
- Jenny: I'm going to stay home and catch up on some unfinished projects.
- Paula: Like what?
- Jenny: Oh, I have a long list! _First I'm_ going to clean up my office, pay bills, write letters, and take care of a bunch of paperwork. Then I'm going to redecorate my bedroom, paint the walls, and get new curtains.
- Paula: Wow. What color are you going to paint it?
- Jenny: It's a very light blue. I've already picked it out and bought the paint.
- Paula: Cool.

## Conversation C: Long-term plans

- Emma: What do you think you'll do when you finish college?
- Kim: Oh, I'll probably stay in the city _and_ look for work here. Then I'll go back home on holidays.
- Emma: I love that idea, but I'll probably go _closer_ to home to get a job. I like being close to my family and old friends. Still, life in the big city is certainly attempting!
- Kim: Well, maybe you _could_ find a job in a big city closer to home.
- Emma: Yeah, that would be a happy medium.
- Kim: Oh the other hand, since you like to travel, you could possibly get a job at another country. Do something exotic.
- Emma: You're right. I might get really bored just doing the same old thing. _I'd_ learn a lot overseas, even pick up another language. It's definitely something to think about.
- Kim: Well, I guess we don't have to decide now, since we are still in our freshman year!

## Conversation D: Predictions for the more distant future

- Teacher: What will the world be like fifty years from now?
- Andy: Just think! People will be living on Mars.
- Emily: I'll bet cars will be replaced by little helicopters, so you'll be able to fly ahead in traffic.
- Holly: There won't be any more wars.
- Julie: Women will make more money than men.
- Stacey: No way! Women will stay home and the men will do all the work.
- Joe: There will be a better form of government.
- Zack: People will have forgotten how to talk and will only communicate electronically.
- Heather: There won't be any disease. and people will live to be 150 years old.
- Courtney: That will be horrible. It will be so crowded!
- Andy: That's why people will be living on Mars.
