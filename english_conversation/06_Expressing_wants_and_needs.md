## Conversation: Looking for a new apartment

- Receptionist: Good morning. How can I help you?
- Ted: I'd like to rent an apartment in this neighborhood and wonder if you can help me.
- Receptionist: You need to talk to Shirley. She's our go-to agent for apartment rentals. Here, I'll take you to her office.
- Shirley: Hello. I'm sherlie. Have a seat and tell me what kind of apartment you're looking for. Is it just for you?
- Ted: Well, that depends on what's available. I'd really rather live alone, but if I don't see anything that works, I can share a bigger place with a friend of mine.
- Shirley: OK. First, tell me what you have in mind.
- Ted: The most important thing is the location. I want to be in the city, preferably in this neighborhood, so I can walk to the university _and to_ the metro station. I don't have a car.
- Shirley: OK. then you don't mind if there's no parking space.
- Ted: Exactly. But I want a secure building. I also wanted to have a living room, a dining room, one bedroom, and, of course, a modern kitchen and bathroom. I don't really need _all the_ bells and whistles, but I would like to have a balcony.
- Shirley: And what is your budget? I mean, what monthly rent are you thinking about, including utilities?
- Ted: I'm hoping to find something for about $700 a month.
- Shirley: Look, I can tell you right now there are now no decent apartments in _this_ area under $1,200 a month, and none of them have dining rooms and balconies. _There are_ modern secure buildings that are actually near the metro but they're at least six miles outside of the city.
- Ted: There's no way I'm going to live way out there. Do you think you can find a two-bedroom place closer in for, say, $1,400 a month? Something I _could_ share with my friend?
- Shirley: Let me do a little research this morning and see what I can find. I'm not going to tell you that it's impossible, but I can't promise anything either. Give me a couple of hours to see what's out there. If I find anything worthwhile, we can go have a look this afternon. In the meantime, I need you to fill out this form so I have contact information. As a matter of fact, both you and your friend will have to fill out an application in order to be approved as tenants. I'm assuming you want a one-year lease. Is that right? Oh, one more thing: you don't have a pet, do you?
- Ted: Yes. I'm willing to sign a one-year lease, and no, I don't have a pet. And I'll make sure my friend gets rid of his dog. _He_ can _leave it_ with his family. They have a place in the country. I'd better go give _him a heads-up_ right now.
- Shirley: Good. Be sure both you bring your financial and credit information with you.
- Ted: Right. We'll see you at noon, then. Thank you very much.
- Shirley: See you later.
