# Asking "What are you doing in this city?"

This question _"What are you doing in ~?"_ is often asked from on expatriate to another. It can mean _"what is your job?"_ but it can also contain the meaning of _"how did you get here?"_ or _"What circumstances brought you here?"_

> What are you doing in Tokyo?\
> What are you doing in Germany?

There are a number of possible ways to answer it. You could just say what you do for a living:
> I'm a software developer at Google.

Or you could say why you came to the city or to this country in the first place.
> I studied English at college, so I wanted to try living in an English-speaking country.\
> My husband [or wife] got transferred here by his [or her] company.\
> I got transferred from Manila.

You can ask the other person the same question by saying: _"How about you?"_ However, if the other person is a native of the country, this might sound a little strange. In this situation, you can ask the following question instead.
> Did you grow up here?\
> Were you born here?
