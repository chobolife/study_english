# Talking About Family

In some English textbooks you'll see thee question: _"Do you have any siblings?"_ but actually we rarely use the word _siblings_ in natural, casual spoken English. So in order to ask this question naturally, all you say is:
> Do you have any brothers or sisters?

So the other person's answer to this question will probably be one of the following:
> Yeah, I have two brothers/a brother and a sister/two sisters/etc.\
> Yeah, I have two younger brothers.\
> Yeah, I have a younger brother and an older sister.

Note that some people say _elder_ instead of _older_, but they both mean the same thing.

If the other person doesn't give details about the ages of his/her brothers and sisters, though, you can ask a polite follow-up question to show you're interested.
> Is she/he older or younger (than you)?\
> Are they older or younger (than you)?

But what happens if the other person doesn't have any brothers or sisters? There's a set of phrase for this in English:
> I'm an only child.

When someone gives you information like this and there doesn't seem to be anything else to ask, a good all-purpose reply is to say _"Oh, really?"_ with a downward tone, while nodding or just looking interested.
