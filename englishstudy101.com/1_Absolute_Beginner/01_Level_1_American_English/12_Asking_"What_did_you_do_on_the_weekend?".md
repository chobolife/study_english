# Asking "What did you do on the weekend?

In English, the most natural way to say _go out drinking, dancing, etc at night_ is to say just _go out_. As in, _"Did you go out last night?"_ In context the other person will know what you mean.

In English, it's important not to ask things too directly. If you want to ask someone if they usually go out drinking, dancing on weekends, it's best to say:
> What do you usually do on Friday or Saturday nights?

It's a bit long, but the emphasis on _Friday or Saturday nights_ will tell the other person exactly what you mean. You could also say _on weekends,_ but it might sound like you're asking about what they do during the day.

Another way to ask this is to use the phrase _get up to_. This has the implication of doing things that are slightly _naughty_, like drinking alcohol or going to a club.
> What do you usually get up to on weekends?

Asking the question in this way implies nightlife activities, so you don't need to say _Friday or Saturday nights._

A few possible responses to this are:
> I like going to bars with my friends.\
> I like going clubbing with my friends.\
> I like hanging out with my friends.\
> I don't really drinking/clubbing, so I just like [whatever you like doing instead].

A handy way to turn the question back on the person asking is just to say:
> How about you?

If you think going for a drink with this new person sounds like fun, and you'd like to make a casual invitation, bringing up the topic of what s/he gets up to on weekend evenings is a great way to do this. A natural, casual way to do this without pressuring the other person too much is just to say:
> That sounds fun! We should go together sometime.
