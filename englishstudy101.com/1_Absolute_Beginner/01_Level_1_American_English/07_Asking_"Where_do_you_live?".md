# Asking "Where do you live?"

Usually, someone will ask you where you live as a polite question after they've asked you your name, where you're from, and what you do for a living. They'll say:
> So where do you live?

This is inviting you to keep making conversation. Here's some of the most common. You could say: _"Do you know ...?"_ and then the name of the area you live in.
> Do you know Twin Pines?

Or, you could mention a local landmark. Like:
> Near the library.\
> Near the movie theater.

You could also answer by telling the person what train line you live on, if your city has a train network. Or what station is the nearest to your house.
> On the Green Line.\
> Near Central Station.

So as you can see, there are lots of possible ways to answer the question _"Where do you live?"_ Once you've told them, the other person might respond in one of the following ways:
> Oh, yeah, I know it!\
> I live near there!\
> I'm afraid I don't know it.

The other person is just being polite by showing interest, so you can reply by saying something like _"Oh, really?"_

Since the other person is asking you this question to be polite, a good way to continue the conversation is to ask them the same question in return. You can just say:
> How about you"\
> Where do you live?

Put some stress on the __you__

Asking where someone lives is a way to try to find something you have in common with the person you're talking to - so if you're familiar with the other person lives in, make some comments about it!
> That's a really nice area.\
> The park there is really pretty.

Anything is fine - as long as you don't say anything negative that could be taken as offensive.
