# Asking about Names

_"What's your name?"_ was probably one of the first questions you learned when you started studying English. I have to tell you, though, that most native speakers of English would never say this! It is often more polite to be a little indirect.

The easiest way to avoid asking the question directly is to not ask at all! Just introduce yourself, and most people will respond by doing the same.
> Hi, I'm Alisha! And you?

Let's talk about an embarrassing situation that happens to everybody: you've already met this person once before, but you've forgotten their name!

The most polite thing to do in this situation is to apologize and ask again.
> I'm sorry. What was your name again?

In the United States, it's normal to address people by name in conversaion more than once. In both formal and informal situations, it's a way to show respect or interest in the other person, and can help you make friends. It is also a great way to practice someone's name so you don't forget it!
> Ann, what do you do for fun?\
> What do you do for fun, Ann?
