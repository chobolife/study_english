# Asking "Are you going on vacation this year?

The first question you'll want to ask is if the other person is going on vacation.
> Are you going anywhere on vacation this year?\
> Are you going anywhere on vacation this summer?

If you're not going anywhere, for the most natural-sounding reply, you can say:
> I'm staying at home this year.

If you've already decided where you're going, you can reply with the name of the place and the month you're going.
> Yeah, I'm going to Hawaii in July.

But what if you're definitely going somewhere on vacation, but you haven't yet decided where you're going?
> I'm planning to go to Hawaii, or maybe Thailand.\
> I'm thinking of going to Hawaii, or maybe Thailand.

So what to talk about once you've told where you're going on vacation? Well, you can say what you're planning to do there using the phrase _"I want to.."_
> I'm planning to go to Hawaii. I want to sunbathe!\
> I'm planning to go to Thailand. I want to go shopping!

A good follow-up question to this is asking how long the person will stay there for.
> How long are you going to stay?\
> How long are you going for?

Answering this question is really easy.
> A week.\
> Ten days.\
> Two weeks.
