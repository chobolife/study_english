# Asking How People Know Each Other

Often at a party or in another social situation that you attend with a friend, you will be introduced to someone new, or someone else will join the conversation. A question that we often ask in this situation is how the new person knows your friend, and what the connection is between them.
> So, how do you know Person A?\

If Person A is talking with you still, you can ask this in a slightly different way, by including both people and saying:
> So, how do you know each other?

Of course there are many possible answers to this question, usually beginning with _"We met..."_:
> We met at school.\
> We met at a party.\
> We met through a friend.

Another way to answer this is to state your current connection with the other person. For example:
> We work together.\
> We have a friend in common.

The next logical step in the converstaion is to expand on what you've just learned.
> We met at school.
> - Where was your school?
> - Which school?

> We met at work.
> - Where do you work?
> - What kind of job do you do?

> We met through a friend.
> - Anyone I know?

Note that sometimes in the United States people call this converstaion, in which you try to work out what the connection between the two of you is, _the name game_.
