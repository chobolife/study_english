# Asking "Where are you from?"

_"Where are you from?"_ can mean many things. It can mean, _What city are you from?_ or _What state are you from?_ In fact, Americans ask this question to each other all the time to learn what part of America the other person comes from. Of course, it can also mean _"What country are you from?"_

You can say _"I'm ..."_ plus, your nationality.
> I'm Japanese.\
> I'm Brazilian.

Or you can say _"I'm from ..."_ plus, the country you are from.
> I'm from Italy.\
> I'm from Thailand.

If you're from a famous city or place, you can say that, too.
> I'm from Beijing.\
> I'm from New Delhi.

Many times, Americans won't ask, _"What country are you from?"_ Or even _"Where are you from?"_
> Where you from?

People may be a little more indirect because they want to be polite. To do this, they might ask you if you are from the place where they meet you.

For example, if you meet someone in New York, they might ask:
> Are you from New York?

or if you are in San Diego, the might ask
> Are you from San Diego?

Many parts of the United States are very multi-cultural, so asking the question this way avoids what could be an embarrassing mistake.

You can answer this the same way you answer _"Where are you from?"_ Just add a simple _"No"_ in front.
> No, I'm French.\
> No, I'm from Russia.

Since the United States is very large, people you meet may take great pride in the place or region they come from. If you ask someone about where they're from, they may respond by saying something like, _West Coast_, or the _East Coast_, or _California_, or the _South or the Midwest_. If they answer in this way, it usually means they are interested in talking more abouth their region and how it differs from others.
