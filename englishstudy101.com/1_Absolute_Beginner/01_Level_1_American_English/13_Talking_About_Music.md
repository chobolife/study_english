# Talking About Music

> What kind of music do you like?

This is OK to use, but it can sound a little formal. There's actually a more natural way to ask this, using the phrase _be into someting_. Like
> What are you into?

This means the same as _"What do you like?"_

So all you have to do ask this question is say:
> What kind of music are you into?\
> What sort of music are you into?

Now, how to answer this question? You can say something like:
> I'm really into hip-hop.\
> I really like classical music.

Another way to answer, though, is to just say the names of some of the musicians or artists that you like as examples of the type of music you like. For example,
> I like Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj.\
> I like people like Lady Gaga and Nichi Minaj.\
> I like stuff like The Killers and Adele.

The expression _"I'm really into..."_ can be used with a lot of different things - not just music. You can use it to talk about your hobbies or sports you like to play as in _"I'm really into tennis"_, or _"I'm really into soccer"_. It can be used with people, too, if you want to say you like a certain person in a romantic sense.
