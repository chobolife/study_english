# Giving and Receiving Compliments

> I love your bag!\
> I love your top!\
> I love your shoes!

This can sound a little bit feminine, so if you're a guy, you could say:
> I like your ...[item].

A normal response is just:
> Thanks!

Or if you want to be modest:
> Oh really? Thanks!

A great way to follow this up and keep the conversation going is to ask ...
> Where did you get it?\
> Where did you buy it?

The usual answer to them is something like:
> I got it at [store name] in [city name].

This is appropriate if you bought the item in the country you're currently in. If you bought it in a different country, though, it's usual to say:
> I got it in [country name].

In some countries it's considered totally fine and even polite to ask how much something cost, but in most English-speaking countries like the UK, Australia and America, this is usually considered very rude. Remember not to say something like
> It looks expensive!\
> How much was it?
