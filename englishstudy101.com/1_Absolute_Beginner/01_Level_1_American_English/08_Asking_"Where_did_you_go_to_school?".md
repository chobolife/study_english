# Asking "Where did you go to school?"

> Where did you go to college?\
> Where did you go to school?

In American English, depending on context, _school_ often means the same as _college_. If the other person is British or European, however, they're more likely to say:
> Where did you go to university?

The answer to this question is really easy! All you say is: _"I went to [University], in [City]."_
> I went to Southen Oregon University in Ashland.

If the name of the city of town is part of the university's name, like _Tokyo University_, or _Oxford University_, you can add the name of the country instead.
> I went to Tokyo University in Japan.

Once you've heard the other person's answer, it's polite to make somd kind of comment. For example,
> Wow, that's a really famous university.\
> Oh, really?

Sometimes the other person might reply:
> I didn't go to college.

In this situation, you should be careful how you reply so as not to appear rude. It's polite to not act surprised, but instead make a positive comment like:
> Oh, really!\
> Did you go straight into a job?

A good follow-up question to keep the conversation going is to ask the other person:
> What did you study?\
> What was your major?

This gives them an opportunity to talk about something they're interested in.
