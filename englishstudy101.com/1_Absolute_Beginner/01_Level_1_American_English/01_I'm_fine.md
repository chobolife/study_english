# I'm fine

If someone says:
> How are you?

You can say:
> I'm fine.
> Pretty good.
> Not bad.

Let's look at our question again: _How are you?_ You could use it when you want to be polite.

But now, let's look at some different ways to ask how someone is. These ways are more casual, and much more common.

> Hey, how's it going?

You can answer this in many ways.
> Good.\
> Pretty good.\
> Not bad.

Even though these answers mean the same thing as _"I'm fine"_, you can't answer _"How's it going?"_ within _"I'm fine."_ It will sound a bit strange.

If you're not feeling good, you can say:
> Not so good.\
> Not great.\
> Not so well.

If you say one of these, the other person will usually ask, _"Why, what's wrong?"_ to be polite. Then, you will have to explain!

Another casual, but very common version of "How are you?" is
> What's up?

To reply, use a cheerful voice as you say:
> Not much!\
> Nothing much!

Since "What's up" is just another way of saying "Hello", you can also reply with:
> Hey!\
> Hi!

A lot of the time, when we ask questions that mean _"how are you?"_ in English, we're not actually asking about the other person's health - we're only asking to be polite! You should think of these kinds of questions as another way of saying _"Hello"_ - a way for the conversation to get started - instead of actual literal questions.

In fact, when someone asks you _"what's up?"_ you don't even have to answer! Just say _"What's up?"_ in reply.
