# What do you do?

You can just say, _"What is your job?"_ This is correct English, but it sounds too direct and awkward.

> What do you do for a living?\
> What do you do?

So how would you answer this question? You could answer with _"I am"_, plus your job.
> I'm a teacher.\
> I'm an engineer.

You can also mention the place that you work at, starting with _"I work at"_.
> I work at a hospital.\
> I work at a law firm.

If you work for a big company that is well-known, you can say _"I work for"_, and then the name:
> I work for Microsoft.\
> I work for The New Your Times.

When you ask the question _"What do you do?"_ and the other person tells you their job, it's polite to make some kind of positive comment about his or her job - for example,
> How interesting!\
> That must be exciting.\
> Oh, really!
