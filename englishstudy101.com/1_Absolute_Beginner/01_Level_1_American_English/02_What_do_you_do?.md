# What do you do?

You can just say, "What is your job?" This is correct English, but it sounds too direct and awkward.

> What do you do for a living?\
> What do you do?

So how would you answer this question? You could answer with "I am", plus your job.
> I'm a teacher.\
> I'm an engineer.

You can also mention the place that you work at, starting with "I work at".
> I work at a hospital.
> I work at a law firm.

If you work for a big company that is well-known, you can say "I work for", and then the name:
> I work for Microsoft.
> I work for The New Your Times.

When you ask the question "What do you do?" and the other person tells you their job, it's polite to make some kind of positive comment about his or her job - for example,
> How interesting!\
> That must be exciting\
> Oh, really!
