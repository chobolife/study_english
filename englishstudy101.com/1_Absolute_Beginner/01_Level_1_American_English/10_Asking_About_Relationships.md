# Asking About Relationships

> Are you married?

However, this is a little blunt, and can come across as slightly rude, or sound as if you're trying to pick up the other person. There's a really important little trick you can us to ask this question naturally. And that's to say:

> Are you married, or ...?

You stretch out the sound of the _or_. This has the effect of softening the question and making it sound less direct.

The answer will most likely sound like this:
> Yeah, I've been married for 10 years.\
> Not yet, but I'm engaged.

The correct response to this, by the way, is usually _"Congratulations!"_

If you aren't yet engaged but do have a long-term boyfriend or girlfriend, this is a good opportunity to bring that up.

> No, but I have a long-term boyfriend/girlfriend.

The word _steady_ sometimes comes up in English textbooks, but this is a really old-fashioned way to say _long-term_, and people don't really use it any more.

If you're not married, not engaged, and don't have a boyfriend ro girlfriend, then you can reply:
> No, I'm single at the moment.

This _at the moment_ is another way to soften what you're saying and make it sound less blunt.
