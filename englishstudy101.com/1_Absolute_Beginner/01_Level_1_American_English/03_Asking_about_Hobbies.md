# Asking about Hobbies

You've probably seen the question, _"Do you have any hobbies?"_, or _"What are your hobbies?"_ in an English textbook before. However, **native English speakers almost never use the word _"hobbies"_ when asking about them!**

Much more natural ways to ask the same question are:
> What do you do for fun?\
> What do you do in your free time?

How would you answer this question? The easiest way is to say:
> I like to ...\
> I like ...

For example,
> I like to watch movies.\
> I like watching movies.\
> I like to play golf.\
> I like playing golf.

You can emphasize how much you like your hobby by adding a word like _really_ in front of "like".
> I really like watching movies.

On the other hand, if you want to play down how much you like something, you can say _kind of_.
> I kind of like playing tennis.

If you don't have any special hobbies, or don't want to be specific, a good way to reply is:
> I like hanging out with my friends, and stuff like that.
