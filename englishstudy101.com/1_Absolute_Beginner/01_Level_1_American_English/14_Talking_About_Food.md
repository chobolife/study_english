# Talking About Food

Of course you can ask someone straight out:
> What kind of food do you like?\
> What sort of food do you like?

Instead it's much better to choose a particular food - such as a famous one from your country, or one that has come up previously in the conversation - and ask if the other person likes that food.
> Do you like sushi?

Possible answers to this are:
> Yeah, I do!\
> Yeah, I do! My favorite type is eel.\
> Yeah, I do! It's so delicious.

But what if you hate sushi? How to give a negative answer?
> Not really...

Or a more idiomatic phrase:
> I'm not a huge fan.

Again, it's good for the conversation, and polite, to give a reason why you don't like the food.
> I don't like the texture.\
> I just don't like the taste.

If you meet someone who likes the same kind of food that you do, a nice way to continue the conversation is to ask them if they know about any good restaurants that serve the food.
> Do you know a good sushi place?\
> Do you know a good place for burritos?
