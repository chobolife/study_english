# Santa Claus Is Coming To Town

You'd better watch out!
You'd better not cry.
Better not pout,
I'm telling you why.
Santa Claus is coming to town.

He's making a list,
and checking it twice;
gonna find out
who's naughty or nice.
Santa Claus is coming to town.

He sees you
when you're sleeping
he knows
when you're awake.
He knows if you've
been bad or good
so be good
for goodness sake!

You'd better watch out!
You'd better not cry.
Better not pout,
I'm telling you why.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
