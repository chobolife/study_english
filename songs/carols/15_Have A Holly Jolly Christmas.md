# Have A Holly Jolly Christmas

- Have a holly jolly Christmas, it's the best time of the year
- Well I don't know if there'll be snow, but have a cup of cheer
***
- Have a holly jolly Christmas, and when you walk down the street
- Say hello to friends you know and everyone you meet
***
- Ho, ho, the mistletoe hung where you can see
- Somebody waits for you, kiss her once for me
***
- Have a holly jolly Christmas and in case you didn't hear
- Oh by golly have a holly jolly Christmas this year
