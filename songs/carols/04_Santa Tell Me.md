# Santa Tell Me

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around and I'm trying to play it cool
but it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
Let it snow is blasting now but I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's true love
that he thinks of so next christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before fell in love on Christmas night
But on new year's day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold, be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's true love
that he thinks of so next christmas I'm not all alone, babe

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh-oh-oh
On the 25th by the fireplace oh-oh-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart this year I've got to be smart

If ya won't be, If ya won't be
