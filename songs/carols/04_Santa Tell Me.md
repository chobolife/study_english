# Santa Tell Me

- Santa, tell me if you're really there
- Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
- Santa, tell me if he really cares
- 'Cause I can't give my heart away if he won't be here next year

- Feeling Christmas all around and I'm trying to play it cool
- But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
- "Let it snow" is blasting now but I won't get in the mood
- I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's
- true love that he thinks of so next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

- I've been down this road before fell in love on Christmas night
- But on New Year's Day, I looked around, he wasn't by my side
- Now I need someone to hold be my fire in the cold
- But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
- true love that he thinks of so next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
