# Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)

- The snow's coming down
- I'm watching it fall
- Lots of people around
- Baby, please come home
***
- The church bells in town
- All ringing in song
- Full of happy sounds
- Baby, please come home
***
- They're singing "Deck the Halls"
- But it's not like Christmas at all
- I remember when you were here
- And all the fun we had last year
***
- Pretty lights on the tree
- I'm watching them shine
- You should be here with me
- Baby, please come home
***
- They're singing "Deck the Halls"
- But it's not like Christmas at all
- I remember when you were here
- And all the fun we had last year
***
- If there was a way
- I'd hold back this tear
- But it's Christmas day
- Baby, please come home
***
- Baby, please come home
- Baby, please come home
- Baby, please come home
- Baby, please come home
