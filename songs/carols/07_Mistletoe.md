# Mistletoe

- It's the most beautiful time of the year
- Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
- I should be playin' in the winter snow
- But I'ma be under the mistletoe
- I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
- But I can't stop staring at your face
- I should be playin' in the winter snow
- But I'ma be under the mistletoe
***
- Shawty, with you
- Shawty, with you
- Under the mistletoe, yeah
***
- Everyone's gathering around the fire
- Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
- I should be chilling with my folks, I know
- But I'ma be under the mistletoe
- Word on the street Santa's coming tonight
- Reindeers flyin' through the sky so high
- I should be making a list, I know
- But I'ma be under the mistletoe
***
- Shawty, with you
- Shawty, with you
- Under the mistletoe
- Shawty, with you
- Shawty, with you
- Under the mistletoe
***
- Hey, love, the wise men followed the star
- The way I followed my heart
- And it led me to a miracle
- Hey love, don't you buy me nothing
- 'Cause I am feeling one thing, your cheek on my lips
- That's a merry, merry Christmas

- It's the most beautiful time of the year

- Shawty, with you

- Under the mistletoe
- Shawty, with you

- Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
- Show me, baby, that you love me so, oh, oh
- Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
- Show me, baby, that you love me so, oh, oh
