# All I Want For Christmas Is You

- All I want for Christmas is you
***
- I don't want a lot for Christmas
- There is just one thing I need
- (And I) don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
- I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
- Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas day
- I just want you for my own more than you could ever know
- Make my wish come true
- All I want for Christmas is you
***
- I won't ask for much this Christmas
- I won't even wish for snow
- (And I) I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
- I won't make a list and send it to the north pole for Saint Nick
- I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click
- 'cause I just want you here tonight holding on to me so tight
- What more can I do?
- Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
***
- Oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
- and the sound of children's laughter fills the air
- and everyone is singing
- I hear those sleigh bells ringing
- Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
- Won't you please bring my baby to me?
***
- I don't want a lot for Christmas
- This is all I'm asking for
- (And I) I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door
- I just want you for my own more than you could ever know
- Make my wish come true
- Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
