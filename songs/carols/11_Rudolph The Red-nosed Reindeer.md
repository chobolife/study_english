# Rudolph The Red-nosed Reindeer

- You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
- Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
- But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all?
***
- Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (Reindeer)
- Had a very shiny nose (Like a lightbulb)
- And if you ever saw it (Saw it)
- You would even say it glows (Like a flishlight)
- All of the other reindeer (Reindeer)
- Used to laugh and call him names; (Like Pinocchio)
- They never let poor Rudolph (Rudolph)
- Join in any reindeer games (Like Monopoly)
***
- Then one foggy Christmas Eve
- Santa came to say (Ho Ho Ho):
- "Rudolph with your nose so bright
- Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
- Then how the reindeer loved him (Loved him)
- As they shouted out with glee, (Yipee!)
- "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, (Reindeer)
- You'll go down in history." (Like George Washington)
