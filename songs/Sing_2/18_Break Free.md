# Break Free

- If you want it, take it
- I should've said it before
- Tried to hide it, fake it
- I can't pretend anymore
***
- I only wanna die alive
- Never by the hands of a broken heart
- I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
- Now that I've become who I really am
***
- This is the part when I say I don't want ya
- I'm stronger than I've been before
- This is the part when I break free
- 'Cause I can't resist it no more
***
- Woah-woah, the thought of your body, I came alive
- It was lethal, it was fatal
- In my dreams, it felt so right
- But I woke up every time
- (Ooh, baby)
***
- This is the part when I say I don't want ya
- I'm stronger than I've been before
- This is the part when I break free
- 'Cause I can't resist it no more
