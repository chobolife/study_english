- I think about him and he knows it
- I wanna let him take control
- 'Cause every time that he gets close, yeah

- He pulls me in enough to keep me guessin' (Oh-oh)
- And maybe I should stop and start confessin'
- Confessin', yeah
***
- Oh, I've been shakin'
- I love it when you go crazy
- You take all my inhibitions
- Baby, there's nothin' hondin' me back
- You take me places
- That tear up my reputation
- Manipulate my decisions
- Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back (Oh-oh-oh)
- There's nothing' holdin' me back (Oh, oh, no)
- There's nothing' holdin' me back

- I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
- If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
- I know we'd be alright, we would be alright
