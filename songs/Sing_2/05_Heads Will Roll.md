# Heads Will Roll

- Oh, oh-oh
- Oh, oh-oh
***
- Off, off with your head
- Dance, dance 'til you're dead, dead
- Heads will roll
- Heads will roll
- Heads will roll on the floor
***
- Glitter on the wet streets
- Silver over everything
- The glitter's all wet
- You're all chrome
***
- I'm dripping with alchemy
- Shiver, stop shivering
- The glitter's all wet
- You're all chrome
***
- The men cry out, the girls cry out
- The men cry out, the girls cry out
- The men cry out, oh no
- The men cry out, the girls cry out
- The men cry out, the girls cry out
- The men cry out, oh no
***
- Oh, oh-oh
- Oh
***
- Off, off with your head
- Dance, dance 'til you're dead, dead
- Heads will roll
- Heads will roll
- Heads will roll on the floor
***
- You can't last
- Take the past
- Shut your eyes
- Realize
- You can't last
- Take the past
- Shut your eyes
- Realize
***
- Glitter on the wet streets
- Silver over everything
- The river's all wet
- You're all chrome
- You're all chrome
***
- Oh, oh-oh
- Oh
***
- Off, off, off with your head
- Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
- Off, off, off with your head
- Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
- Off, off, off with your head
- Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
- Off, off, off with your head
- Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
