# Where the Streets Have No Name

- I wanna run, I want to hide
- I wanna tear down the walls
- That hold me inside
- I wanna reach out
- And touch the flame
- Where the streets have no name
***
- I wanna feel sunlight on my face
- I see the dust-cloud
- Disappear without a trace
- I wanna take shelter
- From the poison rain
- Where the streets have no name
***
- Where the streets have no name
- Where the streets have no name
- We're still building and burning down love
- Burning down love
- And when I go there
- I go there with you
- It's all I can do
