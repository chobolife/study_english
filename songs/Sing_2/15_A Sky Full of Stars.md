# A Sky Full of Stars

- 'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
- I'm gonna give you my heart
- 'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
- 'Cause you light up the path
***
- I don't care, go on and tear me apart
- I don't care if you do, ooh, ooh
- 'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
- I think I saw you-ooh-ooh
***
- I don't care, go on and tear me apart
- I don't care if you do, ooh, ooh
- 'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
- I think I saw you-oh-ooh
***
- I don't care, go on and tear me apart
- I don't care if you do, oh, oh
- 'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
- I think I saw you-oh-ooh
