# I Say A Little Prayer

- Say a little prayer for you
***
- The moment I wake up
- Before I put on my makeup (Makeup)
- I say a little prayer for you
- While combin' my hair now
- And wondering what to wear now (Wear now)
- I say a little prayer for you (For you, ooh)
- Oh, baby
***
- (Forever) Forever, (Forever) ever
- You'll stay in my heart and I will love you
- (Forever) Forever, (And ever) ever
- We never will part, oh, how I love you
- (Together) Together, (Together) together
- To live without you
- Would only mean heartbreak for me
- Ooh, ooh, ooh
***
- I run for the bus, dear
- While riding', I think of us, dear (Us, dear), hey
- I say a little prayer for you, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh, shawty)
- At work I just take time
- And all through my coffee break time (Break time)
- I say a little prayer for you
***
- (Forever) Forever, (Forever) forever
- You'll stay in my heart and I will love you
- (Forever) Forever, (And ever) ever
- We never will part, oh, how I love you
- (Together) Together, (Together) together
- That's how it must be to live without you
- Would only mean heartbreak for me
***
- Only mean heartbreak for me
- Ooh, ooh
