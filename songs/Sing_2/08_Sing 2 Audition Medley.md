# Sing 2 Audition Medley

- Some boys are trying too hard
- He don't try at all through
- Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
- I see nothing better, I keep him forever
- Like a vendetta-ta
- in the middle of the night, in my dreams
- I know I'm gonna be with you
- So I'll take my time
***
- Hi, my name is
- What? My name is
- Who? My name is
***
- Abra, abracadabra, abracadabra
***
- She bangs, she bangs
- Oh baby, when she moves, she moves
***
- What do you want from me?
- Why do you run from me?
- What are you wondering?
- What do you know?
- Why aren't you scared of me?
- Why do you care for me?
- When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
***
- You used to call me on my cell phone
- Late night when you need my love
***
- Talk to me baby
- I'm goin' blind from this sweet-sweet cravin; whoa-oh
- Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
- I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (uh)
- Walk for me, baby
- I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
- Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
- I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean (uh)
