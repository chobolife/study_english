# I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For

- I have climbed the highest mountains
- I have run through the fields
- Only to be with you
- Only to be with you
***
- But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
- But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
- But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
***
- I believe in the Kingdom Come
- Then all the colours will bleed into one
- Bleed into one
- But yes, I'm still running
- You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains
- Carried the cross of my shame
- Of my shame
- You know I believe it
***
- But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
- But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
- But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
- But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
- But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
- But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
