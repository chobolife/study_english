# Stuck in A Moment You Can't Get Out Of

- I'm not afraid
- Of anything in this world
- There's nothing you can throw at me
- That I haven't already heard
- I'm just trying to find
- A decent melody
- A song that I can sing
- In my own company
***
- I never though you were a fool
- But darling, look at you
- You gotta stand up straight
- And carry your own weight
- These tears are going nowhere baby
***
- You've got to get yourself together
- You've got stuck in a moment
- And you can't get out of it
- Oh love, look at you now
- You've got yourself stuck in a moment
- And you can't get out of it
***
- I will not forsake
- The colours that you bring
- The nights you filled with fireworks
- They left you with nothing
- I am still enchanted
- By the llight, you brought to me
- I listen through your ears
- Through your eyes, I can see
***
- And you are such a fool
- To worry like you do, oh
- I know it's tough
- And you can never get enough
- Of what you don't really need now
- My, oh my
***
- You've got to get yourself together
- You've got stuck in a moment
- And you can't get out of it
- Oh love, look at you now
- You've got yourself stuck in a moment
- And you can't get out of it
***
- I was unconscious, half-asleep
- The water is warm 'til you discover how deep
- I wasn't jumping, for me, it was a fall
- It's a long way down to nothing at all
***
- You've got to get yourself together
- You've got stuck in a moment
- And you can't get out of it
- Don't say that later will be better
- Now you're stuck in a moment
- And you can't get out of it
