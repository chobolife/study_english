# Could Have Been Me

- Don't wanna live as an untold story
- Rather go out in a blaze of glory
- I can't hear you, I don't fear you
- I live now 'cause the bad die last
- Dodgin' bullets with your broken past
- Well, I can't hear you, I don't fear you now
***
- Wrapped in your regret
- What a waste of blood and sweat, oh-oh, oh
***
- I wanna taste love and pain
- I wanna feel pride and shame
- I don't wanna take my time
- I don't wanna waste one line
- I wanna live better days
- Never look back and say
- "It could have been me, it could have been me"
- Yeah!
***
- Don't wanna wake up on a Monday morning
- The thought of work is gettin' my skin crawling
- I can't fear you, I don't hear you now
***
- Wrapped in your regret
- What a waste of blood and sweat, oh-oh, oh
***
- I wanna taste love and pain (I wanna taste love)
- I wanna feel pride and shame
- I don't wanna take my time (No, oh, oh)
- I don't wanna waste one line (Hey-hey, hey-hey)
- I wanna live better days (Better days)
- Never look back and say
- "It could have been me" (It could have been me), "it could have been me" (It could have been me)
- I wanna taste love and pain (I wanna taste love and pain)
- I wanna feel pride and shame (I wanna feel pride and shame)
- I don't wanna waste my time (I don't wanna waste my time)
- I don't wanna waste one line (I don't wanna waste one line)
- I wanna live better days
- Never look back and say
- "It could have been me," oh, it could have been me
- It could have been me!
