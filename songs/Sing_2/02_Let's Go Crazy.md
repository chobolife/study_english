# Let's Go Crazy

- Dearly beloved
- We are gathered here today to get through this thing called life
- Electric world life, it means forever and that's a mad and long time, but I'm here to tell you
- There's somethin' else: the afterword
- A world of never-ending happiness
- You can always see the sun
- Day or night
***
- Let's go crazy
- Let's go crazy
- Let's go crazy
- Let's go crazy
***
- If you don't like
- The world you're livin'in
- Take a look around
- At least you got friends
- You see I called my old lady
- For a friendly word
- She picked up the phone, dropped it on the floor
- "Ah, ah" is all I heard
***
- Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down?
- Oh, no, let's go!
***
- Let's go crazy
- Let's get nuts
- Let's look for the purple banana
- 'Til they put us in the truck
- Let's go!
***
- Oh, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
- Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, oh (Yeah, yeah)
***
- We're all excited (All excited)
- Don't know why (Don't know why)
- Maybe it's 'cause
- We're all gonna die
- When we do
- What's it all for? (What's it all for?)
- Better live now
- Before the grim reaper comes knockin' on your door, tell me
***
- Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down?
- Oh, no, let's go!
***
- Let's go crazy (Let's go crazy)
- Let's get nuts (Let's get nuts)
- Look for the purple bananas
- 'Til they put us in the drop
- Let's go!
***

***
- Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down?
- Oh, no, let's go!
***
- Let's go crazy (Let's go crazy)
